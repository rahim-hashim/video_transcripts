# Why OpenAI Paid $6.5 Billion to make the new iPhone & How Google Just Ended Hollywood w/Salim & Dave
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8)
*  OpenAI to buy AI device startup from Apple's Johnny Ive for $6.5 billion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=0.0s)]
*  It's funny in this entire AI battle I've never been a Sam Altman fanboy until now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=6.48s)]
*  The first thing he does is he launches a product that competes directly with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=11.84s)]
*  perplexity, tries to take over search and announces kind of declares war against [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=15.76s)]
*  Google and search. Next thing he does is he goes and gets Johnny Ive and says okay [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=20.72s)]
*  now I'm gonna now I'm gonna start building devices. VO3 Grand Slam home run. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=25.08s)]
*  The future of media is gonna completely flip where it's on demand like this is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  what I want to see created on the fly for me. Curious as to how people are gonna [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=33.72s)]
*  use it at a personal level but will I really use it to generate my own [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=36.76s)]
*  entertainment? Hollywood is decimated. I think continue to exist in two or three [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  years from now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=45.28s)]
*  Now that's the moonshot ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=47.68s)]
*  Hey everybody welcome to Moonshots. I'm here with my moonshot mates Dave Blunden [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=52.76s)]
*  and Salim Ismail and this is an episode of WTF Just Happening Tech. It's been a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=56.86s)]
*  big week guys, a big week on announcements in particular with Google [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=61.08s)]
*  I.O. and our friends over at Anthropic. Dave, where you today? I'm in beautiful [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=65.02s)]
*  Wakefield 10 miles north of MIT. Actually this is a company I founded [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=72.36s)]
*  right after DataSage manages two trillion dollars of there's fifty [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=77.04s)]
*  trillion dollars in the US stock market two trillion of it trades and flows [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=82.12s)]
*  through this building so it seems sleepy but there's a lot of digital movement [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=85.4s)]
*  through this building. You know you throw out trillions like they're nothing but [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=89.6s)]
*  hey it's it's good to know. Good to know someone does that. And Salim I know that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=94.2s)]
*  you're in the bedroom about about three five meters that way so Salim and I are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=98.68s)]
*  actually up in Tiburon. We were at an event last night that our friend of ours [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=103.68s)]
*  threw. Everybody's asleep because they got in at two o'clock in the morning [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=107.64s)]
*  we're in this building on the water here it's gorgeous. It was a conversation on [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=111.88s)]
*  quantum and consciousness it was pretty amazing but we got up at the crack of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  dawn to do this podcast because this is an incredible week. So a lot of you do [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=122.08s)]
*  it okay? You awake? I'm awake and I think this is an incredibly one of the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=128.16s)]
*  busiest weeks we've ever had in terms of tech stuff. So it is. Alright let's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=133.56s)]
*  let's dive in let's talk about AI of it all. That's the the winner this week in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=138.8s)]
*  terms of tech news and I think it's gonna be the winner every week going [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=144.52s)]
*  forward. So Dave would you clue us in on this news? Open AI to buy AI device [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=148.4s)]
*  startup from Apple's Johnnie I for six point five billion dollars. That made [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=156.08s)]
*  headlines. You know it's funny in this entire AI battle I've never been a Sam [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=161.7s)]
*  Altman fanboy until now. This is the move of all moves and I know Sam was talking [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=166.54s)]
*  about this yeah huge huge coup and a very aggressive move and it was really [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=172.98s)]
*  probably in Sam's mind the whole time he was just waiting for the for the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=177.66s)]
*  300 billion dollar valuation so he could afford it but he was talking about this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=180.82s)]
*  what a year ago and at the time he backed off didn't want to kind of wake [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=184.78s)]
*  up the competition and he said you know the iPhone is probably the most perfect [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=189.66s)]
*  device ever made it made by mankind and so trying to compete directly with the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=193.38s)]
*  iPhone and the Android phone is kind of crazy. So he was backing off while he was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=200.38s)]
*  still planning and now now this is the move. So the fundamental thought here is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=205.98s)]
*  that AI is such a game changer all the big tech companies need to have a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=210.62s)]
*  direct-to-consumer device or interface. So you know Metabuy's WhatsApp, Metabuy's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=215.26s)]
*  Instagram, you just got to control the the consumer front end. Google builds [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=222.06s)]
*  Chrome, Google launches Android. Android doesn't even make money. Why does [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=226.98s)]
*  Google need Android? But we need to control the data and the the front [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=230.66s)]
*  interface that the consumer uses every day and of all the big AI companies Sam [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  is the guy who most intuitively seems to get that and and so you know the first [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=240.62s)]
*  thing he does is he launches a product that competes directly with perplexity [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=246.18s)]
*  tries to take over search and announces kind of declares war against Google in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  search. Next thing he does is he goes and gets Johnny Ive and says okay now I'm [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=254.34s)]
*  gonna now I'm gonna start building devices that the consumer interacts with [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=258.54s)]
*  directly. So you know a lot of the other foundation model companies are just [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=262.5s)]
*  trying to build foundation models and let the economy bubble around them. Sam [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=265.98s)]
*  is actually trying to control the high-low and and get the front of the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=269.18s)]
*  consumer and the entire AI backbone. But I think the big insight here is that you [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=273.02s)]
*  can build a consumer device that's AI first which means you're always talking [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  to it. You're interacting with it like a person and that's disruptive enough that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=281.94s)]
*  a lot of the iPhone magic isn't really relevant and so we can potentially leapfrog [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=286.02s)]
*  and bypass that. Then you know to spend six point five billion dollars on a no [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=290.98s)]
*  revenue idea but you're getting the guy and the team and that's very Steve Jobs [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=296.54s)]
*  like we can we can riff on that but I think it's just brilliant. Yeah so the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  question ultimately is what's the next level device gonna be? Is it gonna be [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=305.86s)]
*  glasses? Is it gonna be a device that's just listening all the time and there [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=309.26000000000005s)]
*  are a few different companies coming out with this. Salim you were gonna say? Yeah [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=313.1s)]
*  I mean this I think blitzes us straight to that Jarvis thing of an agent from [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  your perspective always looking at the world and listening and making sense of [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=322.94s)]
*  the world. So I think this is a huge step. As you said Dave very very ballsy and I [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=326.7s)]
*  love it. Yeah actually very similar. Google you know they spent three [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=331.74s)]
*  billion dollars on character AI specifically to get Noam Shazir back. So [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=337.66s)]
*  it's another case where you're willing to write a nine-figure check for a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=342.1s)]
*  fundamentally a single human being but you know that person's gonna bring a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=347.06s)]
*  team with them and they're gonna bring that kind of Steve Jobs magic with them [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=352.18s)]
*  but these price tags are completely unprecedented but then the upside on a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=355.94s)]
*  win is also orders of magnitude bigger than ever before so it's actually very [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  rational. Yeah well can't wait to see what comes up next you know one of the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  questions of course we're gonna have probably a whole slew of AI devices [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=370.6s)]
*  listening to your conversations all the time and I think it's gonna get socially [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=374.06s)]
*  accepted eventually but in the beginning you know as you step into and you're [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=380.18s)]
*  having a conversation with your friend and you notice that they're wearing a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=386.02s)]
*  pendant or something on their head or something on their wrist that's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=389.74s)]
*  listening and the question becomes are you okay with every conversation you're [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=394.62s)]
*  having being recorded because that's where we're heading. That's where we're [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=399.09999999999997s)]
*  heading. You know I think this actually that podcast we had just a couple days [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=403.74s)]
*  ago with Anish is directly related to this too. Anish was pointing out that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=407.18s)]
*  there are huge swaths of demographics you know including older people [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=410.14s)]
*  including just huge swaths of different countries that have completely [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=414.22s)]
*  missed the iPhone Android phone revolution and the AI interface the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=418.94s)]
*  voice interface that's super empathetic opens it up and so you know it's not [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=424.82s)]
*  like you have to stop everyone from using their iPhones tomorrow what you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=429.14s)]
*  need to do is open up whole new territories of users that were largely [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=432.7s)]
*  overlooked before so I think this is likely to penetrate very quickly that way [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=436.98s)]
*  and yeah it'll be like a lightweight easy to use probably dirt cheap device [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=441.06s)]
*  that you're just talking to that has an agent as the core doing everything you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=445.06s)]
*  just ask it to do. Yeah and it's the lurking that's gonna be interesting [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=449.78s)]
*  right where you know you don't know remember when Google came out with [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=454.02s)]
*  Google Glass and they were wearing them to bars and people said they gave them [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=459.06s)]
*  the term glass holes and stuff. Yeah getting beat up. So it's gonna be [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=463.94s)]
*  fascinating we're about to see social norms of interactions with human to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=469.62s)]
*  human with AI there begin to get defined very quickly. Look it started already [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=474.98s)]
*  you know every time I have a zoom meeting now with a few people all their [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=480.38s)]
*  AI show up before they do. You have to go wait we're trying to have a confidential [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=483.54s)]
*  meeting here and then we have to turn them all off and stuff. Yeah actually [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=489.26s)]
*  the shift is happening. You're right. We could rip on that for a sec but the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=493.02s)]
*  regulatory there's no regulation basically the regulators are completely [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=498.7s)]
*  asleep at the wheel but if you look at TCPA and you know you can't tap phone [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=501.9s)]
*  lines and there's very good reasons for that but all of that is now moving to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=506.97999999999996s)]
*  digital where there are no laws whatsoever but you notice when zoom [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=511.06s)]
*  calls started having AI spies on them they announced themselves that's all [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=514.5s)]
*  like now they just listen and they're you don't even know they're there and the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=518.22s)]
*  same with consumer phone calls a lot of our companies have either sales or [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=521.62s)]
*  customer support over the phone is moving to AI voices at an incredible [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=527.7s)]
*  rate using every GPU on the planet by the way. It works incredibly well it's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=530.78s)]
*  far better than a human call operator but most of them don't tell you their AI [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=535.66s)]
*  and there's no there's no regulation that says you have to tell you and so a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=539.86s)]
*  lot of the times I'm listening to the calls the consumer you know about 10 20 [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=544.38s)]
*  percent of the time they're aware they're talking AI the rest of the time [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=547.86s)]
*  they're not but that's amazing I mean that's you know kudos to the designers [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=550.26s)]
*  there I mean that's that's extraordinary and it's just gonna get better and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=554.98s)]
*  better. Every week I study the 10 major tech meta trends that will transform [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=559.02s)]
*  industries over the decade ahead. I covered trends ranging from humanoid [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=563.78s)]
*  robots, AGI, quantum computing, transport, energy, longevity and more. No fluff only [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=567.5s)]
*  the important stuff that matters that impacts our lives and our careers. If you [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=574.3s)]
*  want me to share these with you I write a newsletter twice a week sending it out [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=578.98s)]

*  so this the bottom line sort of Google stole the week at least for a little bit [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=620.66s)]
*  Dave do you want to just outline what we're seeing here this is a slide [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=627.62s)]
*  titled Gemini leads across all models and we're talking about Gemini versus [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=632.62s)]
*  versus GPT 3045 deep-seek grok yeah yeah this is the Empire Strikes Back right [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=637.54s)]
*  here so open AI has stolen the audience the user base and then AI primacy XAI [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=646.58s)]
*  claimed it back in February very briefly then Google came roaring back or sorry [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=655.14s)]
*  opening I came roaring back with new models and then that woke up Google [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=661.54s)]
*  Google's coming in and does the Empire Strikes Back okay we have had this in [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=666.42s)]
*  the lab we didn't know exactly how to announce it or when to announce it but [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=670.78s)]
*  now that the competitive pressures on we're going completely to the wall here [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=674.5799999999999s)]
*  this is the best of everything we've got and we're gonna roll it all out this [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=679.06s)]
*  week and and here you go and it is mind-blowing so they're claiming the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=682.4599999999999s)]
*  number one spot in every single category just we get to it across yeah well so [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=686.68s)]
*  the the one that caught everyone's imagination well overall obviously image [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=694.2399999999999s)]
*  generation hard prompts hard prompts is you know difficult questions that I guess [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=698.92s)]
*  that's pretty obvious coding and math they claimed number one on that for all [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  of a few hours math they still own creative writing saying as people do in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=709.64s)]
*  their English papers long queries so they've actually had dominance in super [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=714.48s)]
*  long context windows for quite a while they just didn't tell the world about it [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=719.16s)]
*  and this is exactly Peter what you were saying a couple weeks ago you know big [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=722.16s)]
*  companies have a real struggle with innovators dilemma and so even though [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=726.0s)]
*  this has been in the lab Demis Asabas and the team have been working on it for [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=729.6s)]
*  a long time they've had it but they were so worried about how to roll it out and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=732.72s)]
*  whether there'd be consumer backlash and but now under competitive pressure you [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  know it's unleashed I mean this is this is Google over and over again I mean [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=741.36s)]
*  Google had transformers first it did all the fundamental work it basically had [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=746.2s)]
*  the equivalent of GPT but decided not to do you know what everybody said don't do [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  this don't put AI out in the open web don't make it accessible to everybody [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=757.02s)]
*  don't let itself referentially program itself and of course once it was [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=760.5600000000001s)]
*  released into the ether Gemini or Google had to come back and demonstrate [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=764.52s)]
*  themselves listen I love Google as a company I'm impressed by their by them [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=769.8s)]
*  and they've got an extraordinary base to build on I'm sorry Salim you were gonna [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=775.92s)]
*  say no you know a few days ago I generated an image of a Gutenberg [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=782.24s)]
*  printing process that's they give me a photograph of it and I did that across [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=786.12s)]
*  several models and the Gemini one was way better than all the others it was [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=789.92s)]
*  incredible and so I think we're gonna find for time the interest is still over [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=795.0s)]
*  with opening eyes a lot of attention there but I think over time the sheer [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=800.68s)]
*  quality will kind of come through what I think if you love a good drama you know [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=804.16s)]
*  the this is the space race times a thousand and and the players keep [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=808.68s)]
*  leapfrogging each other and you'll see later you know that Google's kind of ace [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=813.24s)]
*  in the hole is that it has hardware control hardware design control so you [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=816.72s)]
*  go from algorithm all the way down to chip design with the TPU v7s nobody [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=820.0s)]
*  else has that but the other guys have other competitive weapons we can talk [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=825.28s)]
*  about later in the pod too so don't expect that this is the end in fact I've [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=829.24s)]
*  seen game over said now about 20 times every time someone leaps from someone [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=832.72s)]
*  else it's definitely not game over is game just beginning so if you like a [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=838.4s)]
*  good drama this is just this the next act and we'll see that in a second and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=841.64s)]
*  if they never wonder you know is this field accelerating it is massively [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=845.96s)]
*  accelerating and it's the competitive pressures between these companies it's [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=851.76s)]
*  no longer between countries it's between a set of individual companies that are [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=856.28s)]
*  just trying out do each other the challenge is that chat GPT ie open AI [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=861.08s)]
*  captured the mindset of the world as a first mover advantage you know you know [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=867.28s)]
*  kids throughout elementary through high school and college you know the average [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=872.52s)]
*  mom and dad out there they're all using chat GPT and it's reflected in the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=877.8000000000001s)]
*  revenues that that open AI have Gemini really needs to catch up because I don't [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=881.64s)]
*  care how good you are it if your product is not being used you're in trouble this [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=887.96s)]
*  isn't this is an interesting thing to watch just because it's throughout [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=893.6s)]
*  history even though we kind of talk about first mover advantage it's never [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=896.72s)]
*  been the first mover it didn't made the big bucks right Google wasn't the first [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=901.24s)]
*  search engine Facebook wasn't the first social network opening out has lead it [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=904.8s)]
*  remains to be seen it might actually be a completely new competitor that [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=909.76s)]
*  completely changes the game for everybody oh it will be it will it will [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=914.12s)]
*  be I mean there's no question about it so let's so cure this chart that we're [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=918.4s)]
*  showing if you're watching this on YouTube is Google as number one across [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=924.1999999999999s)]
*  the board but then how many hours later Dave did we get this chart and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=928.4s)]
*  introduces Claude 4.0 yeah it's so amazing little 24 hours there so Sundar [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=934.4s)]
*  gets on stage talks about something we'll look at in a minute which you know [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=943.04s)]
*  you can use just basically all AI all the time and not use regular Google [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=948.24s)]
*  search we'll see it in a second Google stock goes way down then they next day [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=951.96s)]
*  they come out with VO three with a whole bunch of just mind-blowing AI you know [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=958.6s)]
*  number one benchmark stock goes up seven percent you know just in reaction to [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  that so everybody's like what is going on here there's so much chaos right in [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=967.12s)]
*  the middle of it Claude four comes out so Dario is like yeah look Sundar just [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=970.96s)]
*  claimed number one encoding not true well we'll start yesterday now it's not [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=977.0s)]
*  true today we have Claude four and you're the benchmarks and these are [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=981.32s)]
*  accurate by the way you know so that it really is the case that Google was ahead [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=984.6s)]
*  in coding for about 24 hours and now if you look at this chart it's a pretty [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=988.32s)]
*  significant gap actually Claude four has just launched to the top again and [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=993.08s)]
*  those scores on the far left are incredibly meaningful to the people who [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=997.24s)]
*  understand what the implications are you know for like companies like blitzy in [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1001.32s)]
*  our portfolio that do long-form coding three million lines of code in a single [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1005.0400000000001s)]
*  night you know Brian Elliott is all over YouTube talking about it it works [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1008.4s)]
*  fundamentally because of the benchmarks on the far left the the AI can now [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1012.68s)]
*  actually build entire products you know while you're sleeping and you come back [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1015.9599999999999s)]
*  and use it the next day and it's it's functional and that that app that works [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1020.4s)]
*  when these benchmarks get around 80% it doesn't work when these benchmarks are [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1024.56s)]
*  around 50 60 percent they're just too many bugs in the code the next day so [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1028.56s)]
*  even though it doesn't look like much on this chart it's an incredible tipping [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1032.8s)]
*  point in terms of functionality when you get above that 80% level on sui bench [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1035.84s)]
*  and that now we need to reinvent the benchmarks by the way this is sui bench [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1039.6799999999998s)]
*  which is the most fundamental benchmark on how good is the code written by AI [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1043.12s)]
*  there's a new one coming all coming out called sui rebanch which is you're just [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1047.24s)]
*  making it harder and upgrading it but we need new benchmarks now because the AI [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  has basically broken the benchmarks you know when Ray talks about the singularity [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1055.24s)]
*  that point after which you can't predict what's coming next that's what you're [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1059.1999999999998s)]
*  seeing here right you're seeing literally a drop-the-mic moment over and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1063.04s)]
*  over again being leapfrogging everybody else and it's it's awe-inspiring all [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1068.96s)]
*  right here's yet another part of the equation we talked about AI improving [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1075.12s)]
*  based upon a multitude of different factors better hardware more capital [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1081.04s)]
*  coming in and this one is really improvements in algorithms algorithmic [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1086.16s)]
*  improvements and the prediction here is we're gonna see you know a 10x to 100x [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1091.68s)]
*  improvement algorithms Saleem or Dave might not comment on this this is [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  something we've been tracking and say solar energy forever right where the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1103.0800000000002s)]
*  materials become cheaper where lithium-ion batteries have dropped 90% in [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1106.44s)]
*  their price performance over the last decade the same thing and people forget [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1110.64s)]
*  about this they kind of think look at electricity needs on the current models [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1114.4s)]
*  and then they project out everybody goes oh my god oh my god not realizing that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1118.4s)]

*  real-world example the amount of fuel in a plane needed to cross the Atlantic has [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1127.4s)]
*  dropped by two-thirds in the last few decades just because the engines are so [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1132.16s)]
*  much more efficient we know where routes to fly on where's where's the air less [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1136.16s)]
*  resistant etc etc so I think we're gonna see the same thing happening in AI where [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1141.0s)]
*  the models are becoming very much more efficient and that's going to change the [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1145.4s)]
*  game not enough to drive the upside but definitely it'll help hugely on the [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1148.96s)]
*  overall energy needs over time yeah I checked this post and researched it for [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1152.68s)]
*  accuracy and two two things to riff on one is Jevons paradox which I we all [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1158.0800000000002s)]
*  love to talk about actually our good friend Eric Brynjolfsson is probably the [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1164.0400000000002s)]
*  top guy on the planet on on that topic and we should have him on as a guest to [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1168.0400000000002s)]
*  talk about this but and then the other is this is way way way understated so [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1173.0s)]
*  so starting with the way understated this this is worth reading but it was [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1177.32s)]
*  built kind of by extrapolating bottom-up but I know the actual innovations under [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1182.68s)]
*  the covers that are driving this and they're much bigger than this and [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1186.92s)]
*  they're much faster you know software innovation that's that's done by AI can [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1190.6s)]
*  be deployed in real time you're not waiting for any hardware or any you know [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1194.84s)]
*  anything to to come online you just deploy and go and so this will happen [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1198.56s)]
*  much much faster than what's shown on this chart now that the AI can improve [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1204.04s)]
*  itself and the other thing is you know it's it's extrapolating to about a [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1208.24s)]
*  hundred X anywhere from 30 to 240 X but I know that in the quantization of the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1212.36s)]
*  neural nets alone there's about a 20 to 40 X in that dimension then in the chain [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1217.48s)]
*  of reasoning just in that these are all multiplicative by the way so you have [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1222.8799999999999s)]
*  three dimensions that I know are 20 to 100 X's that are multiplicative with [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1226.64s)]
*  each other and so it's going to be more like a thousand to ten thousand X [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1232.24s)]
*  there's a there's a brilliant researcher at MIT Shane Longprey that I was [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1237.24s)]
*  talking to yesterday he desperately want to build a company around him but he [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1240.98s)]
*  has to finish his PhD first and it's frustrating as hell it's just got a few [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1245.0s)]
*  more months to go but but he's doing a lot of great work with you know right [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1248.64s)]
*  now when you use an AI to do something for you build a video or be an [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1253.2s)]
*  agent for you the parameters in there also speaks Swahili and know about [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1256.44s)]
*  quantum you know quantum computer like all this other knowledge is actually [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1261.44s)]
*  being is using up the GPUs and it's using up the compute even though it's [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1266.2s)]
*  not relevant to that question and so you can actually take much smaller subsets [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1271.0800000000002s)]
*  of that great brain to give you just as good an answer and and that's on the [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1275.28s)]
*  order of a hundred X factor by itself so he's wrapping up his research on that [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  right now and then we'll we'll end up trying to productize it so no doubt in [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1283.88s)]
*  my mind that this is way understated both in time and an impact so yeah it's [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1288.5600000000002s)]
*  pretty exciting bottom line when Eric Schmidt says AI is massively underhyped [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1293.72s)]
*  it's the realization that we have all of these knobs we can turn and they're [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1299.4s)]
*  gonna give us improvements each one of them under X improvements times you know [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1304.0s)]
*  five or six different knobs it's let's talk about Jevons paradox for just a [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1308.7s)]
*  second there too and I think this you know no one had ever said Jevons paradox [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1313.16s)]
*  I think for a hundred years until now it's gonna come up every week so he [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1317.3600000000001s)]
*  might as well define it for us all right so here's the deal in normal economics [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1320.6000000000001s)]
*  Eric Ben Yolson is the master of this in normal economics you have supply demand [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1325.3600000000001s)]
*  you know ISLM I don't know if you ever took 1402 at MIT so I did you know so if [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  you said hey I found a way to grow bananas you know they're twice as cheap [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1334.72s)]
*  now they cost half as much you know people people don't consume twice as [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1339.52s)]
*  many bananas because they're half as expensive they consume maybe five percent [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1343.16s)]
*  more bananas that's normal normal economics right price comes down then you [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1346.12s)]
*  know you just you just did that fraction the economy is smaller because the [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1351.16s)]
*  price is lower oil being the classic example of this then you get into tech [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1354.52s)]
*  and something really weird happens where if I make a GPU ten times faster for the [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1358.4s)]
*  same price my video game got better do I use ten times less video game no no I [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1363.94s)]
*  use actually more video game than ever before because it's more fun than it was [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1371.26s)]
*  before so even though it got ten times cheaper my overall consumption of that [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1375.76s)]
*  actually in dollars went goes up not down and that's completely paradoxical [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1380.5800000000002s)]
*  paradoxical for an economist and so you're seeing that most acutely in AI [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1385.26s)]
*  more than ever before if it is more capable because you made the model in [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1390.94s)]
*  this case you know 30 to 240 times more efficient doesn't that bring the need [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1395.6200000000001s)]
*  for GPUs and data centers down and it's not it's gonna go the other direction [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1401.02s)]
*  the need for data centers chips and electricity actually goes up very very [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1404.74s)]
*  steeply and so a lot of people are mispredicting the investment in energy [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1409.6200000000001s)]
*  in data center supply in chips you know chips will be sold out for at least the [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1414.5800000000002s)]
*  next five years and maybe infinitely in the future for exactly this reason [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1420.3s)]
*  because because the capabilities like you know one of those vo3 we'll look at [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1425.1399999999999s)]

*  whether the educational field is going to accept this I don't know how you guys [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1576.5s)]
*  feel about this but you know teachers unions are gonna have to get on the [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1581.2199999999998s)]
*  game here and we're gonna start to see you know do I put my kid in school [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1584.82s)]
*  because they're using old-style or do I use AI to educate my kids thoughts well [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1591.1799999999998s)]
*  yeah you know what one high-level thought on that is Dennis Asabas is [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1598.86s)]
*  gonna push this agenda he's taking the high ground it's really interesting to [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1603.3s)]
*  watch Google now decide look our Nobel Prize winning brilliant guy we're gonna [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1606.34s)]
*  put him on stage and make him a center a centerpiece and he you know he rises to [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1610.26s)]
*  the occasion incredibly well but he can't he can't compete with Sam Altman [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1614.1s)]
*  in the use cases that are gonna propagate you know at light speed which [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1619.6999999999998s)]
*  is you know virtual friends you know creating your own internal copyright [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1624.6999999999998s)]
*  violating versions of movies you know all that stuff he can't touch that [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1630.1399999999999s)]

*  image and here's what Gemini generates whoa I was able to create this just [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1705.62s)]
*  based on a sketch but what if it topped that's where Gemini's native audio comes [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1712.62s)]
*  in that's a pangolin and its scales are made of keratin just like your [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1719.62s)]
*  fingernails today we're making 2.5 pro even better by introducing a new mode [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1724.58s)]
*  we're calling deep think deep think uses our latest cutting-edge research in [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1730.42s)]
*  thinking and reasoning including parallel techniques we are in a new [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1736.02s)]
*  phase of the AI platform shift but decades of research are becoming reality [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1740.5s)]
*  for people all over the world introducing Google beam a new AI first [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1746.02s)]
*  video communications platform beam uses a new state-of-the-art video model to [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1752.5s)]
*  transform 2d video streams into a realistic 3d experience so let me pause [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1759.82s)]
*  at Google beam here Salim and Dave we had a chance to see Google beam at the [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1765.62s)]
*  abundance summit this year and it's not you know my 12 my 13 year old boys were [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1770.94s)]
*  with me and they said it was the coolest thing they saw at the at the tech hub [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1776.3799999999999s)]
*  right the ability to actually be there now Cisco tried this years ago and it [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1780.1399999999999s)]
*  was expensive multi-million dollar hardware I don't know if the price point [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1785.86s)]
*  has been announced yet on Google beam but it's gonna be sort of an appliance [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1789.18s)]
*  that's in your home when you want to contact your mom yeah for sure it can be [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1792.1000000000001s)]
*  very cheap and I think this is a very big deal because you can think about the [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1798.22s)]
*  language potential that comes with it all the other capabilities will come [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1802.02s)]
*  with it I think it'll up the game for companies like zoom and force them into [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1806.78s)]
*  a new innovation cycle also that's nice yeah we need to talk about price point [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1812.78s)]
*  for a second here too because a lot of this stuff is just mind-blowing and you [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1817.82s)]
*  need to experience it and then Google says well to access anything I'm showing [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1821.46s)]
*  you here you got to get a Google ultra or Gemini ultra account for 250 bucks a [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1825.46s)]
*  month and so we move on their part ballsy ballsy and you know one of things [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1829.22s)]
*  I love about this podcast is like this is the the actionable like we're trying [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1834.3999999999999s)]
*  to improve people's life choices and trajectories through life by giving them [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1839.1s)]
*  as much actionable information as possible and a lot of people who listen [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1843.22s)]
*  to this podcast are gonna say I don't 250 bucks a month that's like rent so [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1847.1s)]
*  the good news is you can you can try it at half price for a couple months and [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1852.3799999999999s)]
*  then cancel your subscription if you want so you but you definitely got to [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1855.86s)]
*  try it I mean you Google Google Google's trained us to get everything for free [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1858.54s)]
*  right and just give up our rights and such I mean open AI has proven a $20 [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1864.06s)]
*  price point is acceptable to most individuals I'll give up a couple of [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1869.54s)]
*  days and have access to the world's intelligence 250 bucks that's I think I [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1872.78s)]
*  think I think it'll become mandatory for anybody in the professional modality [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1880.06s)]
*  mm-hmm because I also think tools will be so rich that and there'll be enough [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1884.66s)]
*  there for them to do quite well out of it I think but it was six months ago a [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1889.86s)]
*  lot of people were saying look foundation models are a race to the [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1893.94s)]
*  bottom there are commodity you know the price points will come down these [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1897.18s)]
*  $300 billion valuation for open AI is insane you know given that it'll [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1902.58s)]
*  commoditize now it's got to be obvious to everyone that all of that was wrong [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1906.7s)]
*  just absolutely could not have been more wrong the the cape because you're a [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1911.22s)]
*  foundation model company the capabilities that you can invent and [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1915.54s)]
*  launch and the price point that they'll command is is astronomical and then [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1918.46s)]
*  right now any of our listeners are basically going through what's [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1923.54s)]
*  inevitable I can't be competitive if I don't have my hands on this I need to [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1927.34s)]
*  try it I'm gonna drop behind society if I don't get on top of this well sorry [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1932.06s)]
*  that's gonna cost you 250 bucks right away and I noticed that you know it took [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1937.1s)]
*  my money instantly but it took 24 hours for me to make my first my first vo3 [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1940.74s)]
*  videos like wow this thing is over I'm interpreting that as it's over [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1945.62s)]
*  subscribed and overloaded so it's obvious like a race one thing one thing [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1949.5s)]
*  Dave which is the capabilities that existed before you know when I say [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1954.62s)]
*  before last month you know last quarter will be available for free right we're [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1959.82s)]
*  gonna still get a lot of fundamentals for free but if you want the cutting [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1965.74s)]
*  edge that price will be increasing over time let's let's jump back in here we [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1969.24s)]
*  are introducing this real-time speech translation directly in Google me it's [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1976.3799999999999s)]
*  nice to finally talk to you is bueno hablar de finalmente no puedo esperar [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1980.98s)]
*  so instant translation we've been seeing this for a while now I think it's gonna [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1986.6599999999999s)]
*  be fascinating to incorporate across all the video platforms I mean right now [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1992.9399999999998s)]
*  YouTube is translating our podcast in every language out there that's [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=1998.6599999999999s)]
*  fantastic zoom is gonna have to catch up to Google meet any comments on [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2003.34s)]
*  translation Salim I mean I travel a lot and this will be so great to hold up my [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2007.98s)]
*  phone and do real-life transitional conversations in different countries I'm [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2013.78s)]
*  super excited about this there there's such enablement that comes from this [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2018.1s)]
*  we've been kind of tickling at it's been available in kind of a clunky form for a [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2023.58s)]
*  long time I think this sounds like it gets to a level of seamlessness from a [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2028.36s)]
*  user interface perspective that could change the game so Salim this directly [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2032.82s)]
*  affects our side bet which we need to finalize by the way Peter needs to [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2037.18s)]
*  adjudicate that this the side that we agreed to a few weeks ago where I see [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2040.26s)]
*  the forces of concentration of wealth into just a few hands are overwhelming [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2044.64s)]
*  and then the forces of democratization are moving much more slowly and so and [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2050.58s)]
*  and you your side that was no this is gonna benefit broad swaths of humanity [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2056.82s)]
*  you know on a more and we haven't we haven't quantified that so we we have to [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2061.14s)]
*  settle that but I'm willing to put any amount of money you want behind it but [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2065.14s)]
*  here it changes the definition before so you can put down trillions and I'll [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2068.54s)]
*  put down a few bucks we'll see how that goes [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2072.9s)]
*  all right I want a big point exchange [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2075.54s)]
*  you know listen as a parent and you're listening to this you know in the past [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2078.54s)]
*  you would say oh it's really important for my kids to learn French or Greek or [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2082.94s)]
*  Turkish or Japanese whatever your cultural roots are or whatever you think [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2087.86s)]
*  you know you need to learn Mandarin because China is rising the world and [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2091.9s)]
*  then you need to load coding right coding was always like pushing your kids [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2096.5s)]
*  learn to code so now we have this digital world allowing us to do coding [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2100.38s)]
*  through natural language if I'd coding and why would I ever learn a language if [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2106.6600000000003s)]
*  I can just be translated instantly so there's an interesting social [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2110.86s)]
*  re-engineering going on here because of course when you learn to code you learn [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2117.1800000000003s)]
*  how to think in a different way and when you learn languages you learn culture in [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2121.6600000000003s)]
*  a different way which is going to be obviated through here so I'm fascinated by this [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2126.06s)]
*  there's something that will I think will persist here and the reason is that [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2130.74s)]
*  when you learn a new language your brain rewires in fundamentally different [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2134.54s)]
*  it's the same way so many creative people play music are into music is it [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2139.2999999999997s)]
*  because their brain rewires fundamentally around a different paradigm [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2144.34s)]
*  and you triangulate now you've got different brain neural circuits that you [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2148.02s)]
*  In India when they have kind of countrywide maths competitions it's always won by dang South Indian [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2152.42s)]
*  their ability to do mathematics is like 10x and everybody up in the north of India and they worked out [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2159.86s)]
*  that it has to do with the structure of the language the rhythmic patterns on the structure [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2168.02s)]
*  keep make their minds naturally available for that I think the idea of learning piano or learning [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2172.82s)]
*  coding or learning certain deep skills or languages will persist just because it will create so much [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2178.06s)]
*  more creativity in people and more creativity will be the only thing that's available for humanity going forward [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2184.54s)]
*  Well the reason I think this affects our side bet Salim is because there's latent talent all over the world [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2190.94s)]
*  and it's usually locked up behind language barriers and now that the translation is real-time [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2196.9s)]
*  but it also keeps your voice intonation so your natural voice you can actually make a real [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2203.02s)]
*  friend in a different country where you don't have a common language and I think that's new in the world [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2207.94s)]
*  we don't know where it's going to go exactly but all of our successful startups are dominated by this [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2213.98s)]
*  theme of best friends grinding it out working 24x7 [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2217.98s)]
*  Oh my god that's brilliant Dave I mean our ability now to find I mean there's so much talent in Pakistan [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2222.02s)]
*  in India in parts of Southeast Asia that are locked up and don't have access to our capital markets [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2227.98s)]
*  You know you can imagine we have we have Link Studios as part of Link exponential Ventures there on the campus of MIT [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2235.1s)]
*  or adjacent to it and we're opening up Abundance Studios here in LA you can imagine tapping into that deep bench [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2242.1s)]
*  and having natural conversations like we have with our buddies down the street [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2251.1s)]
*  So can we just say that I won the bet right now? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2256.1s)]
*  We can't, we can't [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2259.18s)]
*  I'm jumping back into Google I.O. we got a lot to cover here [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2262.18s)]
*  Our research prototype Project Mariner [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2266.18s)]
*  It's an agent that can interact with the web and get stuff done [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2269.18s)]
*  We released it as an early research prototype in December and we have made a lot of progress since [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2274.18s)]
*  and we are starting to bring agentic capabilities to Chrome, Search and the Gemini app [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2280.18s)]
*  Let me show you what we are excited about we call it Agent Mode [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2286.2599999999998s)]
*  Say you want to find an apartment for you and two roommates in Austin [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2291.2599999999998s)]

*  Using Agent Mode the Gemini app goes to work behind the scenes [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2302.2599999999998s)]

*  Now imagine if those responses could sound like you [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2310.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the idea behind personalized smart replies [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2314.34s)]
*  With your permission Gemini models can use relevant context across your Google apps [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2317.34s)]
*  In a way that is private, transparent and fully under your control [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2323.34s)]
*  Let's say my friend wrote to me looking for advice [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2328.34s)]
*  He's taking a road trip to Utah and he remembers I did this trip before [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2331.34s)]
*  Gemini can do almost all the work for me [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2336.34s)]
*  Looking up my notes in Drive, scanning past emails for reservations [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2340.42s)]
*  Gemini matches my typical greetings from past emails [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2345.42s)]
*  Captures my tone, style and favorite word choices [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2349.42s)]
*  And then it automatically generates a reply [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2354.42s)]
*  Wow, just wow [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2357.42s)]
*  So this is Agent Mode there and Google's ability to personalize [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2360.42s)]
*  in a very deep and meaningful fashion [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2365.42s)]
*  I'm blown away [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2368.5s)]
*  Listen, the fact of the matter is their goal is to get everybody to switch over [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2371.5s)]
*  from iPhones to Android and from Outlook to all of Google's suite [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2376.5s)]
*  And it's getting compelling [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2382.5s)]
*  It's going to be to a point where I want that [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2385.5s)]
*  This cost of switching platforms is huge [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2388.5s)]
*  And if Google is able to provide enough eye candy and enough cognitive candy [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2391.5s)]
*  to get me to switch, that's a big deal [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2396.58s)]
*  The use case they demo is so funny to me [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2399.58s)]
*  because Sundar is like, hey, suppose I want to go to Utah [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2402.58s)]
*  and I want to rent a bike [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2405.58s)]
*  Come on, man [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2407.58s)]
*  What we already did this week here at Vesmark is [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2408.58s)]
*  we took that same agent to agent and MCP capability [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2411.58s)]
*  and we moved it inside our firewall [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2415.58s)]
*  and it now opens inbound emails and Outlook with trade requests [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2417.58s)]
*  Then the AI will read the trade request, automatically trade the account [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2422.66s)]
*  We're talking about trillions of dollars here [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2427.66s)]
*  generate the trade file automatically and then route it out [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2429.66s)]
*  And so we're already using that exact capability [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2432.66s)]
*  in a much higher leverage use case [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2435.66s)]
*  but completely built the artificial operator [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2438.66s)]
*  The financial services industry spends about $100 billion a year [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2443.66s)]
*  on back office operations related to these activities [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2446.66s)]
*  And when we sample them, every single one of them [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2450.74s)]
*  is possible to do with AI now [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2453.74s)]
*  If you're willing to connect it to sensitive information, financial accounts [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2455.74s)]
*  and you find a way to put it behind your firewall [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2458.74s)]
*  And so they just rolled that out here this week [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2462.74s)]
*  And it's such a huge unlock [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2466.74s)]
*  But when you get on the stage like this, you've got to talk about something [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2468.74s)]
*  like, hey, I'm renting a bike [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2471.74s)]
*  Why does Sundar sound like an AI? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2474.74s)]
*  I mean... [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2477.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, his name is Pitch AI [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2480.8199999999997s)]
*  So that's why they chose him, I think, to be CEO [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2482.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh no, that's terrible [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2485.8199999999997s)]
*  But Sundar is in the maelstrom, right? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2488.8199999999997s)]
*  And he's got Sergey and Larry looking over your shoulders [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2491.8199999999997s)]
*  And he's got the innovator's dilemma again [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2494.8199999999997s)]
*  Their entire revenue base has been Google search [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2496.8199999999997s)]
*  Not entire revenue base, two-thirds of their revenues [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2499.8199999999997s)]
*  They've got YouTube, which is incredible [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2502.8199999999997s)]
*  They've got Waymo [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2504.8199999999997s)]
*  They've got a whole slew of other [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2506.9s)]
*  But, you know, switching things over [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2508.9s)]
*  And we'll see this in a minute [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2511.9s)]
*  Switching this over, away from search [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2513.9s)]
*  They have to do this in order to continue to survive and grow [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2516.9s)]
*  Any comment on the agent element, Salim, or the personalization? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2521.9s)]
*  Does it feel weird to have the AI searching all your emails [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2527.9s)]
*  and responding on your behalf? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2532.9s)]
*  I mean, I find that incredible [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2535.98s)]
*  The responding on our behalf is a little creepy [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2538.98s)]
*  and a little unnerving, right? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2541.98s)]
*  Because you don't know what it's going to say, etc, etc [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2542.98s)]
*  I think it's just one of these things [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2545.98s)]
*  We'll just get used to it [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2546.98s)]
*  And it'll become routine fairly quickly [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2548.98s)]
*  The initial emotional reaction will be there for people [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2551.98s)]
*  I think the potential is much, much bigger here [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2555.98s)]
*  on the business side than on the personal side [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2558.98s)]
*  The bee-to-bee implications of this type of stuff [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2561.98s)]
*  are off the hook for customer service responses [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2564.06s)]
*  and all sorts of things [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2567.06s)]
*  So I think we'll see a lot more agendic AI stuff [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2568.06s)]
*  at the enterprise level than at the personal level [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2571.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think that... [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2575.06s)]
*  So much to talk about [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2577.06s)]
*  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2578.06s)]
*  This is rich, we could spend days on this stuff [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2580.06s)]
*  But I wonder if you say you want to hear it [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2583.06s)]
*  On the consumer side, everybody worries about privacy [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2586.06s)]
*  But then they roll out functionality that you just absolutely have to have [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2589.06s)]
*  Absolutely have to have and you have no choice [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2592.14s)]
*  So you always check the box [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2594.14s)]
*  How many times a day do you push the accept button? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2595.14s)]
*  You don't even know what you just accepted [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2597.14s)]
*  I mean, privacy is long since dead [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2598.14s)]
*  I mean, come on [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2600.14s)]
*  People want privacy, but your Alexa is listening [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2601.14s)]
*  Your Siri is listening [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2605.14s)]
*  Everything is listening all the time [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2606.14s)]
*  Privacy is a great thing to desire [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2608.14s)]
*  And I don't accept that it's true [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2611.14s)]
*  Well, that is why the truly brilliant Demis-Hassabis types [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2614.14s)]
*  and Mark Pincus, our friend [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2618.14s)]
*  They need to get involved in regulatory [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2620.22s)]
*  Which, you know, probably the last thing they thought [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2623.22s)]
*  when they were a kid growing up [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2625.22s)]
*  is that they'd get involved in regulation [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2627.22s)]
*  But at the rate these capabilities are coming out [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2629.22s)]
*  if people like that don't get involved in regulation [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2631.22s)]
*  I mention those guys in particular [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2634.22s)]
*  because they're genuinely concerned [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2636.22s)]
*  and they really want a functional, non-dystopian future [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2638.22s)]
*  And we have to use AI as a tool [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2641.22s)]
*  in creating the regulation on AI [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2644.22s)]
*  There's no other way it's going to keep up [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2646.22s)]
*  So it's heartwarming that people like Demis [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2648.2999999999997s)]
*  are at the top of the stack [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2651.2999999999997s)]
*  because they're just incredibly humanist [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2652.2999999999997s)]
*  good natured people [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2655.2999999999997s)]
*  So that's encouraging [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2656.2999999999997s)]
*  But on the government side [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2659.2999999999997s)]
*  This is a Rubicon we crossed a long time ago [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2662.2999999999997s)]
*  Like in the US, there is no right to privacy anymore [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2665.2999999999997s)]
*  It's been totally dissolved, right? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2668.2999999999997s)]
*  And you're going to get [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2670.2999999999997s)]
*  The best framing I've seen for this [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2671.2999999999997s)]
*  is consider you're living in a global airport [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2673.2999999999997s)]
*  Like in an airport [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2676.38s)]
*  You know you're being surveilled [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2677.38s)]
*  and your rights can be taken away at any time [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2679.38s)]
*  And essentially that's essentially transmitting now [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2681.38s)]
*  down to every aspect of life [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2683.38s)]
*  in every country [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2685.38s)]
*  But it's going to be so convenient [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2687.38s)]
*  to give your AI access to your conversations [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2690.38s)]
*  and your emails [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2693.38s)]
*  It's going to make the world automagical for you [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2694.38s)]
*  that turning that off [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2697.38s)]
*  will be like turning off half of your cognitive capacity [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2700.38s)]
*  Again, I think [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2704.46s)]
*  Remember Peter, like 10 years ago at Singularity [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2705.46s)]
*  We played that video of Mark Zuckerberg [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2708.46s)]
*  It was an onion clip of Mark Zuckerberg [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2710.46s)]
*  And they said, wow, that was the best CIA agent ever [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2712.46s)]
*  He got the whole world to just tell us where they were [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2715.46s)]
*  We don't even need spies anymore [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2717.46s)]
*  Because that really just tells us where they are [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2718.46s)]
*  So Mark Zuckerberg, here's an award [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2721.46s)]
*  for greatest CIA agent in history [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2723.46s)]
*  I think this is where we've been going down this road [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2726.46s)]
*  for a long time [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2730.46s)]
*  And there's no [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2731.46s)]
*  don't think there's any going back from it [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2732.54s)]
*  I had meetings with two of the biggest insurance companies [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2735.54s)]
*  top Fortune 50s earlier this week [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2738.54s)]
*  And I said, look, you guys [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2741.54s)]
*  how are you going to act on this? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2743.54s)]
*  You need to act on it like tomorrow [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2744.54s)]
*  And one of them wants to use AI to do their quarterly closing [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2746.54s)]
*  So you can't talk about [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2749.54s)]
*  like as a public company [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2750.54s)]
*  So there's nothing more sensitive in the world [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2751.54s)]
*  than your quarterly closing data [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2753.54s)]
*  And they said, well, we have two choices [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2756.54s)]
*  Microsoft says, just give it all to us [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2758.54s)]
*  Trust us [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2761.62s)]
*  We've already got all your emails in Outlook [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2762.62s)]
*  So just throw it over to us and trust us [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2764.62s)]
*  And they're like, that sounds kind of scary [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2767.62s)]
*  But maybe [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2769.62s)]
*  The other choice is to take Lama 4 [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2770.62s)]
*  distill it and bring it in-house inside their firewall [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2773.62s)]
*  And that's jarred up heaven right there [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2776.62s)]
*  And very, very viable as a solution [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2778.62s)]
*  They just need a vendor to come in and wire it up for them [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2780.62s)]
*  So I think a lot of the companies and countries [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2783.62s)]
*  that care about their future [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2786.62s)]
*  are going to take that latter path [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2788.62s)]
*  But the alternative is to concede every aspect of your life [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2790.7s)]
*  your data and everything [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2793.7s)]
*  to either OpenAI, Microsoft or Google or XAI [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2795.7s)]
*  It's just not viable for sovereign states [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2798.7s)]
*  for a lot of fintechs to take that path [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2803.7s)]
*  So it's an interesting, very, very dynamic time [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2807.7s)]
*  I am jumping back into the Google I.O. video here [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2811.7s)]
*  Alright, let's do it [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2814.7s)]
*  Gemini Flash is our most efficient workhorse model [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2816.7s)]
*  The new Flash is better in nearly every dimension [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2819.7799999999997s)]
*  improving across key benchmarks [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2822.7799999999997s)]
*  for reasoning, code and long context [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2824.7799999999997s)]
*  Flash will be generally available in early June [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2827.7799999999997s)]
*  with Pro soon after [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2830.7799999999997s)]
*  Gemini Diffusion is a state-of-the-art [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2832.7799999999997s)]
*  experimental text diffusion model [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2835.7799999999997s)]
*  that leverages this parallel generation [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2837.7799999999997s)]
*  to achieve extremely low latency [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2839.7799999999997s)]
*  The version of Gemini Diffusion we're releasing today [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2842.7799999999997s)]
*  generates five times faster [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2845.7799999999997s)]
*  than our fastest model so far [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2847.86s)]
*  This is our ultimate vision for the Gemini app [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2849.86s)]
*  to transform it into a universal AI assistant [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2852.86s)]
*  In Project Astra, we've upgraded voice output [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2856.86s)]
*  to be more natural with native audio [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2858.86s)]
*  We've improved memory and added computer control [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2860.86s)]
*  A quick aside, you've probably heard me [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2863.86s)]
*  speaking about fountain life before [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2865.86s)]
*  and you're probably wishing [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2867.86s)]
*  Peter, would you please stop talking about fountain life? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2868.86s)]
*  The answer is no, I won't [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2871.86s)]
*  because genuinely we're living through a healthcare crisis [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2872.86s)]
*  You may not know this [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2876.94s)]
*  but 70% of heart attacks have no precedence [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2877.94s)]
*  no pain, no shortness of breath [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2879.94s)]
*  and half of those people with a heart attack [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2881.94s)]
*  never wake up [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2883.94s)]
*  You don't feel cancer until stage 3 or stage 4 [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2884.94s)]
*  until it's too late [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2887.94s)]
*  but we have all the technology required to detect [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2888.94s)]
*  and prevent these diseases early at scale [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2891.94s)]
*  That's why a group of us including Tony Robbins [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2894.94s)]
*  Bill Capp and Bob Haruri [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2896.94s)]
*  founded Fountain Life [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2898.94s)]
*  a one-stop center to help people understand [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2899.94s)]
*  what's going on inside their bodies [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2901.94s)]
*  before it's too late [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2904.94s)]
*  and to gain access to the therapeutics [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2906.02s)]
*  to give them decades of extra health span [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2908.02s)]
*  Learn more about what's going on inside your body [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2910.02s)]
*  from Fountain Life [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2912.02s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com slash Peter [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2913.02s)]
*  and tell them Peter sent you [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2915.02s)]
*  Okay, back to the episode [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2917.02s)]
*  We are going to show a video example [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2919.02s)]
*  of Project Astra [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2923.02s)]
*  I mean, listen, Jarvis is here [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2924.02s)]
*  My ability to talk to Astra [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2926.02s)]
*  and ask it to do things for me [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2929.02s)]
*  research things for me [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2931.02s)]
*  show me where something is in the room [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2933.02s)]
*  I mean, it's insane [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2935.1s)]
*  We'll come back to this [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2936.1s)]
*  because the example video is so compelling [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2937.1s)]
*  but I just, you know [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2940.1s)]
*  I've been tracking the Jarvis if you would [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2942.1s)]
*  and it's finally here [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2946.1s)]
*  and thank you to Google for providing it [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2948.1s)]
*  to more people than any other product in the world [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2950.1s)]
*  In our biggest markets like the US and India [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2953.1s)]
*  AI overviews are driving over 10% growth [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2956.1s)]
*  in the types of queries that show them [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2959.1s)]
*  What's particularly exciting [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2962.18s)]
*  is that this growth increases over time [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2964.18s)]
*  We are introducing an all new AI mode [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2967.18s)]
*  It's a total reimagining of search [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2970.18s)]
*  With more advanced reasoning [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2973.18s)]
*  you can ask AI mode longer [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2975.18s)]
*  and more complex queries [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2977.18s)]
*  We're excited to start rolling out AI mode [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2979.18s)]
*  for everyone in the US starting today [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2981.18s)]
*  Over time, we'll graduate many of AI modes [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2984.18s)]
*  cutting edge features and capabilities [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2987.18s)]
*  directly into the core search experience [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2989.18s)]
*  That starts today [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2991.2599999999998s)]
*  as we bring the same models that power AI mode [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2992.2599999999998s)]
*  to power AI overviews [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2995.2599999999998s)]
*  So you can bring your hardest questions [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2997.2599999999998s)]
*  right to the search box [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=2999.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay, big move on Google's part [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3001.2599999999998s)]
*  Very, very ballsy [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3004.2599999999998s)]
*  Bet the company move [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3005.2599999999998s)]
*  It would be great to overlay the stock price [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3009.2599999999998s)]
*  with this exact timeline [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3011.2599999999998s)]
*  because this is exactly when the stock started plummeting [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3012.2599999999998s)]
*  and it clearly cannibalizes the core business [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3015.2599999999998s)]
*  It's incredibly impressive [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3019.34s)]
*  that they're willing to do that [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3020.34s)]
*  And then right after that, they roll out [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3022.34s)]
*  They have to [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3025.34s)]
*  But they got it all back and more the next day [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3026.34s)]
*  when they rolled out all the incredible AI capabilities [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3029.34s)]
*  So it's actually paid off [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3032.34s)]
*  By the end of the week, it worked as a strategy [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3033.34s)]
*  But everybody knows OpenAI is running away [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3036.34s)]
*  with the actual AI user base [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3039.34s)]
*  and Google is miles behind [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3042.34s)]
*  But now they're going to claim [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3044.34s)]
*  that while anyone doing a Google search [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3045.34s)]
*  that turns on the AI mode [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3046.34s)]
*  is an AI user [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3048.42s)]
*  So we're actually ahead of OpenAI [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3049.42s)]
*  So that's pretty smart and aggressive too [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3051.42s)]
*  It's interesting [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3053.42s)]
*  I have my family members and friends say [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3054.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, I asked chat [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3057.42s)]
*  They have a personal relationship with ChatGPT [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3059.42s)]
*  They've given it a name [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3063.42s)]
*  AI mode, you need to personalize these AIs [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3065.42s)]
*  if they become part of your everyday life [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3070.42s)]
*  And so I guess I had a conversation with Gemini [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3072.42s)]
*  So I guess I had a conversation with Gemini [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3075.5s)]
*  is where it's going to go [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3078.5s)]
*  Salim, what are you thinking about this? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3079.5s)]
*  I think kudos to them for doing this [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3081.5s)]
*  It would be really easy to hunker behind the old search box [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3084.5s)]
*  and just leave it the way it was while they experiment [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3089.5s)]
*  But to make something this aggressive [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3092.5s)]
*  where it's built right into the core product that they have [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3094.5s)]
*  is incredibly courageous [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3097.5s)]
*  I agree they don't have much of a choice [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3100.5s)]
*  But many other companies would not have done this [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3102.5s)]
*  So let's see where this goes [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3104.58s)]
*  I think we step back from this too [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3106.58s)]
*  The reason America works fundamentally [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3108.58s)]
*  is because startups innovate and push the agenda [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3110.58s)]
*  This capability would have been buried inside Google for years [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3114.58s)]
*  Maybe forever [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3119.58s)]
*  without the competitive pressure [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3120.58s)]
*  So it's a great little case study [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3122.58s)]
*  What we need to preserve in the American economy [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3124.58s)]
*  is exactly this dynamic [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3127.58s)]
*  where the big guys only move [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3128.58s)]
*  if we keep funding the small guys [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3130.58s)]
*  If the IPO economy and the venture economy ever fell apart [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3132.66s)]
*  this whole country would just grind to a halt [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3136.66s)]
*  And so this is a great case study in it [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3139.66s)]
*  I love it [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3141.66s)]
*  Well said [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3142.66s)]
*  All right, let's jump back in [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3143.66s)]
*  Let me make a point related to that [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3144.66s)]
*  If Google was a European company [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3147.66s)]
*  this would never have happened [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3149.66s)]
*  Yep [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3150.66s)]
*  Yep [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3151.66s)]
*  Yeah [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3152.66s)]
*  All right [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3153.66s)]
*  Let me find where we were [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3154.66s)]
*  It's like having my very own sports analyst [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3155.66s)]
*  right in search [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3158.66s)]
*  Search figured out that the best way to present this information [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3159.74s)]
*  is a graph [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3162.74s)]
*  and it created it [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3163.74s)]
*  Complex analysis and data visualization [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3165.74s)]
*  is coming this summer [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3167.74s)]
*  for sports and financial questions [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3169.74s)]
*  Using your camera, Search can see what you see [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3171.74s)]
*  and give you helpful information [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3174.74s)]
*  as you go back and forth in real time [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3176.74s)]
*  We're bringing Project Mariner's agentic capabilities [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3178.74s)]
*  into AI mode [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3182.74s)]
*  Search can take work off my plate [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3183.74s)]
*  while still under my control [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3186.74s)]
*  Search helps me skip a bunch of steps [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3188.8199999999997s)]
*  linking me right to finish checking out [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3190.8199999999997s)]
*  Tickets secured [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3193.8199999999997s)]
*  With AI mode, we are bringing a new level of intelligence [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3195.8199999999997s)]
*  to help you shock the Google [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3199.8199999999997s)]
*  Search dynamically generates a browsable mosaic of images [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3201.8199999999997s)]
*  and some shockable products [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3206.8199999999997s)]
*  personalized just for me [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3208.8199999999997s)]
*  To create a try-on experience that works at scale [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3210.8199999999997s)]
*  we need a deep understanding of the human body [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3213.8199999999997s)]
*  and how clothing looks on it [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3216.9s)]
*  To do this, we build a custom in a generation model [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3218.9s)]
*  specifically trained for fashion [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3222.9s)]
*  All right, here we go, Apple [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3224.9s)]
*  I mean, Google's getting into Amazon's business [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3226.9s)]
*  You know, instant shopping [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3229.9s)]
*  It's going to be an interesting overlay there [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3231.9s)]
*  Dave? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3233.9s)]
*  This feels like they're just throwing everything against the wall [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3234.9s)]
*  I mean, just throw it all out there [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3237.9s)]
*  I'll tell you the dirty little secret behind this though [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3240.9s)]
*  Google's doing a great job [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3243.9s)]
*  Google's search volume went flat back in 2017 [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3245.98s)]
*  They stopped reporting it years ago because it's flat [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3248.98s)]
*  But the revenue just keeps going up and up and up and up [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3251.98s)]
*  And they say, well, look, we don't show any more ads [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3254.98s)]
*  than we ever showed before [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3256.98s)]
*  But what they actually do is they took all the ads off [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3258.98s)]
*  the low value searches [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3260.98s)]
*  So baseball scores being a great example [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3262.98s)]
*  And they amped up the ads like crazy [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3264.98s)]
*  on the topics that drive all the revenue [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3267.98s)]
*  So that's auto insurance, mortgage, jobs, travel [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3269.98s)]
*  Just one or two other categories drive all the revenue [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3272.98s)]
*  So now as they roll this out [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3275.06s)]
*  Notice the examples they give are baseball scores [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3277.06s)]
*  There's no revenue there anyway [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3281.06s)]
*  So they move that over to AI [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3283.06s)]
*  And then the other one is shopping [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3285.06s)]
*  where they got crushed by Amazon [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3286.06s)]
*  Something like 60 or 70% of all shoppable product search [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3288.06s)]
*  You go straight to Amazon [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3290.06s)]
*  You don't even start on Google [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3292.06s)]
*  And so they're not winning that war anyway [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3294.06s)]
*  So they're basically going to claim AI supremacy [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3296.06s)]
*  and try to move only the categories [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3300.06s)]
*  that are low click-through rate revenue over [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3302.14s)]
*  And they're very good at optimizing that balance internally [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3306.14s)]
*  So this is their way of trying not to cannibalize too much [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3309.14s)]
*  while claiming more users than OpenAI has [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3312.14s)]
*  And you know, there's nothing [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3315.14s)]
*  I think they're going to go after Amazon here [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3317.14s)]
*  on purchases, right? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3319.14s)]
*  If I'm in the AI mode with Gemini [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3321.14s)]
*  and I'm talking about things [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3327.14s)]
*  and it pops up and says, by the way, you can purchase it here [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3329.22s)]
*  Seamless shopping in the middle of conversations [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3333.22s)]
*  or in the middle of doing research [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3335.22s)]
*  having to shift over to Amazon [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3337.22s)]
*  It's going to be an invasion in Amazon's revenue engine [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3340.22s)]
*  That's a great point [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3345.22s)]
*  And actually in all of this PR war [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3347.22s)]
*  that's like Claude coming out right on top of this event [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3349.22s)]
*  and everyone's jumping on each other [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3351.22s)]
*  But Amazon is notably silent [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3353.22s)]
*  even though they do have a ton going on inside AWS [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3355.22s)]
*  I know they're working on it [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3358.2999999999997s)]
*  They have a plan for sure [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3360.2999999999997s)]
*  They just don't seem to be fighting the PR war [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3362.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and then Apple's sort of just giving up altogether [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3364.2999999999997s)]
*  That is so scary [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3367.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, so weird [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3369.2999999999997s)]
*  It is so weird [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3371.2999999999997s)]
*  All right, let's jump back in here [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3372.2999999999997s)]
*  This is the future of Google Search [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3374.2999999999997s)]
*  A search that goes beyond information to intelligence [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3376.2999999999997s)]
*  Our goal is to make Gemini [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3379.2999999999997s)]
*  the most personal, proactive, and powerful AI assistant [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3382.2999999999997s)]
*  Gemini Live now includes camera and screen sharing [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3387.38s)]
*  All of it is rolling out free of charge [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3390.38s)]
*  in the Gemini app on Android and iOS today [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3392.38s)]
*  We're bringing our latest and most capable [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3395.38s)]
*  image generation model into the Gemini app [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3398.38s)]
*  It's called Imagine 4 [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3402.38s)]
*  The images are richer [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3404.38s)]
*  with more nuanced colors [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3406.38s)]
*  and fine-grained details [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3408.38s)]
*  Today, I'm excited to announce [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3410.38s)]
*  our new state-of-the-art model [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3413.38s)]
*  VO3 [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3415.46s)]
*  VO3 comes with native audio generation [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3417.46s)]
*  That means that VO3 can generate sound effects [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3420.46s)]
*  background sounds, and dialogue [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3424.46s)]
*  They left behind a ball today [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3428.46s)]
*  It bounced higher than I can jump [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3430.46s)]
*  What manner of magic is that? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3433.46s)]
*  This ocean, it's a force [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3436.46s)]
*  A wild, untamed might [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3438.46s)]
*  All right, VO3 Grand Slam home run [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3440.46s)]
*  Oh my God, extraordinary [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3443.54s)]
*  Dave, you started playing with it [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3446.54s)]
*  when you got your $250 account [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3448.54s)]
*  How easy was it? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3450.54s)]
*  Oh my God, it's trivial [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3452.54s)]
*  You've got to get the account and just play with it [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3454.54s)]
*  It's instantly mind-blowing [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3456.54s)]
*  The integration of the audio [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3458.54s)]
*  I think really puts it over the top [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3460.54s)]
*  But it's immediately obvious to you [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3462.54s)]
*  that the future of media [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3464.54s)]
*  is going to completely flip where it's on demand [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3466.54s)]
*  This is what I want to see created on the fly for me [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3468.54s)]
*  And as soon as, every time you do a VO3 [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3470.54s)]
*  it's clipped at 8 seconds [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3472.62s)]
*  and you immediately want a full feature-length movie [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3474.62s)]
*  And you're like, well, why can I only get 8 seconds? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3476.62s)]
*  And the answer is there aren't enough GPUs on the planet [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3478.62s)]
*  There's enough compute on the planet [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3481.62s)]
*  to meet the demand of everybody [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3483.62s)]
*  who wants this instantaneously [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3485.62s)]
*  And that gives you a sense of where [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3487.62s)]
*  how many data centers and Chase Lockmiller, Caruso's [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3489.62s)]
*  are going to succeed [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3493.62s)]
*  Because just that use case alone [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3495.62s)]
*  will use up everything [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3497.62s)]
*  let alone customer service and code writing [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3499.62s)]
*  and white-collar, all of these things combined [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3501.7s)]
*  But it's amazing that Josh Woodward got this unit [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3503.7s)]
*  This is the keystone [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3506.7s)]
*  This is it [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3508.7s)]
*  And Peter, you're buddy Josh got it [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3510.7s)]
*  Yeah, Josh was on stage with us [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3512.7s)]
*  at the Abundance Summit this year [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3514.7s)]
*  He's a great presenter [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3516.7s)]
*  But it was awesome [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3518.7s)]
*  Salim, what are your thoughts on VO3? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3520.7s)]
*  I think it'll be interesting as people start [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3523.7s)]
*  I'm curious as to how people are going to use it [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3527.7s)]
*  at a personal level [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3529.7799999999997s)]
*  There's obviously business uses, etc [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3531.7799999999997s)]
*  But will I really use it to generate my own entertainment? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3533.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure I would [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3536.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, we watch movies [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3538.7799999999997s)]
*  particularly because people have curated an experience for us [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3540.7799999999997s)]
*  So I think this will be great for the professional filmmakers [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3545.7799999999997s)]
*  and it'll be great for making pilots [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3549.7799999999997s)]
*  All sorts of stuff will come through with this [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3551.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't think it will affect the end consumer that much [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3554.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know about that [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3557.86s)]
*  Gemini 3, Gemini 4 [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3559.86s)]
*  One of these will have looked at every movie I love [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3563.86s)]
*  It'll understand the context, the nuance of what I really enjoy [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3566.86s)]
*  If it's got a camera facing at me [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3571.86s)]
*  it'll understand when I'm smiling, when I'm frowning [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3573.86s)]
*  when I'm making reactions to it [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3575.86s)]
*  And it can generate a... [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3577.86s)]
*  Imagine you want the next season of a particular TV show [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3579.86s)]
*  I'd love to see the next season of the original Star Trek [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3584.94s)]
*  You'll have that [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3587.94s)]
*  That's a great example, Peter [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3590.94s)]
*  Every Netflix series from Earth to the Moon [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3593.94s)]
*  You always want more when you get to the end [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3599.94s)]
*  And they just physically can't create more [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3602.94s)]
*  Well, now they can [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3604.94s)]
*  And whether it's passive or active [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3605.94s)]
*  Real-time and created for you [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3607.94s)]
*  Or it's just the producers can now create the episodes [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3609.94s)]
*  That much more quickly and cheaply [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3613.02s)]
*  You're never going to let Harry Potter [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3615.02s)]
*  You're never going to let the audience just drop [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3617.02s)]
*  Oh, this is the last book, this is the last movie [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3619.02s)]
*  Disappear [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3621.02s)]
*  That's just crazy inefficient [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3622.02s)]
*  To just let the audience fall off a cliff [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3624.02s)]
*  So now that'll probably never happen again [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3626.02s)]
*  Whether it's just because production costs are much lower [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3628.02s)]
*  Or because people can create their own [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3631.02s)]
*  Either way, that trend will happen [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3633.02s)]
*  But I'd love to side-bit with you on this one too, Salim [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3635.02s)]
*  I think that movie producers have always dwelled on this concept [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3638.1s)]
*  That people are fundamentally lazy [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3643.1s)]
*  But I don't think that's true [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3645.1s)]
*  I think that the medium, the passive medium [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3646.1s)]
*  If you go into a dark theater on a sunny day in LA [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3649.1s)]
*  And you come out of that dark theater [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3651.1s)]
*  And the sun's blaring [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3653.1s)]
*  You feel like crap [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3654.1s)]
*  You love the movie [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3655.1s)]
*  But you feel like, where am I? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3656.1s)]
*  The ability now to keep the dialogue going [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3658.1s)]
*  You can move around and keep it going [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3661.1s)]
*  And you can guide it in the direction you want [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3663.1s)]
*  That's going to be so compelling for people [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3665.1s)]
*  I don't think the producers have mastered the new medium yet [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3667.18s)]
*  But when they do, I think [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3670.18s)]
*  I just want to, I just Googled this [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3672.18s)]
*  And it says, what's the average shot time for a movie today? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3675.18s)]
*  So a modern movie, the average shot length is between 2.5 to 6 seconds [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3679.18s)]
*  In an action film, it's 2 to 3 seconds per shot [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3684.18s)]
*  And a drama or art film, it's 8 to 10 seconds per shot [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3687.18s)]
*  So, you know, if there are any physical limitations here [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3690.18s)]
*  You can just cobble these together [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3693.18s)]
*  But Hollywood is decimated [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3695.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3700.2599999999998s)]
*  I drive by all the studios out in Hollywood when I'm in LA [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3701.2599999999998s)]
*  And how do they continue to exist in two or three years from now? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3706.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you're dead right on that too [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3713.2599999999998s)]
*  Because look at Bollywood and how successful that's been [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3715.2599999999998s)]
*  And why? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3718.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, it's because, look, the movies are culturally aligned [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3719.2599999999998s)]
*  And it just aligns with the audience [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3722.34s)]
*  But why did all the movies pop up in LA in the first place? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3725.34s)]
*  Well, it's because we need to shoot the scenes outside in good weather [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3728.34s)]
*  It's way too expensive to move all the equipment inside [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3731.34s)]
*  Every time it rains in New York [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3734.34s)]
*  So we've got to set up out here where we have good weather [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3735.34s)]
*  But now, you know, this kind of content is weather independent [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3738.34s)]
*  And it's global and it's language independent [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3741.34s)]
*  So it's just talent constrained [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3744.34s)]
*  So yeah, you're right [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3746.34s)]
*  It should be democratized and moved across the world very quickly now [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3747.34s)]
*  All right, let's jump into the Google I.O. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3751.42s)]
*  We've got three quarters in, one quarter left to go [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3754.42s)]
*  A new Synth ID detector can identify if an image, audio track, text or video has Synth ID in it [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3759.42s)]
*  Based on our collaboration with the creative community [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3766.42s)]
*  We've been building a new AI filmmaking tool for creatives [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3768.42s)]
*  We're calling it Flow and it's launching today [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3773.42s)]
*  Let me show you how it works [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3777.42s)]
*  These are my ingredients [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3779.42s)]
*  The old man and his car [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3780.5s)]
*  We make it easy to upload your own images into the tool [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3783.5s)]
*  It lets you extend the clip too [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3786.5s)]
*  So I can get the perfect ending that I've been working towards [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3789.5s)]
*  But what about emerging form factors that could let you experience an AI assistant in new ways? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3795.5s)]
*  That's exactly why we're building Android XR [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3802.5s)]
*  Right now you should be seeing exactly what I'm seeing through the lens of my Android XR glasses [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3806.58s)]
*  Like my delicious coffee over here [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3812.58s)]
*  And that text from Sram that just came in [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3814.58s)]
*  Let's see what he said [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3816.58s)]
*  All right, it's definitely show time [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3819.58s)]
*  So I'm going to launch Gemini and get us going [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3821.58s)]
*  Gemini, what was the name of the coffee shop on the cup I had earlier? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3824.58s)]
*  Hmm, that might have been Bloomsgiving [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3829.58s)]
*  Okay, Gemini, show me what it would take to walk here [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3831.58s)]
*  It'll take you about an hour [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3834.66s)]
*  Okay, I can get some steps in [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3836.66s)]
*  And these heads up directions and a full 3D map should make it super easy [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3839.66s)]
*  I'm excited to announce today that Gentle Monster and Warby Parker will be the first eyewear partners to build glasses with Android XR [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3844.66s)]
*  All right, so I mean [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3855.66s)]
*  I would give anything to be at the next Apple board meeting [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3857.66s)]
*  Because you've got Sam Altman saying I'm getting Johnny [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3861.74s)]
*  I'm going to do devices [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3865.74s)]
*  And I've got Google saying iMovie, get out of the way [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3867.74s)]
*  We've got much better AI driven [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3870.74s)]
*  And you know, what's next? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3873.74s)]
*  Oh my God [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3875.74s)]
*  I mean, this is where Apple should pay the price [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3877.74s)]
*  They haven't done anything to even try [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3879.74s)]
*  Crazy [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3882.74s)]
*  Celine, I mean XR glasses [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3884.74s)]
*  I mean, we're [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3887.8199999999997s)]
*  It's about time that we've got some good AR up and running [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3889.8199999999997s)]
*  But it's going to change our behavior, right? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3893.8199999999997s)]
*  So every day as I'm walking down the street [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3896.8199999999997s)]
*  Do I have education mode on? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3898.8199999999997s)]
*  Do I have gameplay mode on? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3900.8199999999997s)]
*  Do I have entertainment mode on? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3901.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's going to become the major educational partner [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3903.8199999999997s)]
*  If we let it [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3907.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, Warby Parker coming in [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3908.8199999999997s)]
*  Maybe they'll look good [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3910.8199999999997s)]
*  Maybe they'll look fashionable [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3911.8199999999997s)]
*  Maybe you won't look like a geek if you're wearing them [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3912.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't think anything can help you [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3914.9s)]
*  not look like a geek when you're wearing those glasses [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3916.9s)]
*  But I was playing with the meta glasses [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3919.9s)]
*  Peter, that you handed out at A360 last year [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3922.9s)]
*  They were amazing [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3925.9s)]
*  They look like good sunglasses [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3927.9s)]
*  They act like good sunglasses [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3929.9s)]
*  And they've got all this AI capability built into them [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3931.9s)]
*  And it was really quite fascinating to see [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3934.9s)]
*  That was just like version one [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3936.9s)]
*  The next level versions are going to be 100 times more capable [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3938.9s)]
*  With AR built into the middle of it [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3941.9s)]
*  I think this is going to be quite a game changer around this [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3943.98s)]
*  I think it would be really amazing to see the use cases [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3946.98s)]
*  And the potential utility is off the hook [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3949.98s)]
*  Every day I get the strangest compliment [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3951.98s)]
*  Someone will stop me and say [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3954.98s)]
*  Peter, you have such nice skin [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3955.98s)]
*  Honestly, I never thought I'd hear that from anyone [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3957.98s)]
*  And honestly, I can't take the full credit [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3960.98s)]
*  All I do is use something called OneSkin OS1 twice a day every day [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3962.98s)]
*  The company is built by four brilliant PhD women [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3967.98s)]
*  Who've identified a peptide [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3970.98s)]
*  That effectively reverses the age of your skin [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3973.06s)]
*  I love it [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3976.06s)]
*  And again, I use this twice a day every day [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3977.06s)]
*  You can go to Oneskin.co [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3980.06s)]
*  And write Peter at checkout for a discount [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3982.06s)]
*  On the same product I use [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3984.06s)]
*  That's Oneskin.co [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3986.06s)]
*  And use the code Peter at checkout [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3988.06s)]
*  Alright, back to the episode [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3990.06s)]
*  Alright, let's hit a few [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3992.06s)]
*  I'm going to exit out of the Google IOs summary there [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3994.06s)]
*  A lot of amazing stuff [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3997.06s)]
*  And kudos to Sundar and Sergey Brin [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=3998.06s)]
*  And I'm going to end the show with a shout out to the Oneskin team there [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4001.14s)]
*  For the work that they've done [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4004.14s)]
*  They really came out on top this week [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4005.14s)]
*  And if you look at Polymarket [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4008.14s)]
*  You know, who's going to be leading AI by the end of May [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4010.14s)]
*  The Polymarket results show Google at 80% [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4014.14s)]
*  Anthropic at 19% [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4017.14s)]
*  XAI at 1% [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4018.14s)]
*  Okay, seems rational and reasonable [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4021.14s)]
*  And then let's take a look at what Polymarket predicts [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4024.14s)]
*  By the end of the year 2025 [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4028.14s)]
*  38% [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4030.22s)]
*  OpenAI is back at 26% [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4031.22s)]
*  And XAI is at 23% [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4033.22s)]
*  That makes sense, I think, for me [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4035.22s)]
*  OpenAI is going to [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4037.22s)]
*  This is a battle between the two of them [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4039.22s)]
*  And then of course you've got Elon coming out of right field [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4041.22s)]
*  And you know, never bet against Elon is my [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4045.22s)]
*  My mantra here [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4048.22s)]
*  Any comments on this, Dave? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4050.22s)]
*  This is the most entertaining thing in the world to watch [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4052.22s)]
*  But you said Google's back on top [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4054.22s)]
*  But look, they were number 3 in March on this chart [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4056.22s)]
*  So everyone had written them off [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4059.2999999999997s)]
*  And you can actually put money on this [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4061.2999999999997s)]
*  If you want to make a living out of betting on [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4063.2999999999997s)]
*  Who's leapfrogging who [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4065.2999999999997s)]
*  But at this stage, despite this chart [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4067.2999999999997s)]
*  It's just a four-horse, all-out race [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4070.2999999999997s)]
*  Everyone going as fast as humanly possible [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4072.2999999999997s)]
*  So I don't think the short-term trend [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4074.2999999999997s)]
*  Which vaulted Google to the top [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4079.2999999999997s)]
*  Is that it's going to actually flip [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4081.2999999999997s)]
*  Many more times over the next year [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4086.2999999999997s)]
*  Among these four players [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4088.38s)]
*  But there's this level of intense energy [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4090.38s)]
*  We haven't ever seen before [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4093.38s)]
*  And it's what's accelerating our AI future [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4095.38s)]
*  It's also the most important race [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4099.38s)]
*  In the history of human innovation [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4101.38s)]
*  The implications are so much bigger [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4104.38s)]
*  Than the past races we've seen [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4107.38s)]
*  So the amount of money, the amount of energy [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4110.38s)]
*  The short timeline [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4112.38s)]
*  If you want to track one thing and enjoy it [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4114.38s)]
*  In your lifetime, this is it [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4116.46s)]
*  I'm going to just hit on a couple more VO slides [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4119.46s)]
*  We saw this slide here [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4125.46s)]
*  But you made this one, Dave [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4127.46s)]
*  Tell us about it [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4129.46s)]
*  It was my very first ever VO3 [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4131.46s)]
*  So I just wanted to memorialize it [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4133.46s)]
*  Okay, let's play it [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4135.46s)]
*  What was your prompt? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4137.54s)]
*  It's right there [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4140.54s)]
*  Make me a video of data centers getting overrun by dinosaurs [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4141.54s)]
*  I couldn't believe how good it was [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4143.54s)]
*  No reprompting, no tuning [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4145.54s)]
*  This is what it comes back with [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4147.54s)]
*  But I had Chase Lockmiller and Crusoe and Project Stargate [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4149.54s)]
*  In the back of my mind [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4151.54s)]
*  Because Chase has become a celebrity overnight [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4153.54s)]
*  More power to him [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4156.54s)]
*  He's our fellow M.I.C.E. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4157.54s)]
*  And he's a great guy [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4159.54s)]
*  And he's a great guy [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4160.54s)]
*  And he's a great guy [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4162.54s)]
*  And he's a great guy [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4164.54s)]
*  And I want to say thank you to him [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4166.62s)]
*  He's our fellow M.I.T. alum [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4168.62s)]
*  And Crusoe, he's the company building Stargate in Abilene, Texas [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4170.62s)]
*  So I was watching the video [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4174.62s)]
*  Of this insanely large amount of construction [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4176.62s)]
*  The electricity, the pipes, the power generation [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4180.62s)]
*  And now the chips are going to start coming in [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4182.62s)]
*  And that's worth following [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4184.62s)]
*  Just as a storyline by itself [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4186.62s)]
*  Chase is a great, great guy [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4188.62s)]
*  He'll be another Mark Zuckerberg character [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4190.62s)]
*  For a long time to come [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4192.62s)]
*  to be overrunning it before it's even done, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4194.62s)]
*  but it was just what was on my mind. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4197.14s)]
*  All right, there's one more VO3 I need to show, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4199.9s)]
*  and I find it fascinating. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4203.14s)]
*  All of us, you know, evening TV, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4204.62s)]
*  you see these pharmaceutical ads that are ridiculous, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4206.78s)]
*  and they spend a lot of money on these ads. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4210.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, this is an example of a pharmaceutical ad [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4212.28s)]
*  made for 500 bucks instead of $500,000, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4215.78s)]
*  and just take a quick listen to this one. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4219.7s)]
*  I tried everything for my depression. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4222.06s)]
*  Nothing worked. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4224.780000000001s)]
*  Every day felt heavy. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4226.06s)]
*  I felt trapped. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4227.700000000001s)]
*  Then I tried Puppermint. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4229.1s)]
*  Our prescription helps your body secrete [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4230.9400000000005s)]
*  a special pheromone that attracts puppies. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4233.42s)]
*  So, that movie, the commercial goes on, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4237.42s)]
*  and it's hilarious. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4240.620000000001s)]
*  But, I mean, it's like, that for me [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4243.820000000001s)]
*  would be the equivalent of an ad campaign [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4247.5s)]
*  for something that makes your, you know, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4250.66s)]
*  nevermind, I'm not gonna go there. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4255.0599999999995s)]
*  All right, so. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4256.46s)]
*  That looked chompingly real. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4257.3s)]
*  It did, it did. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4259.94s)]
*  All right, so this is my favorite Google IOPs, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4260.78s)]
*  and this is, for me, the materialization of Jarvis. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4264.98s)]
*  I wanna play this, look at this, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4268.54s)]
*  and then let's talk about holy shit moments, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4270.3s)]
*  and how this is gonna change our lives. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4273.08s)]
*  Can you go on YouTube and find a video for how to fix that? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4275.54s)]
*  Of course, I'm opening YouTube now. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4278.7s)]
*  This looks like a good video. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4284.0599999999995s)]
*  Place a rubber band over the head of the screw. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4285.58s)]
*  Oh, nice, nice. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4287.74s)]
*  Can you go through my emails with the bike shop [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4289.0199999999995s)]
*  and find which size hex nut I need? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4291.139999999999s)]
*  Sure, according to the email from Bicycle Habitat, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4293.74s)]
*  you need a 3 1⁄8 inch hex nut for your sprocket. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4296.9s)]
*  I've highlighted the correct bin for you. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4299.82s)]
*  It seems like I need a spare tension screw. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4302.0199999999995s)]
*  Can you call the nearest bike shop [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4305.3s)]
*  and see what they have in stock? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4306.62s)]
*  Yep, calling them now. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4308.06s)]
*  I'll get back to you with what they have in stock. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4309.860000000001s)]
*  I think my brake pads are wearing down. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4312.06s)]
*  Can you check the manual again [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4314.14s)]
*  and see if it talks about them anywhere? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4315.34s)]
*  According to the manual, if you look on page 24. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4317.02s)]
*  Hey, do you wanna get lunch? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4319.22s)]
*  Yeah, give me five minutes. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4322.5s)]
*  Can you finish what you were saying? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4324.900000000001s)]
*  As I was saying, if you look on page 24, section two, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4326.700000000001s)]
*  you'll see how to replace the brake pads. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4331.02s)]
*  Hey, any updates on that call? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4332.900000000001s)]
*  Yep, I just got off of the bike shop. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4335.3s)]
*  They confirm they have your tension screw in stock. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4337.74s)]
*  Would you like me to place a pickup order? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4340.0199999999995s)]
*  Could you show me some examples of dog baskets [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4342.179999999999s)]
*  I can put on my bike? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4344.7s)]
*  Sure, I can help you with that. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4345.78s)]
*  Just give me a moment. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4347.42s)]
*  Here are some options. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4349.66s)]
*  I think Zuka would look really great in these. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4351.0199999999995s)]
*  Jarvis baby is here. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4356.7s)]
*  If I'm better, I wanna free myself from holding the phone. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4358.22s)]
*  I wanna have my eyewear and my audio pickups [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4362.58s)]
*  and have it see what I'm seeing. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4365.7s)]
*  Holy moly. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4367.78s)]
*  Well, this is a good place for me to make a shout out [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4370.46s)]
*  to all our sovereign leader friends [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4372.46s)]
*  in the Middle East and elsewhere. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4374.34s)]
*  What you just saw is not actually gonna happen [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4375.9800000000005s)]
*  in your country. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4378.58s)]
*  And the reason is because the compute, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4380.22s)]
*  you don't have access to the compute. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4383.14s)]
*  You can do this for the next few months, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4385.58s)]
*  but then all the other use cases that are bubbling up [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4387.66s)]
*  are gonna overbid you for that data center space. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4390.02s)]
*  And then your population is not gonna be able to do [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4392.82s)]
*  what they just saw unless you have some kind [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4395.42s)]
*  of a national compute plan. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4398.26s)]
*  And like we said last time, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4400.14s)]
*  about 180 out of 200 countries have no plan whatsoever. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4403.62s)]
*  And you have to get on that right now [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4408.3s)]
*  if you want what you just saw to actually exist [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4410.26s)]
*  in your population, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4412.26s)]
*  and they're gonna be screaming for it. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4413.38s)]
*  Wow, it is, it's magical powers, it's superpowers. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4415.54s)]
*  That's so true. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4420.54s)]
*  We are so compute limited. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4421.7s)]
*  It is the currency of the future. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4423.22s)]
*  It's oxygen for us. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4424.9s)]
*  And it's a basic human right. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4427.0599999999995s)]
*  It's gonna be more important [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4428.219999999999s)]
*  than other basic human rights within a year or two. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4429.38s)]
*  And populations don't recognize that today, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4432.3s)]
*  but once they experience that, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4434.42s)]
*  and then they're deprived of it, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4435.58s)]
*  then they'll all be all over their leaders. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4437.219999999999s)]
*  Wow, how quickly a miracle becomes something we expect [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4439.9s)]
*  and feel like we deserve. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4444.54s)]
*  Salim, what did you think of that Jarvis moment? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4447.54s)]
*  The video's amazing. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4451.74s)]
*  Once you can get all the millions of little YouTube clips [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4452.58s)]
*  activated and useful in this kind of seamless way, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4456.82s)]
*  holy moly, that's pretty incredible. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4460.98s)]
*  I wanna touch back on what Dave said though. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4463.54s)]
*  It's incredible what's happening in this realm. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4467.22s)]
*  And then you look at country policy for most countries [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4471.14s)]
*  and they're like unbelievably backward. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4474.26s)]
*  I was talking to the head of state [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4478.0599999999995s)]
*  of one of the country that's emerging [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4480.34s)]
*  that's about to become a very big, very wealthy country. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4482.820000000001s)]
*  And their first idea was let's build a call center. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4486.26s)]
*  And they're like, no. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4491.22s)]
*  They're like, there's four generations. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4492.22s)]
*  Let's at least get into the 19th century. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4495.14s)]
*  Forget the 20th century. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4497.26s)]
*  You forget the 21st century. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4498.5s)]
*  And this is where I think smart people at government level [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4500.1s)]
*  are going to need to be there to really change the game. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4504.66s)]
*  Because almost every country in the world [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4507.66s)]
*  does policy defensively and reactively. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4510.34s)]
*  Only two places do it positively and forward looking, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4513.58s)]
*  which is Dubai and Singapore. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4516.5s)]
*  And I don't think they don't do it that well. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4519.099999999999s)]
*  And so imagine you had a really forward looking policy [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4521.38s)]
*  in any country could really change the game. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4523.86s)]
*  So I think one or two or three are gonna start doing it [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4525.86s)]
*  and then we're gonna see this general transformation [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4529.34s)]
*  in government, but boy, this is gonna change the, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4531.86s)]
*  I think this will be the forcing function [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4534.82s)]
*  that drives that transformation. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4536.98s)]
*  So that's very exciting. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4538.46s)]
*  I wanna add, listen, when I think of this as Jarvis, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4539.86s)]
*  the counter-revealing partner to Jarvis is Tony Stark. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4543.379999999999s)]
*  Tony Stark is this radical billionaire [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4547.179999999999s)]
*  who has accessed this incredible AI capability. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4550.54s)]
*  But guess what? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4553.94s)]
*  This capability is now available to everybody. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4555.0599999999995s)]
*  We're demonetizing and democratizing [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4557.5s)]
*  our vision of this future. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4560.099999999999s)]
*  And that's extraordinary. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4562.259999999999s)]
*  And that's gonna weigh in on you winning the bet here, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4563.78s)]
*  Selim versus me. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4567.62s)]
*  I was just about to say that. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4568.46s)]
*  Oh, I have, all right. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4569.98s)]
*  I think from beginning to end of this episode. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4571.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, we have to finalize. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4573.099999999999s)]
*  Beginning to end of this episode. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4573.94s)]
*  I think we're done. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4575.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't wanna give away too much of, all right. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4577.74s)]
*  Well, let's finalize the bet first [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4580.139999999999s)]
*  and then I'll tell you why I'm gonna win. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4581.5s)]
*  All right. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4582.9s)]
*  All right, this is a... [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4583.74s)]
*  But you actually, Peter, I wanna tell you, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4584.58s)]
*  we're in a, between Selim and New York, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4585.9s)]
*  me at MIT and you in LA, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4589.18s)]
*  we're booting up a new company right now [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4591.74s)]
*  that takes advantage of, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4593.74s)]
*  you saw that synthetic ad is just as good as a real ad now. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4594.94s)]
*  But we ran some tests over at EverQuote using celebrity ads [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4598.299999999999s)]
*  and they work incredibly well. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4601.299999999999s)]
*  And one of the problems you run into there [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4603.379999999999s)]
*  with like LeBron James is that his peak click-through rate [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4604.74s)]
*  or his peak impression value is right during the playoffs [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4607.419999999999s)]
*  when he can't go to a studio and shoot a video. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4610.339999999999s)]
*  And so we tested two things. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4613.299999999999s)]
*  If you make a synthetic LeBron James at peak season, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4614.94s)]
*  what's the click-through rate? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4618.82s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4619.66s)]
*  And then also if you make thousands of variants of the ad [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4620.66s)]
*  where LeBron is doing different things, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4623.58s)]
*  maybe different languages, just different messages, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4625.18s)]
*  that also incredibly drives up the value of the ad. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4627.54s)]
*  So what we're working on right now is a company that makes, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4630.7s)]
*  basically the celebrity just needs to check a box [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4633.7s)]
*  and collect money. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4635.54s)]
*  And they don't have to show up and shoot anything. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4636.98s)]
*  Everything else is done by AI. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4638.82s)]
*  Super. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4640.42s)]
*  And that'll also get a lot of your LA superstar, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4641.26s)]
*  your movie star friends who you see all the time, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4643.62s)]
*  they never show up at MIT. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4645.74s)]
*  Only Will.i.am and... [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4647.7s)]
*  Well, they don't show up for anything half the time. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4649.54s)]
*  They always show up at their own movie openings. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4653.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4656.06s)]
*  Well, you'd be amazed if you get Will.i.am or anyone [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4657.14s)]
*  to show up on MIT's campus, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4661.740000000001s)]
*  the students come out by the hundreds. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4663.58s)]
*  They just way overreact to a celebrity. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4665.3s)]
*  So I'm really excited about this project dragging [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4667.58s)]
*  just a handful over to the campus. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4670.26s)]
*  I love it. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4672.42s)]
*  Here's a quick fun tweet from Dario saying, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4674.38s)]
*  2026, we'll see the first $1 billion company [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4677.94s)]
*  with one human employee. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4681.339999999999s)]
*  We've been predicting this for a while. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4682.54s)]
*  I get it. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4684.139999999999s)]
*  And I agree. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4685.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if you guys... [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4687.099999999999s)]
*  Two years ago, you and I were launching the EXO 2.0 book [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4687.94s)]
*  and we said it would take three employees [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4691.78s)]
*  and AI to deliver. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4694.099999999999s)]
*  So that's not shrunk to one. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4695.46s)]
*  It'll soon shrink to zero, by the way. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4697.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, with agents and crypto. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4700.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4703.219999999999s)]
*  Well, who gets the money? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4704.299999999999s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4705.219999999999s)]
*  The agent. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4706.339999999999s)]
*  This is the whole Dow paradigm coming to life. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4708.5s)]
*  Yeah, the distributed autonomous organization. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4712.5s)]
*  For me, probably one of the most exciting things [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4716.0199999999995s)]
*  that's coming is how these models are gonna help us [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4718.26s)]
*  drive breakthroughs in math, physics, chemistry. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4721.9s)]
*  So this is from, I believe, Anthropic. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4726.62s)]
*  This is the prediction on when disciplines will be solved. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4729.82s)]
*  So pure mathematics being solved by 2028. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4734.18s)]
*  This means all of the unsolved math challenges out there [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4738.1s)]
*  getting solved by AI. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4741.900000000001s)]
*  Let's move down. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4743.22s)]
*  Computational chemistry by March of 29. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4744.06s)]
*  Medicinal chemistry leading to candidate molecules [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4747.42s)]
*  by October, 2029. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4750.5s)]
*  Material sciences being solved by 2030. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4752.42s)]
*  This means you're able to say, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4755.02s)]
*  I need a material that has these thermal properties, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4756.42s)]
*  these cost properties. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4761.06s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4765.34s)]
*  Cell biology, core pathways by May, 2030. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4766.18s)]
*  And climate earth modeling systems by 2033. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4770.82s)]
*  This is the non-linear inflection that just explodes [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4774.5s)]
*  all of our expectations about the future. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4779.38s)]
*  Look at that little note where it says [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4781.46s)]
*  most diseaseable curable in two and a half years. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4783.06s)]
*  Right? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4788.22s)]
*  That vertical line. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4789.06s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4790.42s)]
*  This is what we saw, Demisys Abyss state. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4792.219999999999s)]
*  They were gonna have all diseases cured [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4795.259999999999s)]
*  within the next decade. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4798.0199999999995s)]
*  I'd like to see in say pure mathematics or computation, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4799.66s)]
*  I'd like to see which breakthroughs they expect to achieve. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4803.299999999999s)]
*  Cause I'd like to see the discipline is solved, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4806.46s)]
*  quote unquote. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4808.46s)]
*  But I'd like to see what specific milestones [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4809.379999999999s)]
*  they're expecting to hit there. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4812.099999999999s)]
*  So anyway, we can worry about that some other time, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4813.98s)]
*  but this is amazing overall. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4816.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is where we desperately need Richard Socher [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4818.42s)]
*  as a guest cause he's mapped out the timelines. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4820.82s)]
*  It'd be great to get his opinion on whether these timelines [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4823.900000000001s)]
*  are accurate or not. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4825.900000000001s)]
*  Cause they're mostly gated by simulation modeling [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4827.3s)]
*  and synthetic data. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4830.18s)]
*  And that varies by different discipline, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4832.42s)]
*  but we've known that quantum computing is really, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4834.38s)]
*  really important for material science [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4836.66s)]
*  and for chemical reaction simulation, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4840.3s)]
*  which is the full cell simulator. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4843.42s)]
*  So the timeline and the technology [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4845.5s)]
*  is probably somewhat predictable now. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4848.1s)]
*  We need to get his opinion. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4850.7s)]
*  This is why I love getting on this podcast [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4851.54s)]
*  with both of you guys to really consider [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4854.02s)]
*  what's just happened this past week. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4856.54s)]
*  And you really do help me contextualize it. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4858.78s)]
*  And if everybody listening here, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4862.1s)]
*  I hope you're enjoying this cause Dave and Salim and I [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4863.38s)]
*  are pouring our hearts into this. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4866.22s)]
*  We're making this our priority every week to really [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4868.02s)]
*  deliver to you what we've seen, what it means. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4870.9s)]
*  So please join us in moonshots as we move this forward. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4873.78s)]
*  And as we do every week, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4877.219999999999s)]
*  let's talk a little bit about crypto and Bitcoin. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4878.5s)]
*  This was a big one. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4881.34s)]
*  Bitcoin surpasses Amazon and Google's market cap. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4882.219999999999s)]
*  It's been a big week for Bitcoin as well. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4886.3s)]
*  Salim, are you happy? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4889.3s)]
*  Getting happier by the day as the thing goes. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4892.46s)]
*  For me, this is the definition of democratization [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4897.7s)]
*  cause every single individual in the world [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4900.98s)]
*  can own Bitcoin. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4904.66s)]
*  And it's very, very hard to own say gold, right? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4906.0599999999995s)]
*  And so this is, I think, a huge trend in the right direction. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4909.179999999999s)]
*  And we could have a whole dedicated episode [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4914.58s)]
*  just on the impact of this on fiat currencies. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4917.34s)]
*  That might be with Jeff Booth as a guest [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4919.82s)]
*  and just talk through what are the implications [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4922.34s)]
*  for how we've been doing things for 50 years [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4924.0599999999995s)]
*  with fiat currencies having enormous stress. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4926.78s)]
*  The struggle in the Congress to pass a bill [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4930.86s)]
*  that's just gonna blow the debt open. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4934.7s)]
*  And so there's some big implications for all of this. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4936.7s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see Bitcoin surpass Microsoft as well. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4939.98s)]
*  It's got a while to go for beating out gold, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4943.7s)]
*  but it will get there as well. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4946.42s)]
*  And of course, this week we saw a surge, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4948.219999999999s)]
*  Bitcoin surpassing $110,000, setting all new time highs. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4951.5s)]
*  Just an extraordinary time to be alive, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4956.94s)]
*  as we say every single time. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4959.7s)]
*  You know, we talk about the value of markets, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4961.5s)]
*  $50 billion of Bitcoin gets traded every day. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4963.86s)]
*  That's the staggering number. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4969.62s)]
*  I mean, it's incredible. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4971.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I know one person is very happy [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4973.099999999999s)]
*  and that's Mike Seller. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4975.7s)]
*  You know, I haven't seen MicroStrategy stock [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4977.3s)]
*  continuing to peak at the same time [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4980.86s)]
*  that Bitcoin's been going up. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4982.9s)]
*  That's interesting if it's dislocated [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4984.099999999999s)]
*  from Bitcoin in some fashion, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4986.26s)]
*  but that's a different conversation. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4987.46s)]
*  Thank you everybody for joining us. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=4989.860000000001s)]

*  All right guys, can't wait to see [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5016.1s)]
*  what else is gonna happen next week. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5017.86s)]
*  So before we sign off, Peter, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5020.099999999999s)]
*  I just wanted to throw out a thank you [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5021.299999999999s)]
*  for inventing this podcast. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5022.38s)]
*  It's getting far, far more views [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5024.219999999999s)]
*  than I ever would have guessed. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5025.9s)]
*  And for me, it's been life-changing [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5027.099999999999s)]
*  in that this is so much more efficient a way [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5029.179999999999s)]
*  to reach out to people than one-on-one meetings, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5031.98s)]
*  getting on stage, you know, which I do a lot of anyway, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5035.339999999999s)]
*  but this has just been life-changing for me. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5037.86s)]

*  on the demarcation, but the tech insights coming [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiR1z46cLR8&t=5053.139999999999s)]
