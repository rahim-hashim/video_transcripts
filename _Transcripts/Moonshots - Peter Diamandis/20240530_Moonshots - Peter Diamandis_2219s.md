# Managing Risk to Build a Moonshot Venture w/ Marc Lore & Austin Russell | EP #103
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY)
*  Getting to 99% is actually relatively easy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=0.0s)]
*  It's all about that last 1%. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2.88s)]
*  You're faced with these tough decisions all the time [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=5.24s)]
*  where you're getting new information in every day [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=7.2s)]
*  and you have to remain totally objective. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Were there times in every venture where it almost failed? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=12.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=16.94s)]
*  When you're going for a moonshot, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=21.34s)]
*  you've got to be hit with a lot of skepticism. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=22.88s)]
*  You're asking people the question, why? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Why doesn't this work? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Why doesn't that make sense? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  And if you're not getting good answers back, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=29.4s)]
*  if you're like, hmm, I'm not convinced, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  so you didn't convince me why this thesis doesn't work, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  then you know you've got something. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=37.32s)]
*  The guts it takes to actually stop and say, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=38.48s)]
*  no, no, no, the data says we have to go here [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=43.68s)]
*  and reverse, reinvest, that's hard to do. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=47.04s)]
*  When you can create economic value, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=51.36s)]
*  you can do good for the world at the same time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=54.04s)]
*  It's about that impact that you're having. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=56.2s)]
*  Where did you both fly in from? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=60.28s)]
*  You just landed from where? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=62.08s)]
*  I just landed, yeah, I was just with the NVIDIA leadership [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=64.2s)]
*  over at the GTC up in the Bay Area, actually, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=68.48s)]
*  and then here and then going off to Florida. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=70.6s)]
*  Awesome, and mark yourself? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=73.28s)]
*  New York. New York, yeah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=74.96s)]
*  So I've really gotten to know you guys [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=76.56s)]
*  just over the last couple of years [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=80.5s)]
*  and so grateful to have you here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=81.96s)]
*  And your journeys epitomize resilience and risk. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=84.88s)]
*  And so what I'd love to do is just begin [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  so everybody can understand in the essence of your story, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=92.64s)]
*  then I'll go into some of the key questions. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  So Mark, would you recount your entrepreneurial journey [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=97.92s)]
*  real quick to get to wonder and where you are now [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=101.84s)]
*  and congratulations on $700 million raise last week, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  I think, amazing, extraordinary. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=108.6s)]
*  So diapers.com, jet.com, wonder, please. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=112.4s)]
*  Please. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=119.28s)]
*  Yeah, diapers.com and jet.com were e-commerce companies. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=121.0s)]
*  So I basically started diapers.com back in 2004-ish, five, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  2005, and it was basically a website for new parents [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=132.6s)]
*  to buy everything for their baby [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=137.06s)]
*  and then eventually everything for their pet [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  and then eventually everything [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=140.36s)]
*  and sold that to Amazon in 2011. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  Worked inside Amazon for a couple of years [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  and then started another e-commerce company called jet.com [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=146.28s)]
*  and then two years later Walmart bought that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=149.24s)]
*  How much? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=152.44000000000003s)]
*  3.3 billion. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=153.52s)]
*  Not bad. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  Two years later, you heard that part. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=157.12s)]
*  The exception, not the rule. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=159.8s)]
*  And then went in it and became the CEO of Walmart e-commerce [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  for about four plus years and then yeah, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=165.12s)]
*  then started Wonder. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  And you happen to own a sports team or something like that? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=168.68s)]
*  Minnesota Timberwolves. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, pretty amazing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=173.0s)]
*  And yeah, I guess who just came in? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  Eric Schmidt came in with you on that recently, didn't he? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=178.56s)]
*  I can't confirm or deny. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=181.4s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=182.96s)]
*  And Wonder does what? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=186.12s)]
*  Because we'll come back to that in a little bit. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=188.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think the best way to explain it [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=190.0s)]
*  is we're creating this super app for me all the time [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=191.52s)]
*  but it's a next generation of food delivery. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=193.96s)]
*  It's completely vertically integrated. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=196.52s)]
*  Just like a normal delivery aggregator [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=199.1s)]
*  that does the delivery and sells the food via an app, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  we have that but we also own all the restaurants [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  on the platform and we've invested hundreds of millions [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=205.5s)]
*  in food science and culinary engineering [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  to be able to cook 30 different cuisines [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  out of a 2,800 square foot kitchen [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=213.89999999999998s)]
*  with only three pieces of electric cooking equipment. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=215.54s)]
*  There's no hoods, there's no gas, no open flames, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=217.54s)]
*  no waste, very lightly skilled, lightly trained labor. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=220.33999999999997s)]
*  So we're able to pump out an extraordinary amount of volume [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=224.17999999999998s)]
*  in a small space we can locate very close to the customer. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=226.62s)]
*  We don't deliver more than six minutes in the city [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=230.46s)]
*  from the physical location and we can deliver very fast [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  hot food, really high quality. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=235.86s)]
*  You can order multiple restaurants from a single checkout [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=237.68s)]
*  and we have everything from fast, fine food [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=241.74s)]
*  like steakhouse, Jose Andreas, Michael Simon, Mark Murphy [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=244.66s)]
*  and we have barbecue, burgers, Chinese, Japanese, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  Mexican, Italian, basically anything you could want [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  at a single location and it's got a little sit down [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=255.38000000000002s)]
*  but mostly pick up and delivery. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=258.34000000000003s)]
*  So, remember we talked about the 60s of exponentials, right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=260.04s)]
*  He's basically digitized and dematerialized, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  demonetizing and democratizing all those restaurants [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=266.94s)]
*  into a convenient venue. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=269.74s)]
*  And we'll come back to that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=273.7s)]
*  Thank you for that quick summary. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't think you've ever done it that quickly. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=276.5s)]
*  Let's chat about your life experience here, Austin. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=279.82s)]
*  I just heard backstage that you were a competitor [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=284.54s)]
*  or one of our early XPrizes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=287.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's funny. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=289.82s)]
*  I mean, going back, I think, what? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=291.72s)]
*  Back when I was like 16, 17, I mean, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=294.48s)]
*  I remember the XPrize was like an inspiration there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=296.66s)]
*  Which XPrize was it? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=298.58s)]
*  Yeah, this was actually the Tri-Quarter there too. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=300.74s)]
*  That was, yeah, there was like an OG. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=302.86s)]
*  I think there's still some like OG video of me [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=304.38s)]
*  from like 10 years ago. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=307.86s)]
*  I was like trying to be like a team lead [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=308.82s)]
*  for the Tri-Quarter. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=310.82s)]
*  But yeah, there's amazing stuff that you guys have. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=314.1s)]
*  And then, obviously, later on, I ended up building LuminR. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=317.74s)]
*  What does LuminR do? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=320.86s)]
*  Yeah, so LuminR, we create these laser sensing systems, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  a LIDAR and an AI software for major automakers [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=326.46s)]
*  to be able to enable next generation safety systems [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  and autonomous driving capabilities on production cars. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=332.1s)]
*  So, whole idea is basically, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=335.06s)]
*  there's a lot of companies that have been trying to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=339.62s)]
*  replace drivers with like fully driverless vehicles, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=341.7s)]
*  RoboTax, anything. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=344.26s)]
*  The whole goal we've had is, you know, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=345.38s)]
*  enhance drivers, you know, increase the capabilities, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=346.82s)]
*  and ultimately be able to create sort of the uncrashable car, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=349.46s)]
*  you know, so to say, by enabling, you know, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=353.38s)]
*  when the car senses that if you're gonna get into [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=356.5s)]
*  a collision scenario, you know, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=358.58s)]
*  take over the braking system, take over steering wheel, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=360.56s)]
*  get you out of that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=362.62s)]
*  And that's enabled by this breakthrough LIDAR technology [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=363.46s)]
*  that we created and the software that automakers [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=366.98s)]
*  have really started adopting in mass. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=370.34s)]
*  Now, LIDAR, I think I remember it's like laser imaging radar [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=372.73999999999995s)]
*  type of, is that what it roughly means? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=376.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, basically it's, you know, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=378.97999999999996s)]
*  using these custom lasers we build to measure [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  the exact distance to different objects [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=383.62s)]
*  out in the field of view. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=385.46s)]
*  I remember when the first Google autonomous car came out, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=386.46s)]
*  it had a Velodyne LIDAR on the roof [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=389.05999999999995s)]
*  that was a spinning thing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  It cost about $150,000 and weighed like, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=394.02s)]
*  it was like coffee can size. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  What does one of your LIDARs cost now? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=400.7s)]
*  Or look like now? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=402.82s)]
*  No, no, it's a great question because, you know, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=404.1s)]
*  it's funny, I mean, I'm sure you guys have all seen [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=406.26s)]
*  like the autonomous test cars and other things [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=407.94s)]
*  that are out there. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=409.74s)]
*  And this is a huge problem from a cost [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=410.66s)]
*  and economic standpoint. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=412.54s)]
*  You know, they've historically been like this huge roof racks [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=414.3s)]
*  full of sensor and a supercomputer in the trunk [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=416.32s)]
*  that's required to run the thing. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=418.22s)]
*  So the whole point of what we were doing is creating, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  you know, something from the ground up, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=422.86s)]
*  from the chip level up that could have [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=424.1s)]
*  significantly improved performance [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=425.64s)]
*  and get the cost down from $1,000 [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=426.86s)]
*  down to under, I'm sorry, from $100,000 [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=429.6s)]
*  down to under $1,000. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=431.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what we did. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, basically we've sort of transformed that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=434.86s)]
*  from those, you know, kind of tuckie fried chicken, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  you know, bucket looking things to, you know, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=439.88000000000005s)]
*  a seamlessly integrated, you know, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=442.24s)]
*  sensor on production cars. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=443.58000000000004s)]
*  And now that's getting to go out in amazing brands like, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=445.5s)]
*  you know, ever ranging from Volvo to Mercedes to beyond. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=448.16s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=451.48s)]
*  And congrats to both of you for your extraordinary success [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=453.72s)]
*  on these. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=458.04s)]
*  I wanna talk about an underlying theme [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=459.56s)]
*  that I spoke to you both of you about here, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=462.84s)]
*  which is when you're going for a moonshot, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=465.84s)]
*  whether it's building Luminar [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=469.36s)]
*  or building your multiple companies, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=471.96s)]
*  Mark and Tulosa, which is your vision [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=474.92s)]
*  of a city of the future, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=478.52s)]
*  you've gotta be hit with a lot of skepticism. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=480.4s)]
*  Like you're crazy for a 20 year old [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=484.72s)]
*  or for somebody who's, you know, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=488.12s)]
*  not had restaurant experience. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=492.56s)]
*  And so can you talk one second, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=495.68s)]
*  and name this theme after our conversation, Mark, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=498.0s)]
*  embracing risk and resilience in moonshot ventures. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=501.64000000000004s)]
*  I think that's probably one of the most important elements [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=505.12s)]
*  we can talk about here. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=507.76000000000005s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=509.56s)]
*  I mean, first, I think it starts with having an AK. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=511.08000000000004s)]
*  I think I've been in e-commerce a long time. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=514.24s)]
*  I sort of know too much. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=517.28s)]
*  It's hard to have that clean blank slate [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=518.7199999999999s)]
*  to rethink a completely new vision. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=520.8399999999999s)]
*  You kind of know too much and your brain gets programmed [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=523.4s)]
*  to think a certain way. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  And so when people bring me e-commerce ideas [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=527.56s)]
*  after a really hard time, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=530.0s)]
*  I can point out why it's not gonna work [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  and see it very clearly. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  It's hard to have that clean slate to rethink [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=534.24s)]
*  without any information. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=536.8s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  entrepreneurs do really well, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  is when you don't know, and it's true, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=540.4s)]
*  you didn't know anything about the restaurant industry [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=541.84s)]
*  specifically, but can rethink from a clean slate [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  what might a step change look like, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=547.88s)]
*  and then really think about that vision [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=550.48s)]
*  and then do all the things to work backwards [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=552.76s)]
*  from that vision and then start knocking down [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=555.32s)]
*  all the barriers along the way. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=557.72s)]
*  But you have to have that naivete to sort of rethink. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=558.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if... [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=563.2s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=564.6s)]
*  Same way, right? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=566.24s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=567.32s)]
*  I mean, you weren't in the automotive industry. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  You weren't in the restaurant business. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  But the reality is most disruptions in industries [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=571.8399999999999s)]
*  occur from people who are not in the industry. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=574.24s)]
*  In fact, I know very few companies that have gone [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=576.64s)]
*  from one generation of technology [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=580.0s)]
*  to lead the next generation of technology. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=582.36s)]
*  I don't think anybody. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=584.8s)]
*  And so, what's your advice for entrepreneurs [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  to embrace that kind of... [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=592.68s)]
*  I mean, when people tell them you're crazy, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=595.24s)]
*  you have no background, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=597.0799999999999s)]
*  how did you develop sufficient confidence in yourself? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=599.2800000000001s)]
*  By the way, we did see this as well with Elon [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=603.72s)]
*  had no rocket business, no car business before. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just starting with something simple [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  like diapers, for example. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=610.0s)]
*  So, when started diapers.com, the thinking was, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=611.2800000000001s)]
*  I had a baby at the time, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=615.4000000000001s)]
*  and you couldn't get diapers delivered to your door [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=616.9200000000001s)]
*  at normal prices. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  If you went online to Amazon, whatever, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=621.2800000000001s)]
*  they were like $10 more a box. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=622.7600000000001s)]
*  And I just thought that was strange. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=624.8800000000001s)]
*  It makes like parents are busy, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=626.92s)]
*  I want to have diapers delivered. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  And so, when I started asking people and said, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=631.56s)]
*  I want to start an e-commerce company [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=633.92s)]
*  where we deliver diapers overnight to people [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  at Walmart prices. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=638.12s)]
*  That was sort of the original vision. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=639.4799999999999s)]
*  And people in the industry said, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  that's not gonna work, that's crazy, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=643.2399999999999s)]
*  it's too heavy, it's too expensive to ship, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  it's already a loss leader in Walmart, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=647.76s)]
*  now it's gonna be a bigger loss leader, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=650.04s)]
*  the math doesn't work. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=651.3599999999999s)]
*  And so, everyone just kind of ruled it out. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=652.56s)]
*  Procter & Gamble and Kimberly Clark, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=654.4s)]
*  the diaper manufacturers, wouldn't sell us diapers [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=655.88s)]
*  for years because they kept saying, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=658.52s)]
*  it's never gonna work, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=660.64s)]
*  so we don't want to be caught up in this [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=661.8s)]
*  and selling you that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  But, to answer your question, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=664.6s)]
*  you ask all the people in the industry questions, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=666.96s)]
*  and you keep questioning and see if they've got [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=670.6s)]
*  an answer to the sort of original thesis. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=673.96s)]
*  And the thesis was, yes, it's a loss leader, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=677.32s)]
*  and it's gonna be a bigger loss leader, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=680.28s)]
*  but you also have many more products online [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=681.84s)]
*  to monetize the loss over. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=684.1999999999999s)]
*  And when you start hitting people and say, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=687.24s)]
*  yeah, I know it's a loss, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=688.7199999999999s)]
*  but there's a reason why it's a loss for Walmart, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=689.92s)]
*  it drives traffic and they buy everything else. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  So what if we use it as a loss, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=694.12s)]
*  a bigger loss albeit, to sell them everything online? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  There's millions of products we can sell them online. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=698.68s)]
*  For anyone who's there to buy diapers, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=701.76s)]
*  they're likely needing the other things as well. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and buy everything, and now, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  it's pretty commonplace now that online, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=706.6s)]
*  people will sell diapers at a huge loss [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  because it's a great way to attract [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=711.36s)]
*  and retain new parents, which are big spenders online, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=713.36s)]
*  and all the math works out. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=716.88s)]
*  But you're asking people the question, why? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=719.08s)]
*  Why doesn't this work? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=722.32s)]
*  Why doesn't that make sense? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=723.36s)]
*  And if you're not getting good answers back, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=724.6s)]
*  if you're like, hmm, I'm not convinced, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=726.48s)]
*  so you didn't convince me why this thesis doesn't work, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  then you know you've got something. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=732.64s)]
*  So it's good to have your vision. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=733.88s)]
*  You have to stand by your conviction, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=736.28s)]
*  and then question, question, question, question. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=737.44s)]
*  And not fool yourself as well. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=739.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=742.08s)]
*  Austin, I know you're a first investor. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=743.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=749.52s)]
*  It's, no, I mean, it's an amazing journey. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=750.36s)]
*  Because what's funny, and what's even true [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  in the early stages of what we had to do, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=757.7199999999999s)]
*  is that it's that same kind of situation where when you try [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=760.36s)]
*  to disrupt something. How old were you [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  when you started Luminar? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=764.04s)]
*  You know, I was what, like 16, turning 17 at the time. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=765.36s)]
*  So, you know, who's a... [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=768.24s)]
*  And your vision was what? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=770.12s)]
*  What did you say when you like, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=771.68s)]
*  did you have a PowerPoint deck? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=773.8s)]
*  More like a lab. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=776.8s)]
*  More of a lab. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=778.16s)]
*  Yeah, you know, than a PowerPoint deck. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=779.0s)]
*  Hardware, talk, bullshit, walk. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=781.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, exactly. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=783.64s)]
*  It's much easier to create the PowerPoint [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=785.8s)]
*  than it is to do it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=787.64s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=788.56s)]
*  But yeah, no, it's the same exact kind of situation there, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=790.28s)]
*  too, where you have all the naysayers, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=793.3199999999999s)]
*  you have the folks that like, you know, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=796.8s)]
*  there's no way you're gonna do this much less like, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=798.16s)]
*  as a 16, 17 year old, like trying to create [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=800.16s)]
*  some new LIDAR system to like, you know, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=802.28s)]
*  beat out the Googles and Apples and every major automaker [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=805.24s)]
*  into developing a technology. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=808.12s)]
*  So, you have to bet on yourself. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=809.7199999999999s)]
*  Obviously, you have to be very well researched [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  and really know what you're talking about [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=813.0799999999999s)]
*  and have the conviction to do it. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=814.68s)]
*  But, you know, it's, yeah, it's the same kind of situation. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=815.68s)]
*  And you encounter those same kind of cycles [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=819.28s)]
*  all throughout the journey. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=820.8399999999999s)]
*  That's not something that's even just necessarily unique. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=821.68s)]
*  Not once and done. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=823.6s)]
*  It's just in very different forms, right? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  And so, I get, do you, are you constantly [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  just like rechecking your premises [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=831.68s)]
*  and heading out with greater conviction [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=834.72s)]
*  and finding evidence to support yourself? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=836.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=839.56s)]
*  And that's where, you know, we deal with [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=841.12s)]
*  the same kind of stuff today there. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=842.8s)]
*  And I think in this case, like for example, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=843.9599999999999s)]
*  for the broader, you know, autonomous vehicle industry, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=846.56s)]
*  it's sort of gone through this whole transition, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=849.0s)]
*  you know, in that broader, like in this case now, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=853.16s)]
*  the Gartner cycle, you know, you could call it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=856.48s)]
*  It's, you know, gone up, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=858.48s)]
*  you have the peak of inflated expectations. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=860.68s)]
*  It's probably at the bottom of the trough [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=862.8s)]
*  of disillusionment phase [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=864.28s)]
*  and now like onto the enlightenment phase. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=865.6s)]
*  And that's, you know, probably rightfully justified [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=868.08s)]
*  because, you know, most of the stuff [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=871.08s)]
*  in the broader autonomous vehicle industry [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=872.12s)]
*  of these promise of all these self-driving cars, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=873.72s)]
*  you know, taking over cities, you know, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=876.32s)]
*  doing everything didn't quite materialize, right? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=878.0s)]
*  Do you remember our conversation with Elon? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=881.36s)]
*  Yes, yes, I do. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=883.44s)]
*  So we're at a friend's birthday party and Elon's there [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=885.28s)]
*  and Austin is there and I pull Elon over, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=888.52s)]
*  I say, I pulled Austin over, I said, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=891.52s)]
*  okay, Elon meet Austin, Austin meet Elon, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=893.64s)]
*  Austin makes LIDAR. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=897.12s)]
*  And Elon's like, nope, he's, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=898.88s)]
*  if a human driver can see with visual eyes only, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=901.3199999999999s)]
*  then autonomous cars only need visual eyes. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=905.04s)]
*  He's very convinced. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=907.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, and I think that [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=909.64s)]
*  absolutely unquestionably was the, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=912.52s)]
*  what he was right on was in 2015 [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=915.64s)]
*  when he had to make the decision for that around like, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  hey, what kind of systems are you using? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=920.9200000000001s)]
*  What are you gonna do? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=922.4s)]
*  Use that $100,000 like spinning bucket [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=923.24s)]
*  and put it on every car? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=926.04s)]
*  Like that's not gonna happen. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=926.96s)]
*  So I think, you know, part of the whole point is, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=928.6800000000001s)]
*  is that now for the first time, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=930.9200000000001s)]
*  there actually is a solution that can enable [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=933.36s)]
*  the next generation of safety and autonomy. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=935.28s)]
*  And the reality is, is that like, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=937.12s)]
*  our bet is, is that it was gonna be like way more difficult [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=938.6s)]
*  than what people were anticipating to do this. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=941.12s)]
*  And that, you know, the existing systems [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=943.28s)]
*  were just not gonna be there enough to solve the problem. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=945.44s)]
*  And that's part of the whole point is with the LIDAR, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=947.64s)]
*  it's not just guessing what's going on. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=949.8s)]
*  You actually know with ground truth exactly where it is. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=951.36s)]
*  Because for, you know, safety systems [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=954.2s)]
*  and self-driving and all that, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=956.72s)]
*  it's not about the 99%, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=957.72s)]
*  getting to 99% is actually relatively easy. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=959.64s)]
*  It's all about that last 1%. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=961.84s)]
*  You know, it's, you can't run over one of the every 100 people [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=964.24s)]
*  that you see, for example. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=967.36s)]
*  So, you know, it's like a, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=968.64s)]
*  it's very, very real, folks. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=970.36s)]
*  So, you know, yeah, breakthrough. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=971.96s)]
*  So, that's what it takes. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  Everybody wanna take a short break from our episode [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=978.0s)]
*  to talk about a company that's very important to me [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=979.9200000000001s)]
*  and could actually save your life [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=982.96s)]
*  or the life of someone that you love. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=985.2s)]
*  Company is called Fountain Life. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=988.88s)]

*  you go to the physician in the emergency room [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1003.28s)]

*  You could have, you sold your companies, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1119.3s)]
*  you had, what is that, many, many desks, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1121.8600000000001s)]
*  many commas in the bank worth of capital for your successes. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1127.66s)]
*  You could have sat back. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1131.4s)]
*  You didn't. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1133.8s)]
*  What was the creative process of getting to wonder? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1135.3s)]
*  Were you just a junkie about creating something new? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1139.66s)]
*  What was it that lit you on fire to go in, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1143.1399999999999s)]
*  and why that industry? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1146.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think, like most entrepreneurs, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1148.22s)]
*  you sort of can't, you love to build. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1150.02s)]
*  I love to build stuff from nothing. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1152.46s)]
*  But then you see a problem, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  and you think you have maybe a possible solution to it, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  and then it just starts to build and build and build, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1159.98s)]
*  and then it has to be. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1162.54s)]
*  So what was the problem that you saw? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1163.7s)]
*  I think, well, I was watching food delivery explode [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1165.78s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1167.8s)]
*  We're 100 billion now in food delivery in the U.S. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1168.6399999999999s)]
*  expected to go to 500 billion by 2036. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1170.84s)]
*  Was this during COVID? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1173.32s)]
*  Was it the situation before? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1174.8s)]
*  Before COVID. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1176.32s)]
*  Before COVID. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1177.1599999999999s)]
*  And was just watching what was happening in food delivery. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1178.0s)]
*  People were paying a incredible premium for convenience, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1181.96s)]
*  and they were tolerating slow delivery, cold food, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1185.3s)]
*  inaccurate orders, bad customer service. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1189.12s)]
*  Like it just didn't feel like that was the future. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1191.0s)]
*  It reminded me of the early days of e-commerce [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1193.52s)]
*  where you had marketplaces and things, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1195.36s)]
*  and then Amazon comes along with this [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1196.84s)]
*  vertically integrated first party, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1199.1599999999999s)]
*  elevated customer experience. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1200.74s)]
*  I just felt like that was the next generation [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1202.1599999999999s)]
*  of food delivery. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1205.48s)]
*  Somebody was gonna come and vertically integrate [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1206.32s)]
*  and take the value proposition to a whole other level [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1208.3999999999999s)]
*  and be able to deliver food fast, hot, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1210.9599999999998s)]
*  with great customer service, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1212.8799999999999s)]
*  and all the things that weren't happening. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1214.4599999999998s)]
*  And that was through the original thinking, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1216.36s)]
*  but that's the way the idea started. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1217.78s)]
*  Then it was- [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1219.32s)]
*  But let's talk about what your original idea there, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1220.24s)]
*  because you did a major pivot, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1223.6799999999998s)]
*  which is, I wanna talk about that pivot as well. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1225.6s)]
*  So your original idea was you were gonna build [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1228.1599999999999s)]
*  these kitchens on wheels, right? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1231.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1233.8s)]
*  The vision was to vertically integrate [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  and take the customer value prop to a whole other level. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1237.76s)]
*  And the thinking was, why do we cook and then deliver? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1240.48s)]
*  What if we delivered then cooked? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1243.6599999999999s)]
*  And so we basically, in the back of a Mercedes Sprinter van, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1246.1599999999999s)]
*  had one piece of technology, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1250.22s)]
*  and we were able to cook really high quality food, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  really fast under 10 minutes, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1255.76s)]
*  where the driver who drove there was actually able to cook [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1257.68s)]
*  because it was so simple. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1260.5600000000002s)]
*  And that was the original thinking, and it worked. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1262.0s)]
*  Customers absolutely loved it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1264.96s)]
*  You rolled this out wearing New Jersey, was it? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1267.16s)]
*  In New Jersey suburbs, yeah. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1268.64s)]
*  We had 400 trucks on the road. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1269.72s)]
*  Customer scores, repeat rates were incredible. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1272.16s)]
*  Customers loved it. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1274.3200000000002s)]
*  We got to unit economic positive. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1276.4s)]
*  Things were going really well. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1278.52s)]
*  But. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1280.52s)]
*  But, and this is where the but comes in, yeah. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  Wasn't the CEO at the time, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1286.16s)]
*  so I was the executive chairman. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1287.5600000000002s)]
*  But we had tested doing the same thing [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1289.88s)]
*  out of a brick and mortar, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1292.4s)]
*  with a couple of seats in the front, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1294.0800000000002s)]
*  and pick up and delivery. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1296.0400000000002s)]
*  And the thinking was, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1297.44s)]
*  if we set a really tight delivery radius, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1298.5600000000002s)]
*  can we get the same scores that we got on the trucks? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1300.3600000000001s)]
*  We also would be able to have multi-restaurant ordering, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1303.3000000000002s)]
*  which you couldn't do on the truck, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1305.76s)]
*  because each truck had one or two restaurants. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1306.76s)]
*  But if you get all 30 restaurants, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1309.02s)]
*  and you can get them all delivered together, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1310.3600000000001s)]
*  that was, on the customer side, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1312.72s)]
*  we proved that we can deliver it [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1314.58s)]
*  with the same quality as the truck, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1315.98s)]
*  if we keep the radius. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1318.1799999999998s)]
*  But we had the ability to scale. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1319.3799999999999s)]
*  It worked in urban, suburban, rural area, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1321.1399999999999s)]
*  the brick and mortar. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1323.02s)]
*  Trucks were really more of a suburban play. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1324.1s)]
*  And the unit economics were better, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1326.62s)]
*  because we were able to distribute [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1328.54s)]
*  the labor across many more orders. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1330.46s)]
*  So we were able to do a better job there. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1333.6999999999998s)]
*  What's interesting here, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1335.98s)]
*  what I'm hearing is, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1337.1s)]
*  the fact that you were testing along the way, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1338.58s)]
*  you were getting data, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1340.6999999999998s)]
*  it wasn't an opinion, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1342.1s)]
*  it was actually the numbers. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1343.5s)]
*  And you weren't trying to take this to scale, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1344.9s)]
*  you were doing this on unit economics, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1346.3s)]
*  and on a square kilometer basis. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1348.18s)]
*  Yeah, this is where risk comes into play though, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1351.78s)]
*  I think, because I like to say, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1353.62s)]
*  we were digging for silver when we found gold. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1355.1s)]
*  And as an entrepreneur, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1357.66s)]
*  you're faced with these tough decisions all the time, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1359.18s)]
*  where you're getting new information in every day, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1361.5s)]
*  and you have to remain totally objective. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1364.48s)]
*  And you can't get wed or hung up on [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1367.46s)]
*  what you told investors, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1370.26s)]
*  what you told customers, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1371.34s)]
*  what you told anyone, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1372.72s)]
*  if there's a better opportunity. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1374.76s)]
*  Can you guys reflect on that one second? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1376.52s)]
*  Let's hear it for that, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1379.44s)]
*  because the guts it takes to actually stop, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1380.6000000000001s)]
*  and say, no, no, no, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1384.8s)]
*  the data says we have to go here, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1387.08s)]
*  and reverse, reinvest, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1389.6000000000001s)]
*  that's hard to do. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1394.02s)]
*  Yeah, the CEO, and he'll say this, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1395.68s)]
*  he couldn't do it, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1397.5s)]
*  the trucks were working in his mind, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1398.64s)]
*  it was profitable, customers loved it, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1400.9s)]
*  and my recommendation was, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1403.22s)]
*  yeah, but this is so much better. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1405.66s)]
*  You were the principal owner, right? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1406.98s)]
*  Was it all your capital at this point? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1408.1000000000001s)]
*  No, we still had, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1410.02s)]
*  we said we had a significant amount of venture, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1410.8600000000001s)]
*  and at that point. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1412.5400000000002s)]
*  But you had enough capital of your own [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1414.5800000000002s)]
*  to be able to say, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1416.22s)]
*  no, we have to go this direction. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1417.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1418.8200000000002s)]
*  And that is so important, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1419.66s)]
*  not to get stuck in a local maxima. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1420.94s)]
*  When you see the evidence that just over the other hill, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1425.5800000000002s)]
*  there is something much better. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1428.68s)]
*  And to know that if you don't do it, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1431.04s)]
*  eventually you're gonna get disrupted by this better idea. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1432.76s)]
*  Everything you've done up to that point is a sunk cost, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1435.24s)]
*  you can't count it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1437.32s)]
*  Most people though, they just can't get over that it sunk. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1438.32s)]
*  Well, I already said this, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1441.28s)]
*  that doesn't mean anything. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1442.52s)]
*  From today forward, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1443.64s)]
*  what's the best investment you could possibly make [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1444.8s)]
*  with investors' money? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1447.72s)]
*  And it took a lot to basically say, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1449.04s)]
*  we're gonna take revenue to zero, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1451.3s)]
*  we're gonna stop the trucks, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1453.04s)]
*  we're gonna sell the trucks, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1454.1s)]
*  we're gonna take a loss on the trucks, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1454.96s)]
*  and we're gonna start over with brick and mortar. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1456.52s)]
*  And the investors got comfortable and bought into it, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1458.52s)]
*  but I think we're still skeptical. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1462.6s)]
*  This is going back 18 months ago. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1464.16s)]
*  And now, I mean, people don't even know how to say that. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1467.12s)]
*  Don't look back. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1471.44s)]
*  No, no. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1472.28s)]
*  Austin, have you had a similar experience at all? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1473.12s)]
*  Actually, yeah, it's funny. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1474.84s)]
*  We had a few that maybe not quite as dramatic [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1476.8s)]
*  in terms of pivot or anything for the business. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1480.66s)]
*  But I would say probably the main one was [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1483.06s)]
*  going back to the driverless vehicles [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1485.92s)]
*  versus enhancing the safety and the safety focus on that [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1489.68s)]
*  was a big thing of where, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1492.48s)]
*  like I said, pretty much, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1494.48s)]
*  what, three, four years ago, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1497.8400000000001s)]
*  it was actually, funnily enough, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1501.52s)]
*  considered extremely contrarian [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1502.8400000000001s)]
*  to try and do what we were doing [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1504.96s)]
*  to put our technology onto production vehicles. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1506.04s)]
*  It was almost unheard of to be able to try and do that. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1508.52s)]
*  And the thought process was that ride hailing [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1511.64s)]
*  and other things were the way that it was gonna go. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1514.04s)]
*  The Uber's this world we're gonna take over with. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1517.24s)]
*  There was a lot of confidence. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1520.08s)]
*  It was just a few years away. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1521.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it was a few years away. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1522.6399999999999s)]
*  And that was where really saying, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1523.68s)]
*  hey guys, we're gonna bet the company on this [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1526.56s)]
*  by really just going all in on the safety focus, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1528.68s)]
*  work on production vehicles. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1532.28s)]
*  Don't invest a ton in the driverless side. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1534.48s)]
*  And frankly, even more today, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1538.72s)]
*  I've actually, even more recently, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1540.6s)]
*  as we kind of focus in on cost [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1542.64s)]
*  and really drive that for, okay, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1545.04s)]
*  what are the things that aren't gonna drive [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1547.08s)]
*  those kind of near-term returns? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1549.0s)]
*  Is that even less so for the remaining stuff [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1550.4s)]
*  that we had on the autonomous vehicle side, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1554.28s)]
*  which saves a decent amount, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1555.6s)]
*  just really focus all in on how you improve safety, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1557.84s)]
*  how you improve systems with drivers. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1560.72s)]
*  And yeah, like I said, it was kind of radical at the time, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1563.44s)]
*  but I think step-by-step being proven right [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1565.88s)]
*  can soon be validated with these upcoming [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1570.12s)]
*  major vehicle launches that we have. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1572.6399999999999s)]
*  Mark, you able to talk about your financing publicly? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1575.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's publicly. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1578.08s)]
*  How much did you raise at what valuation? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1579.3999999999999s)]
*  We raised, we just completed a $700 million round, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1581.1999999999998s)]
*  safe note, it's not priced. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1585.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1587.08s)]
*  Yeah, and it basically converts in at IPO. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1587.9199999999998s)]
*  Not seven trillion. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1590.8s)]
*  Parts. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1591.84s)]
*  Yeah, we were just talking about that backstage, yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1592.6799999999998s)]
*  What, the $7 trillion raise? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1595.84s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1597.8799999999999s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1600.36s)]
*  Sam Altman sucked all the bravado out of the room. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1601.56s)]
*  He said he was gonna raise $7 trillion. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1605.6s)]
*  I tried to add AI at the end of Wonder, it didn't work. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1607.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1609.8s)]
*  It's funny, we were talking about it, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1612.52s)]
*  it went through for the early phases. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1613.36s)]
*  We also did a bunch of safe notes. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1615.1999999999998s)]
*  It's all about doubling down on yourself, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1617.08s)]
*  betting on yourself, that's the thing. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1618.7199999999998s)]
*  If you really believe what you're gonna do [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1620.3999999999999s)]
*  and it's gonna be successful and more valuable, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1622.56s)]
*  it's a really smart way to build that [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1624.6s)]
*  and to do it so you don't have to get hugely diluted [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1627.64s)]
*  at times where there's always cycles in the business [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1630.8000000000002s)]
*  and it's funny even through the 12 years [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1633.92s)]
*  I've had with Luminar, there's always cycles [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1636.96s)]

*  owning a huge stake in the company [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1650.88s)]

*  that ride along the journey with you. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1653.8000000000002s)]
*  Austin, last year this time, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1655.64s)]
*  you were in the back of the room. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1657.0400000000002s)]
*  I had Tony Robbins on stage here [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1658.2800000000002s)]
*  and you were on the verge of becoming [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1661.3200000000002s)]
*  the owner and chairman of Forbes. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1664.5600000000002s)]

*  and yeah, I'm not even sure if it was public at the time. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1670.72s)]
*  So that was a thing of where I had a vision [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1673.96s)]
*  for the whole next generation of capitalism [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1676.4s)]

*  in general out of that? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1683.88s)]
*  I know it was a wild roller coaster ride [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1685.8000000000002s)]
*  and I don't know, you said you'd be open to talk about it [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1688.96s)]
*  some but I don't know what is comfortable or not. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1691.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, I mean it's, and ultimately it passes [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1693.8000000000002s)]
*  at this point but it's relatively straightforward. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1697.5200000000002s)]
*  I mean, they had the vision around [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1699.7600000000002s)]
*  the next generation of capitalism [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1701.4s)]
*  but at the end of the day I think we signed up [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1702.72s)]
*  to sort of a fully funded deal for that there too [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1706.0s)]
*  with some partners but ultimately didn't end up [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1709.0800000000002s)]
*  delivering on the obligations that were had. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1713.92s)]

*  You take risks with these things [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1719.24s)]
*  but at the end of the day, yeah, I think [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1721.3200000000002s)]
*  what I'm absolutely still very much excited to see [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1725.8400000000001s)]
*  and what the whole, I would say, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1730.28s)]
*  origination of kind of that concept was [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1732.48s)]
*  all comes back to the Luminar and the journey [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1735.2s)]
*  that I've had personally through this [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1737.28s)]
*  of showing how when you can create economic value, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1739.6s)]
*  you can do good for the world at the same time [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1745.6799999999998s)]
*  and that's sort of what I mean [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1747.8s)]
*  by the whole next generation of capitalism [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1748.6399999999999s)]
*  is that being able to make an impact on the world [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1750.56s)]
*  and that's in the case of like Luminar for example, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1753.52s)]
*  we have this broad vision around saving as many as [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1756.32s)]
*  100 million lives and 100 trillion hours [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1759.6799999999998s)]

*  and that over the next 100 years [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1765.36s)]
*  and that's where everything that we do at Luminar [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1767.92s)]
*  rolls up to that vision because if we're able to solve [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1770.48s)]
*  for the majority of vehicle accidents in the industry, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1772.44s)]
*  that's the magnitude and level of impact that you have [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1775.1200000000001s)]
*  and of course, yeah, you can create [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1777.28s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars of value in that [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1779.48s)]
*  at the same time as you do that [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1781.4s)]
*  but it's about that impact that you're having [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1783.04s)]
*  and I think that's personally what's inspiring me [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1785.28s)]
*  and as Luminar is and always will be, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1788.52s)]
*  that's my passion and drive and what I spend the time on [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1792.8400000000001s)]
*  to be able to help realize that vision and make it happen. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1796.44s)]

*  the ability to accurately detect viruses and microbes [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1811.96s)]

*  the executing the vision, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1958.8s)]

*  I think early on, easy to raise money, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1980.32s)]

*  Later, it's easier to get great talent, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1984.8799999999999s)]
*  harder to raise money. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1986.56s)]
*  And then ultimately when you get more mature, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1987.4s)]
*  it's a mix of everything. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1991.16s)]
*  Were there times on every venture [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1993.0s)]
*  where it almost failed? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1995.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1997.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=1999.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2000.76s)]
*  You're doing something. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2002.5600000000002s)]
*  What kept you from failing [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2003.4s)]
*  in those almost failure moments? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2004.24s)]
*  I think, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2007.16s)]
*  I think just being relentless. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2011.52s)]
*  I think it is, at the end of the day, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2013.3600000000001s)]
*  it's being relentless. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2014.6000000000001s)]
*  You believe in the vision, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2016.0400000000002s)]
*  you believe in the model [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2017.64s)]
*  and you have to just put the hard work and time in [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2020.0800000000002s)]
*  and find a way. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2023.16s)]
*  And so it involves thinking about it 24 seven [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2024.08s)]
*  and trying to figure out there has to be a way. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2028.36s)]
*  This vision, it makes sense. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2031.28s)]
*  And it's usually the hard part though [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2034.3999999999999s)]
*  is always getting that balance between [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2038.84s)]
*  how much capital it's gonna take to realize the vision [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2041.76s)]
*  and whether that's gonna offer investors [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2045.36s)]
*  a good return relative to the risk. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2047.6399999999999s)]
*  And so either you have to reduce risk [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2049.4s)]
*  or increase the probability of getting there [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2051.44s)]
*  and getting that right balance right [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2053.52s)]
*  and just thinking about all the possible things you can do [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2054.7599999999998s)]
*  to either reduce risk or increase probability. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2057.72s)]
*  And many times, ironically, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2060.12s)]
*  the best way to increase the probability of getting there [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2062.08s)]
*  is actually to take risk. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2065.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2067.2s)]
*  And sometimes, not most times, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2068.04s)]
*  many times it's taking personal risk as well. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2070.36s)]
*  And that builds more conviction. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2074.04s)]
*  And because you're, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2076.68s)]
*  you basically jumped [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2078.04s)]
*  and you gotta build your parachute on the way down. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2079.36s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2081.16s)]
*  Same for you, Austin. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2083.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, absolutely. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2085.8s)]
*  I mean, there's times where throughout the early days [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2087.04s)]
*  of Luminar where we put everything on the line [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2091.12s)]
*  for to make sure and ensure the company's success. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2095.04s)]
*  And I think that's just where [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2097.04s)]
*  you have to have the conviction, obviously. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2099.52s)]
*  I mean, reality checked, of course, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2102.28s)]
*  but as is the case, like I said, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2104.4s)]
*  you go through the cycles there. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2106.52s)]
*  And it's so funny because [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2108.16s)]
*  it's like history repeats itself over and over again [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2114.52s)]
*  where you do the right things, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2117.7599999999998s)]
*  you have to go build out the systems, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2119.28s)]
*  do what you say, say what you do, prove it out, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2122.04s)]
*  get to that next step, do what you say, say what you do, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2124.92s)]
*  prove it out, get to that next step. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2126.72s)]
*  And in our case, it's this big launch [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2128.56s)]
*  that we have ahead there too [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2134.12s)]
*  for our first major global automaker. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2135.88s)]
*  And that's what we're really excited about there too. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2140.2s)]
*  Proving that out to show how, for example, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2142.9599999999996s)]
*  at a kind of industry level, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2145.9599999999996s)]
*  how the kinds of capabilities that can be realized [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2148.04s)]
*  and the benefits of autonomy are real, it can happen. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2152.0s)]
*  It actually can go into cars that you can buy. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2154.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not just some theoretical concept. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2157.64s)]
*  Those same kinds of principles, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2160.2s)]
*  obviously it's on a different scale now than it was [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2161.7999999999997s)]
*  in the early days. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2164.3999999999996s)]
*  But yeah, and you see the examples. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2165.24s)]
*  I've had some great lessons from other entrepreneurs [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2170.64s)]
*  throughout the years, everything mentioned when we said, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2174.3599999999997s)]
*  Elon back in the dam, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2180.6s)]
*  and Tesla has had their own very crazy moments [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2182.04s)]
*  along the way, for example, in our industry. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2187.68s)]
*  Pretty much everyone, every entrepreneur, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2190.68s)]
*  has some crazy story, right? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2193.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2194.7599999999998s)]
*  Just the way it is. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2195.8799999999997s)]
*  It's always just all crazy. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2196.8799999999997s)]
*  You haven't heard the ones who didn't succeed [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2198.6s)]
*  because they gave up along the way. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2201.08s)]
*  The passionate and persistent human mind. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2203.2s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2205.4s)]
*  for Mark Lohr and Austin Russell. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVYh4WWShY&t=2206.7599999999998s)]
