# AI Is Making More Millionaires Than Anything in History w/ Salim Ismail & Dave Blundin | EP #181
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ)
*  We may need to rewrite the whole paradigm, Peter, because what's happening now is another [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  double exponential on top of that with AI accelerating everything so quickly, including [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5.08s)]
*  path to revenue. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  There is a unicorns in half a year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  I really, really hope the young entrepreneurs coming up appreciate what a moment in time [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=13.76s)]
*  this is. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=18.22s)]
*  This is exponential thinking. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=19.22s)]
*  This is entrepreneurial thinking. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=20.42s)]
*  There is a bet to be made right now if you're an investor on where are you going to invest [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=21.98s)]
*  to ride this curve because it's not slowing down. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=27.459999999999997s)]
*  Is it real estate? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=31.22s)]
*  Is it data centers? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=32.22s)]
*  Is it chips? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=33.22s)]
*  Is it power? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=34.22s)]
*  Because all of these things are going to make somebody, hopefully somebody listening right [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=35.22s)]
*  now, huge amounts of wealth. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=40.9s)]
*  This is unstoppable meta trend. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=43.34s)]
*  Now that's the moonshot, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=45.86s)]
*  Hey everybody, Peter Diamandis here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=52.14s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots and our WTF Just Happened in Tech episode here with the extraordinary [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=54.940000000000005s)]
*  Salim Ismail and my partner Dave Blunden. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=61.14s)]
*  I'm still thinking the architect of AI. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=65.42s)]
*  The alchemist of AI. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=68.42s)]
*  Peter, you're the pope of hope. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=71.1s)]
*  Pope of hope, all right. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=74.66s)]
*  Well, hey, listen, a lot going on and excited. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=75.66s)]
*  I just want to do a shout out to our super fans out there who are just giving us incredible [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=78.7s)]
*  love for this episode every week that we do and we care deeply about it, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=84.2s)]
*  Our goal is to deliver to you the news that really matters, the news that's shaping our [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=89.2s)]
*  companies or entrepreneurial journeys, every aspect of our lives. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=93.4s)]
*  So please share this with your friends and family. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=98.08s)]
*  The goal is to give people a sense of optimism, a compelling, abundant future that's being [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=102.14s)]
*  driven by this technology. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=107.68s)]
*  It's not all dire crisis news network out there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=109.44s)]
*  Anyway, welcome. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  Dave, there were some incredible messages in last week's episode about how awesome you [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=114.56s)]
*  are and I don't think our fans know enough about you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=120.04s)]
*  So if you don't mind, I know a lot about you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=126.64s)]
*  I've been your roommate since our undergraduate days at MIT. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  But what is Link Exponential Ventures? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=132.84s)]
*  What do you do just so folks can really appreciate how awesome you truly are? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=137.08s)]
*  Well, we manage about a billion dollars of seed stage money here in Kendall Square right [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=141.12s)]
*  between MIT and Harvard. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=145.32s)]
*  But fundamentally what we do is when I graduated, immediately tried to start a company and everything [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=147.6s)]
*  is working against you at that age. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=154.4s)]
*  It's almost impossible even to get an apartment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=157.28s)]
*  You have no credit score. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  There's no funding at the time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  There were no incubators and accelerators. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=163.32s)]
*  And so I've spent a big chunk of my life actually now trying to identify everything that slows [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=165.48s)]
*  down a new founder, especially in today's day and age, almost all the deals are AI companies. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=170.16s)]
*  And we see many, many companies reaching multi-billion dollar valuations in two, three years. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=175.4s)]
*  So you've got very young teams, very fast timelines, and there's so much that we can do to help them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=181.08s)]
*  And so we started with office space and funding. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Then we added accounting. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=191.12s)]
*  We added big data. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=192.2s)]
*  A few weeks ago, we bought an apartment building. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=193.96s)]
*  So one of our observations was Mercure added from the day we invested at the seed stage to today. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=196.32s)]
*  It added 20 million dollars a week of value. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=202.76s)]
*  And we're like, OK, how much does it cost to buy this apartment building? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=206.08s)]
*  About six million bucks. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=208.96s)]
*  OK, buy it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=209.96s)]
*  Because if we can save a team like that even one week in their growth cycle, it pays for itself times five. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=211.2s)]
*  And so just doing everything we can at Link to accelerate these young, super smart AI teams. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=217.6s)]
*  And so funding is part of it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  Mentoring is part of it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=228.84s)]
*  And so on. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  And the returns have been extraordinary. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=230.72s)]
*  You're a unicorn incubator. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=232.76s)]
*  Unicorn incubator. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=234.72s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=235.52s)]
*  Hey, I'm curious, guys, what did you do for the Fourth of July? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=236.36s)]
*  Anybody explode anything? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  I went up to Vermont, tried to get away from AI as much as possible for a day or two. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=243.84s)]
*  It's hard to. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  Salim, how about you? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=248.56s)]
*  I sat in the garden with a glass of wine and a glazed look at mice. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  OK, well, I was in Montana building explosives. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  It was so great. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=257.6s)]
*  I had my two boys there and we were like taking apart M-80s and firecrackers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=258.36s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=263.24s)]
*  And separating out the gunpowder from the filler. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=264.0s)]
*  We had an arsenal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=268.0s)]
*  It was extraordinary. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  I remember when I was a kid, I could buy potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=270.36s)]
*  make my own gunpowder. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=274.68s)]
*  And then I remember buying potassium perchlorate. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=276.16s)]
*  Potassium perchlorate is great because it generates its own oxygen. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  And if you mix it with charcoal and sulfur, any reducing agent. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=282.88s)]
*  And I remember throwing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=287.64s)]
*  So there's a book called Poor Man's James Bond. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=290.2s)]
*  And they talk about, so you take like an old film canister. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=294.64s)]
*  You put an M-80 fuse, fill it with gunpowder, put it in body putty. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=298.76s)]
*  And I built that, threw it into my friend's pool to see like this splash. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=302.48s)]
*  And what occurs next taught me something in physics. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=308.08s)]
*  Liquids are not compressible. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=313.08s)]
*  That explosion literally cracked my friend's pool in half. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=315.64s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=319.88s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=320.4s)]
*  I'm sure you should be talking about some of this stuff publicly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, it's way past the 17th year. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=324.48s)]
*  The door firmer. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=325.92s)]
*  I'm not sure I didn't know that story after all. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=327.32s)]
*  But you cannot buy, you can't buy this stuff anymore. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  You can still buy, what we used to do is buy the SDs model rocket engines. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=333.2s)]
*  And then just crack them open and scrape out the insides. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=337.16s)]
*  Well, you can do that with fireworks too. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=339.36s)]
*  But I want to buy the pure chemicals and teach my boys how to be true. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  OK, let's move on. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=346.12s)]
*  I may need to find another podcast, you two. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=347.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=351.56s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=352.44s)]
*  Our first area, of course, AI supremacy and speed everywhere, always all at once. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=354.12s)]
*  Another crazy weekend AI. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=360.76s)]
*  Dave, tell us about this TechCrunch article here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=363.84s)]
*  Yeah, so 36 Unicorns. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  I really, really hope the young entrepreneurs coming up appreciate [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  what a moment in time this is. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  I love to tell the students that last year, there [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=375.84s)]
*  wasn't a single self-made billionaire under the age of 30 in America. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=379.04s)]
*  That was the first time in 15 years that that was true. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=384.0s)]
*  Prior to that, you had your Mark Zuckerbergs, then you had your Larry [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  Pages, and just a whole litany of internet young billionaires. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  But there's this huge dead spot over about a 15-year span. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=396.72s)]
*  And now we're in the biggest peak of my lifetime by far. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=400.88s)]
*  And you'll never see anything else like it again. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  But 36 Unicorns in half a year on this kind of accelerating rate. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=406.64s)]
*  And then a couple that we've invested in. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=411.68s)]
*  And then prior to this window, you also have Liquid AI and a bunch of others [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=413.68s)]
*  from the prior half year. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=417.08s)]
*  This is not normal. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=418.96s)]
*  This is the opportunity of a lifetime. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=420.76s)]
*  And the rate at which you need to move to keep up with it is just a full sprint. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  So the question is, is this thing you normal? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=428.32s)]
*  Because we're seeing this crazy valuation increase and speed to not just [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=432.04s)]
*  evaluation, but speed to revenue like never seen before. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=439.44s)]
*  Yeah, look at the next slide for the revenue view of it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=443.0s)]
*  So this is not normal, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  The timeline to profitability or to significant revenue is super, super short. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  That means you're stable. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  Like if there's ever a financial collapse, you can switch to profitability instantly. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=456.92s)]
*  So just for those who are listening and not watching us on YouTube, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=462.12s)]
*  which is the preferred mechanism for you guys to see this stuff. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=465.92s)]
*  But heck, median months to $1 million of annual revenue. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=468.64s)]
*  Before 2020, it would take 16 months. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=474.36s)]
*  Now it's taking people five months. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=476.84s)]
*  To get to 5 million, it used to take 41 months, nearly four years. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=479.92s)]
*  Today, it's taking 13 months, just one year. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=483.24s)]
*  So this is a 4x acceleration in getting significant revenue as a startup. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=485.84s)]
*  Well, Peter, remember when we graduated, I went to MicroStrategy [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  and then immediately back to Boston to start a company. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  I was building a company that was a true hyper growth company of its era, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  founded it in 91 and got it liquid in 2000. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=504.0s)]
*  So nine years to get to a $1 billion valuation and probably what? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  20, 30 million of revenue run rate, nine years. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=514.0s)]
*  That was really, really fast at that time. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=516.4000000000001s)]
*  Compare that to the numbers on this slide. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=519.8000000000001s)]
*  So here we're comparing 2020, 2023 to prior to 2020, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=522.0400000000001s)]
*  which is really the prior decade. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=527.36s)]
*  So if you look at the decade before that, it was even slower. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=530.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  Celine, these are all EXOs, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=534.52s)]
*  They're all EXOs. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=538.24s)]
*  There's a step change from 2008 where you could build a company [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=540.4000000000001s)]
*  and use cloud services and therefore you could take all computing costs [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=544.36s)]
*  and off the balance sheet and make it a variable cost, right? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=548.96s)]
*  And that was the birthplace of the EXO. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=552.08s)]
*  We may need to rewrite the whole paradigm, Peter, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=554.32s)]
*  because what's happening now is another double exponential on top of that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=556.36s)]
*  with AI accelerating everything so quickly, including path to revenue, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=561.24s)]
*  which is a huge, huge thing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=565.0s)]
*  As Dave mentioned, this now stabilizes companies very, very early [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  and that's a powerful point to be at. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=571.28s)]
*  Are you proposing the third book in our EXO series? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=573.16s)]
*  No, I hope I never read another book again. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=576.36s)]
*  The first one almost killed me. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=578.52s)]
*  The second one 90% will kill me. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=579.7199999999999s)]
*  It's a horrible, I mean, you know, I'm more proud of it than I thought we'd be, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=582.04s)]
*  but damn, it was a tough process. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=585.76s)]
*  Dave, what were you saying? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=588.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, if you look at the next slide, too, I think one of the things [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  that isn't mentioned here is the headcount. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=591.9599999999999s)]
*  The headcount that gets you to these numbers is lower than ever before by a lot. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=596.76s)]
*  You know, for me to get my first company to a billion dollar valuation, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=600.08s)]
*  I had to hire 200 people. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=603.72s)]
*  For a young entrepreneur like the cursor team, you know, or the Mercor team, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=606.0400000000001s)]
*  the comfort zone of these management teams, you know, 30, 40, 50 people, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=610.2s)]
*  feels a lot like college friends. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=614.44s)]
*  And actually, when you meet the people there, they are a lot like college friends. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=616.76s)]
*  So it is so much more fun to build one of these companies [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=620.36s)]
*  because you're in that I know everybody, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=624.0400000000001s)]
*  I know what their capabilities are. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=625.68s)]
*  We have, you know, one or two kegs for the whole gang is just so much more manageable. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=627.28s)]
*  And I bet there's a there's a curve that looks like a peak [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  of value per human being and fun value per [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  fun per human being that basically starts falling off [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=642.3599999999999s)]
*  after a pop after a company population in the 40s or 50s. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=646.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=650.12s)]
*  When I have a whole presentation on this. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=651.16s)]
*  But when you get to about 200 people and more like 100, but around 200, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=652.96s)]
*  there are people in your company you don't really know. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=657.4000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, you can't even remember their name when you walk by them. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=659.2800000000001s)]
*  That is a different world in terms of comfort [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=662.52s)]
*  and management from the one layer company where you know everybody directly. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=667.2s)]
*  It's just a whole different world. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, the other direction, you know, we're all we're all hypothesizing [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=673.96s)]
*  the company of one person that reaches a billion dollar valuation. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=676.88s)]
*  That's coming soon. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=680.48s)]
*  But that sounds really lonely to me, too. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=681.96s)]
*  I think the sweet spot, the perfect happiness sweet spot is right where we are. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  Right this minute. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=687.48s)]
*  Every week, I study the 10 major tech meta trends [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=688.52s)]
*  that will transform industries over the decade ahead. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=692.1600000000001s)]
*  I cover trends ranging from humanoid robots, AGI, quantum computing, transport, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  energy, longevity and more. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  No fluff. Only the important stuff that matters, that impacts our lives and our careers. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=702.1600000000001s)]
*  If you want me to share these with you, I write a newsletter twice a week, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=707.84s)]
*  sending it out as a short two minute read via email. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=711.76s)]

*  It's not for you if you don't want to be informed of what's coming, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=729.12s)]

*  10 plus years before anyone else. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=744.56s)]
*  I'm going to predict, though, that we're going to see a have a problem, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=747.64s)]
*  which is once these companies go through that super exciting phase and stabilize, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=750.88s)]
*  they're going to go through a lot of conniptions as they lose the buzz [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=755.24s)]
*  that got them there. Right. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=758.52s)]
*  It's a great problem to have. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=760.8s)]
*  It's like we could all wish for that kind of problem. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=762.24s)]
*  But I think you'll start. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=765.28s)]
*  You'll see a lot of angst, a lot of founders leaving, etc, etc. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=766.52s)]
*  No, they got to keep dreaming bigger. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=769.64s)]
*  It's upleveling constantly to the next level. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=771.32s)]
*  I mean, vibe coding startups are here to stay. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=774.2s)]
*  That's the story here in Stripe. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=776.48s)]
*  Cursor to 500 million dollar ARR, lovable at 17 million, bolt at 20 million. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=779.16s)]
*  So these are these are a set of technologies. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=785.44s)]
*  One of the things that makes these unique is they are technologies [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=790.08s)]
*  that will enable entrepreneurs to build other technologies and companies. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=793.88s)]
*  So they're a base layer. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=798.68s)]
*  Any other comments on this? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=801.32s)]
*  No, I think you're right. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=803.24s)]
*  I think I think when you look at the list that we had a couple of slides ago, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=804.2s)]
*  the base layer companies are about two thirds of what you see there. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=808.28s)]
*  You know, RLHF and foundation models and so forth. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=812.48s)]
*  You're starting to see, though, some multi-billion dollar [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=818.04s)]
*  value vertical companies now starting to pop up. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=820.44s)]
*  And there will be many, many more of those. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=823.0s)]
*  So to answer your question, you know, is 36 a lot? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=824.68s)]
*  Is it going to go up or down from here? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=827.28s)]
*  It's definitely going to go up more. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=828.88s)]
*  Yeah, no question. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=830.76s)]
*  At least a couple of years of really good, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=832.04s)]
*  very rapid expansion of that number. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=835.6s)]
*  And then, you know, AGI and then, you know, who can predict after that? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=838.48s)]
*  Yeah, then it goes insane. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=841.68s)]
*  I mean, the interesting thing is, you know, the IPO market is just beginning to open. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=842.8s)]
*  But the merger and acquisitions market is wide open. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=848.52s)]
*  And as we've seen, it's gone absolutely crazy in that regard. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=851.8s)]
*  So this is another interesting slide. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=857.4s)]
*  It says the new reality vibe valuation. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=859.5999999999999s)]
*  So we're seeing crazy valuations that are being, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=862.64s)]
*  you know, sort of opening bid nine billion dollars, ten billion dollars, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  30 billion dollars, never seen anything like it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=870.24s)]
*  And so vibe valuations are when an investor bets big on a gen [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  AI startup with little traditional metrics like AAR, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=876.84s)]
*  annual rate of return or cash burn. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  And this is from Vrindra Mathur. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=885.2s)]
*  This is this is a problem you've solved, Dave, right? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=889.1600000000001s)]
*  Because, you know, most people don't have access sufficiently early. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  And then you're stuck at the later valuations when the company is blossomed. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=898.2s)]
*  And like, do you invest at, you know, one hundred and twenty billion dollars into XAI or? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=902.96s)]
*  Yeah, no, we never do. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=909.2800000000001s)]
*  So it's kind of scary when you do. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=911.08s)]
*  But, you know, I was talking to General Catalyst last week, actually. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=912.96s)]
*  They've more or less abandoned seed stage because they're managing 60 billion dollars now. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=916.36s)]
*  And they need to write these big checks to keep that money moving. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=920.6s)]
*  But they're going to try and rebuild their seed stage capability. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=923.5600000000001s)]
*  They hired a new guy to do it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=926.24s)]
*  But it struck me that, you know, doing seed stage and doing 60 billion of asset management [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=928.28s)]
*  are really incompatible with each other. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=933.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=935.84s)]
*  And what's your average? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=936.84s)]
*  What's your average check size at LinkXPV? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=939.2s)]
*  Average, you know, our opening checks are often, you know, half a million, a million, two million, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=941.84s)]
*  something like that. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=947.44s)]
*  We'll allocate seven to ten million per company over time. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=949.12s)]
*  We've left billions of dollars of pro rata rights on the table over the years and pro rata rights, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=952.6800000000001s)]
*  meaning we have a right to maintain a certain ownership stake in a company. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=956.8s)]
*  But if it gets to a two billion, four billion, you know, in some cases recently, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=960.92s)]
*  ten billion dollar valuation, we can't even come close to keeping up with our pro rata rights. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=965.4s)]
*  I mean, one of the questions I get asked all the time, I'm guessing, Salim, you and Dave do as well, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=969.64s)]
*  is like, what AI company should I invest in? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=975.4399999999999s)]
*  It's like, really? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=979.1999999999999s)]
*  You want to? First of all, you're not going to get an allocation in Anthropic or OpenAI or XAI. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=980.64s)]
*  Those offerings, when they do secondaries, tenders or their next, they're snapped up instantly. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=986.88s)]
*  And then you're left with the public companies, right? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=994.9599999999999s)]
*  Which are, I mean, there is growth, but you're never going to see the real valuation growth. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=998.04s)]
*  So you're either in an AI venture fund like Link or what? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1003.4799999999999s)]
*  You're going to your local university and trying to find a startup and put it in there? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1010.04s)]
*  Well, the other option is pick a domain that you know really well that and then invest in AI companies [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1014.84s)]
*  where you can gauge the value add and the differentiator from others, right? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1020.48s)]
*  That's the only other way to do it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1026.76s)]
*  Pick an area of existing passion that you have and go down that route. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1028.16s)]
*  Well, the other thing you can do, which I love just as a life strategy, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1031.88s)]
*  is find three, four, five, six venture funds that you really, really like that are seed stage, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1035.64s)]
*  that route their pro rata rights out to their investors and say, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1040.68s)]
*  hey, look, we have capacity here. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  We can't keep up with it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1046.44s)]
*  What we do is we just email our LPs. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1048.48s)]
*  Virtually none of them read their email and react. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1051.0s)]
*  You know, and usually these deals like, you know, SpaceX or XAI, you have a week or two to make up your mind. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1054.48s)]
*  You don't have them on. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1060.44s)]
*  And so, but if you're the one investor that actually reads their email and pays attention, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1061.7600000000002s)]
*  then there are great opportunities that come your way through those. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1067.16s)]
*  Just pop open the email and then, you know, if it doesn't fill with those LPs, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1069.84s)]
*  then the new investor just takes it. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1073.44s)]
*  You know, two weeks later, it's gone. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1075.36s)]
*  So it's a pretty good strategy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1076.8s)]
*  All right. The big news this month has been the release of Super Grok. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1078.6399999999999s)]
*  I love that. I love it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1084.2s)]
*  We went from Grok to Super Grok and Grok 4 and GPT 5 is coming. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1085.2s)]
*  So this is Sam Altman on a podcast with his brother. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1090.8s)]
*  Not much content here, but worth hearing. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1094.6s)]
*  What is the time frame for GPT 5? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  When are we going to see this? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1098.48s)]
*  Probably sometime this summer. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1100.44s)]
*  OK, that was a big data point there. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1102.08s)]
*  So, you know, GPT 5 this summer. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1105.04s)]
*  One of the things that's interesting about GPT 5 is they've made a proclamation, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1110.04s)]
*  no ad influenced answers, and they're really trying to strengthen user trust. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1113.72s)]
*  So any predictions here, gentlemen? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1120.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I think it's funny. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1123.64s)]
*  Polymarket seems to think that it is less like, you know, 25 percent chance to. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1126.64s)]
*  Yeah, let's go here. There's the here's the polymarket bet. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1133.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I was almost sure like more like 80 percent in July, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1136.3200000000002s)]
*  because there's all these pictures of Sam, you know, given little hints and [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1141.2800000000002s)]
*  and also the competitive pressure kind of would line up with Grok. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1145.24s)]
*  So I was really thinking July. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1148.44s)]
*  This will be a great test of the wisdom of crowds. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  It is, you know, and we've written about that extensively. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  So here's what it says for the user. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1156.4s)]
*  You listening? The polymarket on GPT 5 release is 26 percent by July 31st [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1158.24s)]
*  and 93 percent by December 31st. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1165.4s)]
*  Yeah. All right. We'll find out. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1170.48s)]
*  I love I love this. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1174.0400000000002s)]
*  This is Grok for scoring 35 percent on humanity's last exam, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1176.96s)]
*  45 percent if they're using their reasoning model. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1184.6s)]
*  And you can see, you know, I'm always trying to track these models against each other. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1189.16s)]
*  And I love it when they say the model's IQ is so so and so, but they don't always do that. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1193.64s)]
*  The last time I saw it on the sort of the IQ scale was at [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1200.0s)]
*  I think it was GPT 03 at IQ of 136. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1205.56s)]
*  Yep, that's right. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1210.04s)]
*  But so let me read this about humanity's last exam. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1211.32s)]
*  It's a challenging A.I. benchmark developed by the Center for A.I. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1215.76s)]
*  Safety and Scale A.I. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1219.28s)]
*  consists of 3000 expert crafted multimodal questions across 100 subjects, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1221.12s)]
*  including mathematics, physics, biology, medicine, humanity, social sciences and more. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1227.12s)]
*  Humanity's last exam tests the limits of an A.I. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1232.68s)]
*  at the frontier of human knowledge. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  And I found this interesting that the questions are crowdsourced from really [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1237.92s)]
*  a thousand experts globally. So I know if you're a listener and you got an extra minute, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1240.96s)]
*  you got to look up the actual exam and look at a couple of the questions [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1246.92s)]
*  that I defy anyone to answer a single question. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1251.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, unless you're the world's leading expert on that particular, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1255.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, there's questions from physics, from math, from philosophy, from history, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1260.04s)]
*  covers every area. But I defy you to answer one question correctly. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1264.92s)]
*  It's so hard. And this test is supposed to last like 10 years. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1270.52s)]
*  Yeah. So I have the I have the I have the counterpoint on all this. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1274.8s)]
*  Yeah. You know, this this I find this mostly irrelevant. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1279.64s)]
*  The reason I say that is this feels to me like asking a question like, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1286.04s)]
*  oh, my God, that calculator can make a calculation way faster than a human being [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1291.6s)]
*  with a piece of paper and a pencil doing a long division. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1295.76s)]
*  Well, of course it can't. So what? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1298.1599999999999s)]
*  I think that's true. And to Dave's point, if you put I looked up a few questions, right? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1300.68s)]
*  One of them is, is there a God? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1305.52s)]
*  And you ask an A.I. that question and they give you the standard. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1306.8s)]
*  Here's the different ways you could look at it. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1309.32s)]
*  Monotheism versus deism versus atheism versus whatever, whatever. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1311.32s)]
*  It's not clear if there's a God. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1315.84s)]
*  You could take each point depends on your personal perspective. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1317.12s)]
*  Dada, dada, dada. It's a non-answer. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1319.6399999999999s)]
*  If you looked up Wikipedia on any of these topics, you could kind of root through [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1322.08s)]
*  and find the answer and answer the question yourself. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1326.3999999999999s)]
*  Some of the details ones. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1329.16s)]
*  This is essentially like saying we're automating Wikipedia. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1330.84s)]
*  And so can you answer the question? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1334.8s)]
*  Can Wikipedia answer these questions better than human being? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1336.92s)]
*  Of course it can because it has all the data to do it. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1339.44s)]
*  So having to be able to answer these questions does not really make that much of it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1342.3600000000001s)]
*  It doesn't feel meaningful to me at all. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1347.52s)]
*  Yeah. I think the really big question is really important. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1349.56s)]
*  What do we do with it? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1351.92s)]
*  Yeah, I know you're I think you're on something really, really important and interesting. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1353.48s)]
*  And, you know, all the dystopians are like, oh, my God, it's going to run away from us. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1356.44s)]
*  And, you know, but it actually when you're using it at this level of intelligence, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1360.04s)]
*  it feels exactly like Jarvis in an Iron Man movie where, you know, Tony Stark [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1364.44s)]
*  is saying, here's what we need to do. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1369.48s)]
*  And Jarvis is like, oh, I never thought of that, but I can, you know, I can create that for you. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1371.68s)]
*  And it actually is behaving almost exactly the way they visualized it in that movie. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1375.76s)]
*  And so when it when it ratchets up this curve and you ask it like, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1380.2s)]
*  I need to design a protein that does exactly this or I need to design a new type of bicycle [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1383.76s)]
*  that does exactly this, it gives you great, great answers back and does the work for you. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1388.72s)]
*  But it never has. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1394.0s)]
*  The word reasoning is being really bastardized when we talk about [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1395.52s)]
*  what's happening in reasoning here is iterative reprompting of the same old thing, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1399.0s)]
*  which squeezes more performance out of it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1404.72s)]
*  But it's not really like human reasoning and brainstorming. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1406.92s)]
*  And so it's kind of a bummer that we borrowed the word reasoning to describe what's going on here. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1410.2s)]
*  But it is so useful as a tool for a creative person. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1414.6s)]
*  And a hundred percent, hundred percent in to do actions and get things done [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1418.52s)]
*  and do almost any imaginable thing faster and faster. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1423.8s)]
*  Huge. For example, I've got a lot of pain in my shoulder. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1427.28s)]
*  So I had an MRI done as to what was going on. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1430.32s)]
*  It's taking me weeks to get a doctor's appointment. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1432.8s)]
*  I uploaded it into an AI and it's given me the answer in two seconds. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1435.16s)]
*  That kind of speed of decision making and getting to conclusions. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1438.92s)]
*  So is it is it going for is it an alien growing inside your body? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1442.64s)]
*  What I seem to have a bone spur and that's impinging on the nerve and it's causing pain. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1447.4s)]
*  And so so I had I had the exact same surgery with a bone spur. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1451.52s)]
*  A piece of recommendation for you, because I did an actual test. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  I had the same surgery on both shoulders with the same surgeon ten years apart. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1460.48s)]
*  I did it when I was 50 on my left and when I was 60 on my right. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1465.72s)]
*  And on my right shoulder, I injected exosomes post surgery one week after and two weeks after. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1469.24s)]
*  My recovery was like twice as fast. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1476.48s)]
*  So, OK, squirts, personally, what's the maybe your surgeon? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1479.72s)]
*  I'll bring him. He's at Curlin Joe about here in LA. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1484.16s)]
*  He's amazing. Right. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1486.88s)]
*  I expect to see massive. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1488.0s)]
*  So just to come back to this, the the speed of getting to outcomes and decisions [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1490.6s)]
*  and getting things done, the speed of that will accelerate radically, which is fantastic. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1496.2s)]
*  And now it comes down to what do you want to accomplish? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1500.88s)]
*  I think that's the bigger questions that we're going to start pondering. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1503.44s)]
*  So here's a big one we keep on cursing about. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1506.64s)]
*  I keep on tweeting about how awful Syria is. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1509.84s)]
*  And thank God, you know, it's literally literally [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1513.56s)]
*  I know that you've been an Android user, Salim, for a while now and forever. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1517.08s)]
*  Just what we saw at Google I.O. was epic. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1521.88s)]
*  And so I am going to buy a I've got an, you know, the latest iPhone here, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1524.96s)]
*  but I am going to buy an Android phone as well [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1528.76s)]
*  so that I can start to play with all of Google's incredible tech [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1531.92s)]
*  and also because Siri sucks so bad, they're pushing me away. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1535.8s)]
*  Having said that, the Here's the News article from Bloomberg [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1539.76s)]
*  Apple ways using Anthropic or OpenAI for Siri rather than in-house AI team. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1543.2800000000002s)]
*  Let's take a quick listen. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1548.4s)]
*  So Apple is now evaluating for the first time using a third party model, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1549.44s)]
*  either Claude from Anthropic or ChatGPT from OpenAI to power Siri. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1554.64s)]
*  Obviously, as we all know and experienced in our day to day lives, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1559.5200000000002s)]
*  Siri is not very good. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1562.3600000000001s)]
*  Now it's exploring maybe using Claude or ChatGPT instead [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1564.3200000000002s)]
*  in order to get new features out the door more quickly [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1567.96s)]
*  and make the voice assistant more appealing. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1570.48s)]
*  You talk to people at Apple, though, the word on the street there is [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1572.28s)]
*  it's all about Anthropic. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1575.72s)]
*  And so Anthropic is really the focus of Apple for this new generation of Siri. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1577.24s)]
*  They're using Anthropic to power a lot of their internal AI technology. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1582.36s)]
*  But again, as I say in my story, Anthropic wants billions of dollars [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1586.2s)]
*  at a scale that doubles annually for Siri to be powered by Claude. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1589.76s)]
*  And so Apple is now taking a close look at OpenAI as well, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1593.68s)]
*  which has historically given Apple extraordinarily favorable terms. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1596.56s)]
*  Son of desperation or smart move in terms of what Apple is doing? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1600.28s)]
*  It's a smart move in response to desperation. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1604.44s)]
*  I love that. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1609.0800000000002s)]
*  So interesting, right, because Anthropic is also partnered with Amazon. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1610.4s)]
*  And if they've got Apple and Amazon and billions of dollars of revenue, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1615.6000000000001s)]
*  they stand a good chance of really rapid acceleration. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1621.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, we talked a week ago about [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1626.4s)]
*  Miramarati's new startup and Elio Suscovitz's new startup, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1629.56s)]
*  both doing new foundation model companies from scratch. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1632.52s)]
*  Huge valuations. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1635.76s)]
*  Part of the logic there is the musical chairs. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1637.72s)]
*  There aren't enough anthropics to go around, as you're pointing out. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1639.96s)]
*  And so there's a version of Anthropic where it's an independent company for 10 years. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1643.48s)]
*  But there's another version where it gets acquired by Amazon or Apple [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1647.24s)]
*  and the other guy gets deprived. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1650.56s)]
*  And this is, you know, just just happened recently with ScaleAI as well. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1652.08s)]
*  And so there's room in the market for more foundation model companies. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1656.28s)]
*  But, you know, the price of poker is very high now and going up quickly. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1661.08s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1664.68s)]
*  I mean, if you get if you get alignment of Anthropic with Apple, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1665.8799999999999s)]
*  like a, you know, a captured entity, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1669.56s)]
*  OpenAI, you know, has been dancing with individual partners for a while. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1673.52s)]
*  Google the same. You're right. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1678.32s)]
*  There's there's room for a couple of others. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1680.04s)]
*  I have some I have some comments here on this course. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1682.24s)]
*  You know, this is classic corporate innovators dilemma, right? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1685.44s)]
*  You cannot do disruptive innovation in any big company from now on. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1689.8s)]
*  There's it's not an accident that that Microsoft essentially invested [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1694.64s)]
*  in OpenAI or Amazon put money into Claude or whatever. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1698.4s)]
*  You cannot build that capability. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1702.16s)]
*  The mindset is too different between Apple being a consumer products company [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1704.08s)]
*  largely and the mindset needed and being under 25 to even start [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1708.92s)]
*  and kind of a foundational model company. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1713.52s)]
*  You have to partner and invest and do this. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1715.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm surprised that it's taken Apple this long because they do all their manufacturing [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1718.68s)]
*  with a partner in Foxconn. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1721.8799999999999s)]
*  Why aren't they building core capability like this on the edge? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1723.56s)]
*  And then you go ahead. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1726.4s)]
*  Well, I'm sorry. I mean, because you have to learn. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1729.24s)]
*  So just a reminder, though, so today, Nvidia is worth more than Apple [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1730.8799999999999s)]
*  like this exact day in world history. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1734.92s)]
*  Apple never in a million years could have predicted that five years ago. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1738.76s)]
*  In fact, Apple treated Nvidia like like dirt. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1741.88s)]
*  But Apple has the chip manufacturing. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1744.8400000000001s)]
*  They have about a third of TSMC's manufacturing capacity. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1747.44s)]
*  They were in a far better position to become Nvidia [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1750.68s)]
*  than Nvidia was, but had no recognition of the opportunity whatsoever. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1753.8000000000002s)]
*  So here's the problem. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1758.8400000000001s)]
*  Here's the problem. And Salim, you know, I've discussed this. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1760.3600000000001s)]
*  It's about founder led companies. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1762.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. So Jensen as the CEO and founder of Nvidia is driving it. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1766.72s)]
*  And when he says right, everybody goes right. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1771.76s)]
*  The same thing with Dario at Anthropic, you know, the same thing with Sam [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1774.84s)]
*  at OpenAI, but Apple has lost Steve Jobs. Right. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1778.84s)]
*  Steve would have been all over this and he would have set up the team [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1783.72s)]
*  that would have just basically driven it. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1788.16s)]
*  And it's it's innovators dilemma. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1790.24s)]
*  But during this period of exponential growth, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1792.76s)]
*  you need a dictatorial, passion driven founder [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1796.04s)]
*  who has the has the, you know, complete faith of his board [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1800.6799999999998s)]
*  and his or her board and their management team. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1805.28s)]
*  I mean, Salim, do you agree with that? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1810.08s)]
*  I somewhat disagree. OK. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1811.84s)]
*  I think I think, yes, if you're in that industry, like, for example, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1813.8s)]
*  if you're Facebook and you need Facebook to do something different [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1817.4399999999998s)]
*  and your Mark and your Zuckerberg, you can kind of get that done. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1820.28s)]
*  And it's important to get that done. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1823.1599999999999s)]
*  But the control systems, remember, the big companies are optimized [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  for two things, right, efficiency and predictability. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1828.44s)]
*  This comes from John Hagel and John Sealy Brown's work. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1831.72s)]
*  And so you're trying to deliver the iPods at the same [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1835.0s)]
*  AirPods at the same quality into a million retail locations [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1838.8s)]
*  for purchase by everybody and their grandmother. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1842.3200000000002s)]
*  Your your entire focus is on that. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1844.96s)]
*  You cannot do disruptive things when you've got that machine [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1847.24s)]
*  trying to deliver gross margins on a. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1851.2s)]
*  But you could do what Steve Jobs did, right? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1853.44s)]
*  He took his Mac team and he moved it off. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1855.52s)]
*  On the edge. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1858.6799999999998s)]
*  You have to do that edge innovation in a stealth way. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1859.84s)]
*  Google is doing it with X, right? Google X. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1863.56s)]
*  This is what we try to do with Brickhouse at Yahoo. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1867.36s)]
*  You have to do that type of model. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1870.04s)]
*  And then the second level of things is when it starts to succeed, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1871.8s)]
*  don't bring it back in because it won't fit. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1874.9599999999998s)]
*  If it's really disruptive, it's not going to fit in the mothership. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1877.4399999999998s)]
*  You have to spin it off. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1880.24s)]
*  Now, lately, companies have kind of tried. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1881.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean, like Amazon did with with AWS in one sense. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1884.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Or Google is this is why Google split up into [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1887.16s)]
*  Alphabet, spinning off Waymo and whatever. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1891.0400000000002s)]
*  So this is the only model that works. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1894.0s)]
*  I've looked at me and my ecosystem. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1896.4s)]
*  We've looked at disruptive innovation across probably 200 of the Fortune 500 [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1898.92s)]
*  companies in detail. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1904.28s)]
*  And this is the only modality that ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever works. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1905.68s)]
*  It's the only one. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1910.52s)]
*  And so you have to do that or you acquire that disruption [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1911.64s)]
*  and you leave it on the edge the way Microsoft has done with OpenAI [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1914.52s)]
*  or Zuckerberg did with WhatsApp. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1918.6s)]
*  You will kill it inside the core organization. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1921.4s)]
*  It won't work. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1923.92s)]
*  And let me give you the negative side. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1924.68s)]
*  Walmart realized somewhere in the mid 2000s [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1927.92s)]
*  that it had to compete with Amazon, that this e-commerce thing was not a fad. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1930.76s)]
*  So they set up a team inside Bentonville and they said to that team, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1934.16s)]
*  All right, we have the best distribution logistics in the world. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1936.84s)]
*  Go beat Amazon. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1939.08s)]
*  Within 18 months, the immune system had killed it. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1940.36s)]
*  Could all the existing managers that we have our own capability, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1942.76s)]
*  we should be optimizing for our own stores. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1946.2s)]
*  Look at that P ratio is never going to succeed. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1948.04s)]
*  Da da da da da. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1949.96s)]
*  They did it a second time. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1951.08s)]
*  Second time, they put the team at the edge and they said, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1952.28s)]
*  All right, go to the edge away from the core and do the same thing, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1954.32s)]
*  but still use our existing systems. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1957.24s)]
*  We have the best in the world. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1958.72s)]
*  Within 18 months, the business had figured it out and killed it. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1960.0s)]
*  And they did it a third time. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  Third time, they made an amazingly courageous decision. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1964.36s)]
*  They said, go to the edge and build your own independent supply chain [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1966.68s)]
*  distribution, et cetera. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1970.52s)]
*  Even though we have the best in the world, we have to figure this out. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1971.52s)]
*  Started to succeed. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1974.6s)]
*  The business got excited, pulled it back in and killed it. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1976.0s)]
*  And it was on iteration number four that they finally did it [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1978.96s)]
*  separately on the edge and only after it achieved critical mass [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1981.84s)]
*  that they start stitching the back ends together. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1985.3600000000001s)]
*  But in that intervening six or eight years, Amazon was gone. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1987.72s)]
*  You know, interesting story. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1991.1200000000001s)]
*  And ladies and gentlemen, this is why Salim Ismail is incredibly brilliant [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1992.2s)]
*  and why I love him so dearly. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1997.4s)]
*  It's just that we've seen so much of this across so many. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=1999.08s)]
*  We have so many data points over 10, 15 years of looking at this [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2001.84s)]
*  and looking at big companies in great detail. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2005.24s)]
*  It just doesn't work any other way than for looking for the disruptive [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2007.68s)]
*  technologies, bring buying them or investing them and leaving them on the edge. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2012.92s)]
*  And I, Dave, you're going to say, oh, well, I just happened to be in Bentville, Arkansas. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2018.12s)]
*  You know, they're my biggest customer at the time, Walmart, as this was going on. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2022.3999999999999s)]
*  So just one little interesting nugget on your story there, Salim, when Jeff Bezos [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2026.92s)]
*  needed to recruit Rick Dalzell, he needed one brilliant retail industry [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2031.68s)]
*  guy to come out to Seattle and make Amazon like organized and structured [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2036.2s)]
*  and then retailing because everyone he had was kind of a computer science PhD type. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2042.04s)]
*  And so he needed Rick Dalzell, but he actually took Sam Walton's book. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2046.16s)]
*  And there was a sentence in it where Sam predicted that a disruptive innovator [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2050.16s)]
*  will eventually come along and gut Walmart. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2053.88s)]
*  And so he circled that sentence and took it to Rick's house. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2056.96s)]
*  Because, you know, the Walmart gang is super tight. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2060.84s)]
*  They're like a family and trying to break up a member of the family is almost impossible. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2062.52s)]
*  And Rick needed to talk to his wife about this, like a big change [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2067.0s)]
*  moving from Bentonville out to Seattle. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2070.08s)]
*  But the book is what put it over the top. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2071.84s)]
*  He circled Sam's own words, predicting the disruptive [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2073.44s)]
*  innovator will come for us and we won't be able to defend ourselves. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2077.48s)]
*  Can I can I flip to the other side for a second? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2081.16s)]
*  In 1990, when I was starting out in my career, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2083.76s)]
*  I was building software systems and I went to Bentonville [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2087.2400000000002s)]
*  and we were trying to sell Walmart something. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2090.0s)]
*  We passed the M.E. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2092.04s)]
*  sent all these crazy NDAs to go into the data center. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2093.36s)]
*  And I was like, why would you have me send NDAs to go through a data center? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2096.04s)]
*  It's just there's nothing there but racks of service. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2098.84s)]
*  We walked past a particular room which has like flashing lights and dials [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2101.56s)]
*  and blinking things that I've never seen. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2105.28s)]
*  And I said, what the hell is that room? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2107.4s)]
*  And they said, oh, that's why the NDA. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2109.48s)]
*  That's our satellite control center. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2111.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2113.2s)]
*  And they had their own geo stationary satellite [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2113.92s)]
*  because Bentonville happens to be the geographic center of the U.S. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2116.12s)]
*  the continental U.S. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  And they were doing everybody else was doing batch updates [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2120.48s)]
*  to their S 400s at the end of the day. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2123.72s)]
*  And the buyers didn't know what to buy for the stores till months afterwards. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2126.04s)]
*  Whereas these guys had real time inventory management, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2130.16s)]
*  credit card reconciliation, distribution, logistics, all that stuff figured out. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2132.64s)]
*  And that was delivering them 15 percent better margins, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2137.68s)]
*  which in the retail industry is insane. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2140.72s)]
*  And that's why they wiped the floor with Amazon. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2143.16s)]
*  When you can successfully integrate disruptive technologies as a big company, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2145.44s)]
*  you have a street streets ahead of the competition. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2149.68s)]
*  And they show that's what we call a moonshot, right? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2152.48s)]
*  Exponential tech with a crazy idea and a high revenue. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2156.7999999999997s)]
*  I would love to meet the executive of Walmart. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2161.08s)]
*  If anybody is saying in the news, I'd love to interview whoever the executive was [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2163.3599999999997s)]
*  that got the board to do this. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2167.16s)]
*  That's like that's hardcore. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2169.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2170.92s)]
*  We're going to we're going to move on here. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2171.52s)]
*  So let's take a look. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2174.6s)]
*  This is the state of the union on large scale AI models. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2177.12s)]
*  We're seeing GROCK3 and GPT 4.5 at the top of this in 2025. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2181.08s)]
*  You know, I looked up where XAI is right now. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2189.8s)]
*  So the XAI cluster has three hundred and forty thousand Nvidia GPUs today. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2193.36s)]
*  One hundred fifty thousand H one hundred, fifty thousand H two hundred, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2200.08s)]
*  thirty thousand GB two hundred of the Blackwell architecture. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2203.2400000000002s)]
*  Their goal, what Elon has announced, is a million GPUs by December 31st. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2207.7200000000003s)]
*  So I mean, he is scaling, I think, faster than anybody. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2213.96s)]
*  And it's pretty extraordinary. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2220.56s)]
*  Any comments on this, Dave, before I move on? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2222.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, the scale on the left side is somebody out there [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2224.6s)]
*  listening should give some terminology to this so we can stay on the same page. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2228.72s)]
*  Like, you know, calling it one E twenty six or one E twenty seven training. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2231.72s)]
*  So like a petaflop is a huge amount of compute. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2236.16s)]
*  That's one E fifteen. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2238.72s)]
*  So that's way off the bottom of the chart here. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2240.56s)]
*  So that goes X a flop and then Zeta flop, which would be one E twenty one. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2242.48s)]
*  So you're getting near the chart. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2246.2799999999997s)]
*  Nobody has terminology for scales of this size, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2248.3999999999996s)]
*  but we do need to talk about it and other than exponential. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2252.16s)]
*  So that's my challenge for the audience. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2254.8799999999997s)]
*  Like somebody named these scales. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2256.16s)]
*  One E twenty six is officially a shitload of compute. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2258.08s)]
*  It's really hard to imagine. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2261.56s)]
*  You know, Peter, you took a tour, right, of the XAI data center. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2263.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2266.68s)]
*  I'm an investor in XAI full disclosure. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2268.2799999999997s)]
*  So, yeah. Yeah. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2270.2s)]
*  I mean, it's the this it's, you know, Raiders of the Lost Ark, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2271.72s)]
*  where there's this rose and it goes to infinity, like these rows of boxes. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2275.24s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2279.16s)]
*  Well, one of the key points [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2280.48s)]
*  that we need to talk about on the back end of this is how do you power this? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2283.44s)]
*  We're talking about every week that the limits are not the GPUs. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2288.12s)]
*  The limits are our electrical available power system. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2293.2s)]
*  So this is an article that came out. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2296.8s)]
*  Elon Musk purchases overseas power plant to support massive XAI data center. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2299.92s)]
*  So XAI acquired a fully built overseas gas turbine power plant [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2306.28s)]
*  expected to house nearly a million GPUs and be powered by that power plant. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2311.28s)]
*  So it's an conventional approach to basically, you know, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2315.84s)]
*  get power as quickly as possible. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2319.84s)]
*  I remember in about a year and a half ago when XAI announced its Colossus system. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2321.96s)]
*  And I was listening into an investor Zoom with Elon. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2329.56s)]
*  He said, you know, this was in May before they built it. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2333.04s)]
*  And he said, OK, we're going to build it by the end of the summer, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2336.04s)]
*  like within three months. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2339.2000000000003s)]
*  And people thought it would take like five years to build what he wanted to do. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2340.36s)]
*  Integrate 100,000 H100s. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2343.9199999999996s)]
*  And he said to do this, we have to corner the US market on helium. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2346.8799999999997s)]
*  And I mean, just the level of thinking of doing whatever it takes. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2352.44s)]
*  And here's an example of that. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2356.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, pretty awesome. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2358.68s)]
*  We had that podcast with Eric Schmidt that should be out in about a week, I hope. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2360.08s)]
*  I hope. Yeah. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2365.6s)]
*  But we talked a lot about energy supply. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2366.72s)]
*  He's very knowledgeable in this whole area of energy supply. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2368.3999999999996s)]
*  And here we're talking about two gigawatts. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2373.04s)]
*  I mean, this is a big, big, bold move. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2375.12s)]
*  But remember, we need 100 gigawatts by 2029. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2376.6s)]
*  There's a lot more. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2381.2s)]
*  So you would have to do this 50 times over just then. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2382.2s)]
*  This that just gets you the turbines, right? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2384.8s)]
*  It doesn't get you the actual power supply. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2386.52s)]
*  This is all going to be fossil fuels. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2388.64s)]
*  I think the important point here is it's disruptive thinking. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2390.08s)]
*  It's unconventional. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2393.08s)]
*  It's no, we're not going to go through the permitting process. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2394.16s)]
*  No, we're not going to order. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2396.56s)]
*  We're just going to buy the shit and move it over here and use it. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2397.56s)]
*  And I think that's the first principle thinking. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2401.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Just to calibrate for the folks listening, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2403.4s)]
*  one gigawatt is about what a major city in the US uses. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2406.1600000000003s)]
*  So this is like two dollars for it worth. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2410.6000000000004s)]
*  It's all to calibrate. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2412.76s)]
*  You know, the new Elon Musk could become Chase Lockmiller. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2413.96s)]
*  He's the other guy thinking this way. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2417.44s)]
*  He's doing, you know, Abilene, Texas, Stargate, you know, 500 billion dollar build out. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2418.7200000000003s)]
*  He thought the same way. Like, where am I going to go to build this? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2425.44s)]
*  OK, there's there's actual natural gas flare off. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2427.8s)]
*  That's not even being used. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2430.6s)]
*  And power generation that's that's so abundant that it's not even being used [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2432.24s)]
*  in this one location in the country. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2436.8399999999997s)]
*  So I'm just going to he was in Denver. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2438.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to pick up my pick up my ass and move to Abilene, Texas. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2440.24s)]
*  And that's where we're going to do it. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2443.4s)]
*  Because this is this is exponential thinking. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2444.4s)]
*  This is entrepreneurial thinking. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2447.3199999999997s)]
*  This is when I know we're going to get to, you know, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2449.04s)]
*  A.S.I. digital super intelligence. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2452.16s)]
*  When you say to your A.I., where can I get the power I need? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2454.7599999999998s)]
*  And it says, well, I found this power plant over in Europe. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2458.04s)]
*  It costs this much. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2461.48s)]
*  Let's buy it and move it here. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2462.7599999999998s)]
*  When it makes those kind of suggestions, then I'm impressed. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2464.0s)]
*  All right. You mentioned this, Dave, why don't you lead us off on this one? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2468.84s)]
*  Yeah. So, you know, we took a bet around the office of many years ago. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2472.52s)]
*  Maybe. I don't know. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2476.64s)]
*  What company would be the first to hit a trillion dollar market cap [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2478.16s)]
*  in the history of the world? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2480.7999999999997s)]
*  Is it going to be Google, Apple, Facebook or Microsoft? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2481.7999999999997s)]
*  Because those are the only candidates who else could possibly get there. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2484.24s)]
*  At the time, Nvidia wouldn't even have been like [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2487.32s)]
*  you wouldn't even vaguely consider it an outside possibility. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2490.72s)]
*  And what Salima is saying all the time, it's always the outsider, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2494.0s)]
*  up and comer, founder led visionary that blindsides you [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2498.48s)]
*  and is now the most valuable company in the world. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2503.08s)]
*  This, you know, you could argue whether it's overvalued or undervalued, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2506.72s)]
*  but the demand for compute for A.I. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2509.64s)]
*  is going to be 10,000 times higher than the supply for the foreseeable future. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2513.2799999999997s)]
*  There's a coming wave of technological convergence as A.I., [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2518.24s)]
*  robots and other exponential tech transform every company and industry. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2522.04s)]
*  And in its wake, no job or career will be left untouched. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2526.68s)]
*  The people who are going to win in the coming era won't be the strongest. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2530.0s)]
*  It won't even be the smartest. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2533.52s)]
*  It'll be the people who are fastest to spot trends and to adapt. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2534.92s)]
*  A few weeks ago, I took everything I teach to executive teams [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2538.44s)]
*  about navigating disruption, spotting exponential trends a decade out [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2541.88s)]
*  and put them into a course designed for one purpose, to future proof your life, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2546.56s)]
*  your career and your company against this coming surge of A.I., [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2550.84s)]
*  humanoids and exponential tech. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2554.96s)]

*  The link is below. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2567.92s)]
*  I'm going to read the article headline NVIDIA sets new milestone [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2569.4s)]
*  with a three point nine two trillion dollar market cap, topping Apple's [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2572.56s)]
*  three point nine one five trillion dollar market cap. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2577.52s)]
*  So, I mean, I, you know, I looked at NVIDIA [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2581.12s)]
*  a year ago and six months ago, and my answer was how much higher could it go? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2586.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, there here's the answer. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2591.3599999999997s)]
*  So here's the question, right? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2594.04s)]
*  There there is a bet to be made right now [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2595.44s)]
*  if you're an investor on where are you going to invest to ride this curve? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2598.64s)]
*  Because it's not slowing down. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2603.16s)]
*  Are you going to decide on the chip side? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2606.72s)]
*  Are you going to invest in the power generation side? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2609.16s)]
*  Are you going to invest in the you know, I have a friend of mine [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2612.7999999999997s)]
*  who has identified geothermal energy [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2615.8799999999997s)]
*  as the as a key source of energy. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2619.52s)]
*  And so he's going to start drilling over a geothermal bed, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2622.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, bedrock hard zone and put in a large plant over there. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2626.88s)]
*  So is it real estate? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2631.8s)]
*  Is it data centers? Is it chips? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2633.44s)]
*  Is it power? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2635.56s)]
*  Because all of these things are going to make somebody, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2636.88s)]
*  hopefully somebody listening right now, huge amounts of wealth. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2640.12s)]
*  This is this is unstoppable. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2643.7200000000003s)]
*  Metatrend period. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2646.32s)]
*  To clarify one thing on the slide, too, because it's even more profound than that seemed. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2647.88s)]
*  NVIDIA just beat Apple's all time high, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2652.2400000000002s)]
*  which was Christmas Eve this past six months ago. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2655.3599999999997s)]
*  It's actually significantly higher than Apple today. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2660.7999999999997s)]
*  Apple's down to three point two trillion. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2662.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, well, NVIDIA is at three point nine to. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2665.2799999999997s)]
*  So it's a significant gap that's opened up. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2669.12s)]
*  And yeah, I don't think anyone would have seen it would have seen it coming. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2673.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, Sam Altman is always saying that, you know, a lot of people [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2677.2s)]
*  think about this as victims, like, oh, this goes up, that goes down. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2680.6s)]
*  It's really not true. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2684.24s)]
*  Like everybody participating in this build out is going up. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2685.4s)]
*  And there are some companies that are getting crushed along the way, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2688.96s)]
*  but they're they're kind of rounding errors compared to the number of things [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2691.48s)]
*  that are going up. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2693.88s)]
*  So David Salim, where would you invest? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2695.0s)]
*  I want to hear where would you invest right now? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2697.48s)]
*  Because people are asking, you know, our super fans here are asking that question. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2700.08s)]
*  Where do I put my money? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2704.7999999999997s)]
*  I would do a basket of these to get the general trend [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2707.24s)]
*  and get the general transformative trend. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2710.4s)]
*  And then I would pick certain verticals where I can make a massive difference [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2713.12s)]
*  and then invest in the companies going after those. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2717.9599999999996s)]
*  What's in your bucket? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2720.7999999999997s)]
*  Hell knows. I'm trying to put everything into Bitcoin, so it's hard to think. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2724.72s)]
*  No, I'm not. That's my bucket as well. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2727.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm famous for kind of a lot of people ask me, oh, my God, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2730.2s)]
*  you've been tracking Tesla forever. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2732.6s)]
*  You must have made a fortune. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2734.0s)]
*  And the answer is no, because every quarter for a long, long time, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2735.7599999999998s)]
*  it looks like Elon was going to run out of money. Right. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2738.4399999999996s)]
*  I even had the chance, as you mentioned, Peter, to invest in XAI [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2742.0s)]
*  at a crazy valuation. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2745.76s)]
*  And I said no, and it's 10x from that. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2747.04s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, it's a very hard game to play. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2750.0s)]
*  And you have to really set aside a lot of assumptions to do it. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2753.6000000000004s)]
*  And in general, I think you just buy these top hyperscalers and just sit on it. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2756.92s)]
*  And this is not investment advice, by the way, I should say that. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2763.1600000000003s)]
*  Dave, what's in your bucket? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2765.92s)]
*  For me, it's a no brainer because we have access to some incredible [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2768.0s)]
*  investments that most people can't access. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2771.2s)]
*  But in the software layer, which is not nearly as capital intensive, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2773.24s)]
*  there are 10 and 100 X performance improvements. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2776.96s)]
*  So so when you're looking at, you know, Elon buying a million chips, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2779.12s)]
*  a million and a half chips, you know, it's a 30, 40 billion dollar risk. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2782.16s)]
*  If you accelerate the algorithm running on those chips by 10x, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2787.8799999999997s)]
*  you just saved an enormous amount of money. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2791.12s)]
*  And so it's not as capital intensive. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2793.72s)]
*  The innovations are right in front of us. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2795.64s)]
*  You know, blitzy down the hall for me here is innovating, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2797.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, writing three to 10 million lines of code a night. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2800.76s)]
*  So you can implement these ideas in like a week. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2803.8s)]
*  So that is where you get the highest very quick returns. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2807.32s)]
*  And so if you have access, that's the sweet spot. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2811.0400000000004s)]
*  Now, when you go to the conferences, like when we go to Riyadh together, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2813.6400000000003s)]
*  we go to, you know, one of these big you don't hear about that as much [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2816.36s)]
*  because it's not as capital intensive. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2819.88s)]
*  And they're all putting much larger amounts of money into physical real estate [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2822.88s)]
*  generators, power supplies, chip buys, spaceships. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2826.56s)]
*  You know, that's where all the money goes because they're very capital intensive. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2830.8399999999997s)]
*  So it tends to dominate the agenda. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2833.52s)]
*  But the returns are far, far better in the software layer. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2835.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, just to round up a comment on this slide, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2839.2s)]
*  I was talking to an executive in Intel who was saying, oh, my God, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2842.72s)]
*  look at that P ratio. That's insane for Nvidia, etc. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2846.08s)]
*  And my comment was, I'd rather be them than you. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2849.3199999999997s)]
*  That's brutal, dude. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2853.8399999999997s)]
*  But that's the reality of it. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2855.52s)]
*  I mean, it's the moaning and whinging from the income [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2856.72s)]
*  of the former incumbents is incredible. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2860.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2862.72s)]
*  Mercor partners with six of the magnificent seven [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2864.7599999999998s)]
*  and all top five AI labs. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2868.96s)]
*  Super proud. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2871.56s)]
*  Dave, this is one of your key investments at Link XPV. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2873.56s)]
*  We had Brendan Fudi [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2877.28s)]
*  with us at the Abundance Summit last year. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2879.68s)]
*  Tell us about about Mercor. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2882.52s)]
*  So, you know, Brendan is just an awesome guy. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2884.8s)]
*  And talk about getting lucky again. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2887.28s)]
*  Scale AI got acquired last week. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2890.0400000000004s)]
*  What? 29 billion dollars by Metta. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2893.1200000000003s)]
*  All the customers of scale are like, well, now I can't work with scale anymore. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2896.84s)]
*  It's part of Metta. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2901.0s)]
*  All the other competing big AI labs. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2901.76s)]
*  So now Brendan's got all of them, except for one, actually. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2904.76s)]
*  Guess which one he doesn't have? He has six of the seven. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2908.6800000000003s)]
*  Metta. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2911.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you'd think, you know, actually, that was his anchor customer. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2913.32s)]
*  So he still technically has it. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2917.6000000000004s)]
*  But that would be. Yes. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2918.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's exactly right. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2920.76s)]
*  It's Elon Musk doing it all himself. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2922.48s)]
*  Elon doesn't like partnering with people. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2925.08s)]
*  He likes to build vertically internally. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2927.2000000000003s)]
*  So I had a curiosity just so folks can know how awesome you are. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2929.56s)]
*  At what stage should you guys invest in Brendan? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2933.48s)]
*  How old was he then? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2936.84s)]
*  And what and what's the valuation now? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2938.96s)]
*  Because, I mean, this is the story that people need to realize. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2940.92s)]
*  You know, it used to be the peak age for building a unicorn was in [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2944.88s)]
*  sort of early to mid 30s, and it's dropped a decade. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2948.56s)]
*  It's now like the peak age for creating a unicorn is like 20 to 23. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2952.2000000000003s)]
*  So tell us the story there, Dave. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2956.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. So we were the first money in Brendan. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2958.04s)]
*  He was actually he and two of his best friends from high school [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2960.6800000000003s)]
*  started the company together. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2964.4s)]
*  Two of them went to Georgetown. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2966.28s)]
*  The third friend went to Harvard. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2967.48s)]
*  That made them eligible for Prod, which is this really, really cool [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2969.68s)]
*  student run, student founded joint venture club between MIT, Harvard and Stanford. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2973.04s)]
*  So they did Prod, which is where they developed the idea for Morcor together. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2979.2s)]
*  And then we found them at Prod because we know the founders of Prod. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2983.8399999999997s)]
*  We know, like, kind of all the little clubs and things around Boston here. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2986.52s)]
*  And that's where we met them. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2990.56s)]
*  And then, yeah, first money in and then what was about [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2991.6s)]
*  what was the valuation at that point? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2994.24s)]
*  Just to make it clear, it was like 30 million plus or minus. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2995.6s)]
*  So what's your latest valuation? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=2999.28s)]
*  They were they got to revenue very quickly, by the way, latest valuation. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3002.64s)]
*  So they they closed a two billion dollar value around two months ago. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3006.0s)]
*  Heard rumors this week that they're looking at an eight billion or so [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3010.4s)]
*  preemptive term sheet, which they may or may not choose. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3014.0s)]
*  It's eight or ten. No one knows quite sure. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3017.12s)]
*  So that's a like a five step up in two months. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3019.84s)]
*  But Brendan, answer your age question. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3022.6800000000003s)]
*  I think he was 18, 19 when we first met him. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3024.7200000000003s)]
*  When you had him on stage in L.A., remember, he told that story. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3027.76s)]
*  He had just raised the 300 million dollar value funding. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3031.8s)]
*  And he wanted to meet him at a bar. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3034.48s)]
*  And he said, well, I can't meet you at a bar. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3037.0s)]
*  And they said, why not? You don't drink. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3038.76s)]
*  I said, well, I'm only a little bit older. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3040.84s)]
*  So he is such an inspiration for everyone around our ecosystem now. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3044.36s)]
*  And everybody knows his name. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3050.6s)]
*  It's just it's just so cool to watch. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3052.92s)]
*  I mean, just again, for for our fans listening here, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3054.84s)]
*  the story is that we're going to see such an explosion of entrepreneurship [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3059.2400000000002s)]
*  at the younger ages. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3064.7200000000003s)]
*  Why? I think for a few reasons. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3066.7200000000003s)]
*  Number one, they're unconstrained thinking. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3068.32s)]
*  They have nothing to lose, nothing to lose. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3071.92s)]
*  Number two, they've got the tools with vibe coding [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3074.36s)]
*  and with access to these large language models to iterate [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3078.28s)]
*  and rapidly build stuff and throw it against the wall. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3082.2s)]
*  Any other reasons why that's happening? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3086.3999999999996s)]
*  For me, those are the top two. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3088.8399999999997s)]
*  So many of the people that we run into are worried about losing their job, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3090.0s)]
*  losing their career, losing their whatever, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3093.7999999999997s)]
*  rather than jumping in the huge into the huge opportunity that opened up [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3096.96s)]
*  because you get invested in your career, you get invested in your job, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3101.48s)]
*  you get invested in learning. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3104.2s)]
*  But if you unconstrained yourself from all that baggage [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3105.24s)]
*  and just just think from a clean sheet of paper, you know, when you're [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3108.2s)]
*  when you're 18, 19 years old, you have the benefit of you don't have a job. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3111.44s)]
*  So there's nothing to worry about. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3115.48s)]
*  But everybody could do that, right? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3117.44s)]
*  You're not you're not actually constrained. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3119.16s)]
*  You just feel like you are. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3121.52s)]
*  It's the analogy I use is like a two year old skiing, right? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3123.0s)]
*  They have no fear because they only have this far to fall. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3126.6s)]
*  You get older, you get taller, you've got a lot further for you [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3130.7200000000003s)]
*  going to break a leg or something, and you don't have that for the fall. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3133.04s)]
*  And it's the same type of mentality. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3135.68s)]
*  I remember me meeting this young kid who was the founder of Arbitrum, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3138.0s)]
*  which is one of the layer two blockchains. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3140.96s)]
*  Right. And he and he was asked, well, why do you think you'd succeed? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3143.2s)]
*  Why not build your own L1 rather than and why would you go with Ethereum [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3147.32s)]
*  as a layer one as opposed to one of the others, etc, etc. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3151.04s)]
*  And he says to me, well, according to your exponential organizations book, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3154.84s)]
*  a new innovation has to be 10x better than a marketplace. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3158.84s)]
*  Right. And therefore we figured these other ones are 2x better than Ethereum, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3162.16s)]
*  but they're not 10x better. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3166.4s)]
*  And the ecosystem of developers in there. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3167.84s)]
*  So we decided to layer on Ethereum. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3169.8s)]
*  And I was like, wait, is this kid quoting my own book back at me? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3171.76s)]
*  It's like, how, like, so I'm so impressed with this younger generation of founders, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3176.0400000000004s)]
*  where they got this whole. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3180.92s)]
*  I think a third reason is they're digitally native in a way that a 50 year old is just not. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3182.32s)]
*  Right. They live and breathe this stuff. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3187.0800000000004s)]
*  So it's really a key part of this whole thing. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3189.6400000000003s)]
*  Also, you know, a lot of the, a lot of the really successful new companies, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3192.5200000000004s)]
*  they have very specific recruiting domains where they're pulling their best friends in [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3196.88s)]
*  or they're people they know. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3201.0s)]
*  And when you happen to be that age, all of your best friends are also not doing anything. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3202.52s)]
*  So it's a lot harder when you're older to go to that. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3206.8s)]
*  Like if you think of the 10 people you would most want to work with [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3208.84s)]
*  and you get really excited about it, nine of those 10 are going to be unavailable today [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3211.8s)]
*  because of some bonus cycle or whatever. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3215.6800000000003s)]
*  Case in point. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3219.4s)]
*  Yeah, you guys are all busy on podcasts. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3220.32s)]
*  This podcast right now, right? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3222.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's like when I reached out to you, Dave and Salim and said, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3223.76s)]
*  let's do this this weekly WTF episode together, you both said yes. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3228.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's been a blast. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3233.84s)]
*  I mean, I look forward to this every single week to have this conversation. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3235.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but let's note the scheduling. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3238.6000000000004s)]
*  These things is like Haley's Comet coming around, right? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3239.96s)]
*  It's like a nightmare between our schedules for sure. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3242.7200000000003s)]
*  But we're committed to it. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3246.2000000000003s)]
*  Core points. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3247.32s)]
*  We'll talk about it some other podcast, but he has a really good set of core points [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3248.76s)]
*  that was in our little newsfeed here. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3252.16s)]
*  One of them, though, is you have a lot of things in your life that you can cut. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3254.3599999999997s)]
*  And if you're honest with yourself and you look at them [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3258.8799999999997s)]
*  to make space for what's going on right here, you're going to have to cut something else. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3262.92s)]
*  Yeah. Look objectively at your life and think, OK, something I cut. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3266.6s)]
*  I cut sleep. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3270.2s)]
*  No, unfortunately, at least this morning, I did the prep for this podcast. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3273.2s)]
*  All right. The talent war remains on. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3277.8399999999997s)]
*  So, you know, just want to lay this out because it's ongoing. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3280.68s)]
*  And when we think about sort of what are the constraints on this gen AI revolution, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3285.8399999999997s)]
*  we talk about chips as a constraint, we talk about power as a constraint. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3291.44s)]
*  It's talent. Talent right now is is the constraint. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3295.48s)]
*  Right. So Metta offers huge 100 million dollar comp packages. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3299.8399999999997s)]
*  Zuckerberg himself is going out and and finding people and bringing them in. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3304.72s)]
*  OpenAI is giving 10 to 20 million dollar equity on top of Google and anthropic hires. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3310.36s)]
*  I love this. OpenAI spent four point four billion in stock based compensation. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3317.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. It's more than their compute is costing them. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3322.76s)]
*  They're spending on on talent. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3327.04s)]
*  I want to quote a few things here just for people to get a sense. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3330.56s)]
*  If you believe that access to AI is, in fact, the single differentiator that's going to [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3334.2000000000003s)]
*  or to the next levels of AI, AGI, ASI, whatever, it's going to differentiate all of these hyperscalers. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3341.6000000000004s)]
*  Then it's the single most important thing they can do. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3350.52s)]
*  So Metta is at one point three five trillion. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3352.96s)]
*  They have 58 billion dollars of cash on hand and they're going to spend that. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3356.1200000000003s)]
*  Google's at two point two trillion. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3360.88s)]
*  They have 101 billion dollars of cash on hand. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3362.56s)]
*  Right. OpenAI is at three hundred billion dollars. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3366.36s)]
*  The estimate is they've got about 20 billion of cash on hand. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3369.16s)]
*  Microsoft's at three point two with 78 billion cash on hand. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3372.56s)]
*  Anthropic is at sixty one billion with about three to five billion of cash on hand. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3375.88s)]
*  So I just want to make the point that there's a lot of cash on the balance sheets of these companies. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3380.56s)]
*  And this is an existential risk if they don't acquire the best talent today. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3385.92s)]
*  This is a complaint. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3391.68s)]
*  This is a bit of complaint on Apple because they've got like unbelievable amounts on their balance sheet [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3393.48s)]
*  and have cash and they're just not using it. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3397.92s)]
*  And it's a huge problem. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3400.24s)]
*  By the way, can I point out something on this slide? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3402.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3404.68s)]
*  Look at how much Metta has spent on AI on that third bullet point, which says aggressive spending of the impacted margin [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3405.3599999999997s)]
*  going from 28 to 23 percent. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3411.04s)]
*  I'm like boo, boo hoo. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3413.4s)]
*  I mean, any company would kill to spend that much money and then your margins are impacted by five percent. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3415.68s)]
*  You're kidding me. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3421.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3422.84s)]
*  Well, point being, there's a lot more room to go. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3424.4s)]
*  And, you know, as things heat up, they probably will. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3426.64s)]
*  Do you remember a few years ago, they were all talking about doing dividends. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3429.76s)]
*  They couldn't think of what to do with their money. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3433.48s)]
*  So much of it. Hey, why don't we just do a dividend like a bloated old bank or car manufacturer? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3435.56s)]
*  It's just such a different world today from just four years ago. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3442.2400000000002s)]
*  But I want I want people to hear, expect that there's going to be outlandish spending to get the talent. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3445.2400000000002s)]
*  And then once they've got what they can get, spending on on energy and then spending on building. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3453.56s)]
*  You know, we mentioned before that this year is about a billion dollars a day being put into into the AI arena. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3463.28s)]
*  And we expect by 2030, it will triple to a trillion dollars a year. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3472.2799999999997s)]
*  Anyway, it's it's insane. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3477.8399999999997s)]
*  We've also seen this in Saudi and Emirates and so forth. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3479.16s)]
*  I don't know what happened with Mark Zuckerberg, but he woke up one morning and said, you know what, we're going to win this race. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3482.2799999999997s)]
*  And so he has built an incredible dream team in no time. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3487.04s)]
*  But the top offer, it turned out, was a billion. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3491.96s)]
*  Remember, we were talking a week ago about a hundred million dollars offers. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3495.56s)]
*  And since then, we discovered that no, that was actually there were several of those for sure. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3499.84s)]
*  But then there was a one billion dollar offer that got turned down. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3505.88s)]
*  And that's just that's a person who also has a team that would have come over. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3509.7200000000003s)]
*  But that person, you know. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3513.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I think the key thing there is they turned it down. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3515.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, this is when Palmer Lucky, this is unbelievable. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3519.0400000000004s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3521.6400000000003s)]
*  He turned down a billion dollars. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3522.5200000000004s)]
*  He turned down a billion dollars. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3524.52s)]
*  He turned down a billion dollars. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3526.96s)]
*  The first offer that that Zuckerberg made for his his VR. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3528.56s)]
*  There's a really important point to be made here, right? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3534.28s)]
*  If you're going to be building one of these companies, you have an MTP, you have a massive transformative purpose, and you're really keen on that. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3536.48s)]
*  And you're driven by the passion and the emotion. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3542.52s)]
*  Peter, you talk about the emotional engagement that that brings to people. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3544.64s)]
*  I remember Yan Kuhn, when they when Mark, when Zuckerberg and tried to buy WhatsApp, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3548.56s)]
*  the actual valuation was about one and a half billion. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3553.12s)]
*  And so they made they started having a discussion and very quickly Apple and Google and others came to the table. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3556.12s)]
*  So the valuation kept going up and he kept just kept saying no, because if I get acquired, my MTP gets threatened, which was simple communications globally. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3561.6s)]
*  And I don't want to only after like at 18 billion is the rest of a shareholder said, come on. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3569.4s)]
*  And then after extracting a promise that Zuck would not touch the company or obtain anything for five years, did he go, OK, fine. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3575.76s)]
*  Right. And that's I think that's what's amazing about MTPs and the founder mentality. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3583.4s)]
*  That's the same situation that Palmer Lucky talked about on stage at the last year. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3588.12s)]
*  Right. He said no to a billion. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3593.6400000000003s)]
*  He finally accepted two point two billion, but only after Zuckerberg agreed to spend like a billion a year on the whole metaverse activity. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3596.84s)]
*  And he ended up spending like 50 billion instead. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3605.8s)]
*  I would love the framing he put on that saying if I wanted if I'm excited about the domain and I want trying to get 10 billion of investment and do it, it would take me forever because I'd have to go raise that money. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3607.88s)]
*  And so therefore, by doing it this way, I got Facebook to invest our meta to put that money in and the whole place exploded, which is amazing. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3617.8s)]
*  Yeah. Quick story for you on why these numbers are so big. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3625.2400000000002s)]
*  And this is this is hearsay, but I'm pretty sure it's accurate. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3629.88s)]
*  You know how, you know, if you're an open user, nobody uses GPT four point five, which was supposed to be a big deal. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3632.3999999999996s)]
*  We're still on four or three, which is using four or four one under the covers. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3637.8799999999997s)]
*  But what happened to four or five? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3642.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, it was a multi hundred million dollar training run. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3643.52s)]
*  Turns out there was a bug, probably a single code in Pytorch. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3647.92s)]
*  And the thing was just grinding using a compute. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3653.12s)]
*  But and, you know, they thought that was making forward progress, but it wasn't for a long time. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3656.08s)]
*  Probably. Wow. And yeah, towards the whole training run. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3660.6000000000004s)]
*  And that's that's why GPT four point five has been a disappointment. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3664.48s)]
*  So then you're like, OK, why would I spend a billion dollars or a hundred million on a single person? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3668.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, if it's the right person, the next training runs are going to be much bigger than the last ones. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3673.0800000000004s)]
*  And there's a lot of room to optimize, improve and avoid bugs in that process. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3678.0400000000004s)]
*  So these are really rare, super valuable human beings at this point in time. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3682.2000000000003s)]
*  Amazing. I don't see how long. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3686.6800000000003s)]
*  Why can't you just say to the AI itself, go find the bugs in your code? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3688.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's that's certainly going to be the truth. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3692.24s)]
*  It's not there here. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3696.64s)]
*  And yeah, the rate blitz is moving within a year for sure. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3698.44s)]
*  A quick aside, you probably heard me speaking about fountain life before. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3701.96s)]
*  And you're probably wishing, Peter, would you please stop talking about fountain life? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3705.52s)]
*  And the answer is no, I won't, because generally we're living through a health care crisis. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3709.24s)]
*  You may not know this, but 70 percent of heart attacks have no precinct, no pain, no shortness of breath. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3714.2799999999997s)]
*  And half of those people with a heart attack never wake up. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3719.52s)]
*  You don't feel cancer until stage three or stage four, until it's too late. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3722.08s)]
*  But we have all the technology required to detect and prevent these diseases early at scale. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3726.72s)]
*  That's why a group of us, including Tony Robbins, Bill Capp and Bob Haruri, founded Fountain Life, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3732.24s)]
*  a one stop center to help people understand what's going on inside their bodies before it's too late [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3737.3199999999997s)]
*  and to gain access to the therapeutics to give them decades of extra health span. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3743.04s)]
*  Learn more about what's going on inside your body from Fountain Life. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3747.36s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com slash Peter and tell them Peter sent you. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3750.2s)]
*  OK, back to the episode. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3754.56s)]
*  All right. We mentioned last week that Dan Daniel Gross, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3756.44s)]
*  who was the CEO of Ilya Setskever's company, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3761.4s)]
*  Safe Superintelligence, had been poached by Metta. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3765.68s)]
*  And now Ilya has jumped into the seat of CEO. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3769.2s)]
*  It says that Zach has upped the number of researchers poached to 11, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3773.12s)]
*  coming from the buzziest and earliest AI native firms, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3777.72s)]
*  And this is part of a major reorganization that puts Alexander Wang and Nat Friedman, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3782.6s)]
*  two of the highest profile hires of the past few weeks, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3786.8s)]
*  at the head of a new group at Metta called Superintelligence Labs. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3789.88s)]
*  But what may be the most critical part of this memo? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3793.7599999999998s)]
*  Zuckerberg writing that, quote, as the pace of AI progress accelerates, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3796.52s)]
*  superintelligence is coming into sight. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3800.56s)]
*  A source confirms Wires reporting that OpenAI's chief research officer described it as, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3803.6800000000003s)]
*  quote, someone has broken into our home and stolen something. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3808.8s)]
*  He vowed to be proactive, creative, recalibrate, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3812.28s)]
*  comp to recognize and reward top talent. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3815.2000000000003s)]
*  Like Kelly, Zuckerberg reaching superintelligence before Altman does. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3817.8s)]
*  That would be like taking over the whole house itself. Yeah. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3823.0s)]
*  Is that memo over 10? You can't quite tell from the way she describes it. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3826.84s)]
*  So an interesting point on that CNBC clip is the notion that the conversation has slowly slipped from AGI [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3832.32s)]
*  to superintelligence over and over again. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3843.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm super happy for that because the theme of the abundance summit in March of 26 is [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3845.76s)]
*  digital superintelligence and the rise of humanoid robots. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3853.96s)]
*  So got that one right. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3856.68s)]
*  But the question is what in the world is superintelligence, right? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3857.64s)]
*  This definitional problem. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3862.84s)]
*  That's the Salim soapbox, right? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3864.76s)]
*  Like what the hell are we talking about here? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3866.68s)]
*  Can anybody come up with a clear definition of this? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3868.32s)]
*  Well, the closest one I can. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3870.36s)]
*  Actually, I'd like an invitation to the viewers. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3871.36s)]
*  If anybody sees a good definition of ASI or AGI or anything, please help us out here because nobody has one. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3873.32s)]
*  The one that I've heard that I just put out. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3880.48s)]
*  So I put out a newsletter every week, twice a week, and I just put one out on superintelligence. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3883.2s)]
*  And the definition is an AI system that is smarter than any human and anything. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3889.9199999999996s)]
*  So we'll see if that stands. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3901.48s)]
*  I mean, it blurs with AGI, but sure, would love a better definition. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3903.72s)]
*  Dave, do you have one? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3909.7599999999998s)]
*  You like? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3910.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, no. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3911.52s)]
*  And does it matter? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3912.92s)]
*  Oh, we totally know. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3915.04s)]
*  So look, what's happening obviously is that superintelligence is happening in all these domains already and has been for a while, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3915.76s)]
*  like protein folding and speaking any language and singing in seven or 20 different octaves and like all these things that are so totally superhuman are happening. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3923.32s)]
*  And then this little area of reasoning and creativity, the AI can't do it yet, which to me is a perfect period of time. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3932.44s)]
*  You have an incredible purpose to serve with the AI to build great things together. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3940.3199999999997s)]
*  So it's actually a very golden moment and we shouldn't be cheering for AGI. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3946.08s)]
*  But it is a sweet spot. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3950.9199999999996s)]
*  Like everybody is thinking, oh, it becomes human like and then it becomes superhuman. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3952.9199999999996s)]
*  It's not like that. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3956.68s)]
*  It's way past us in some areas and behind us and others. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3957.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's a good thing. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3961.48s)]
*  We should be cheering for that to stay that way for a while. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3962.7999999999997s)]
*  I would be very happy if it stayed where it is for a while. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3966.52s)]
*  I agree with you on that front. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3972.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3973.12s)]
*  Can I give you my view on this? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3974.12s)]
*  Of course. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3976.16s)]
*  I always love your view. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3976.6s)]
*  I think it's going to stay at this level, this paradigm for a long time to come. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3977.12s)]
*  OK, I'm going to take the other side of that bet, Salim. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3981.6s)]
*  Please, let's do that. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3984.08s)]
*  First, for God's sake, somebody define it for me. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3985.16s)]
*  Sorry, soapbox over. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3987.84s)]
*  That's why I'm taking the bet. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3990.2400000000002s)]
*  Hey, well, back on the meta hires though, talk about a dream team now. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3991.72s)]
*  So Mark can get on stage now with Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross and Alexander Wang. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=3995.4s)]
*  You compare that to a month ago. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4001.56s)]
*  What an incredible dream. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4003.16s)]
*  We had two of them on stage at the Abundance Summit two years ago, which was fun. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4005.72s)]
*  All right. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4014.2s)]
*  You should, for every time you put somebody on stage, you should get 10% of their future earnings. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4014.96s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4019.6s)]
*  We would start having trillion dollar X prizes being launched very shortly thereafter. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4021.72s)]
*  So this is a fun one. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4027.3599999999997s)]
*  Looking at practical applications of AI, we're talking about all the theoretical stuff. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4029.04s)]
*  Google launches Doppel, and I'll run the video here, which is silent, which is a new app [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4032.3999999999996s)]
*  that lets you virtually try on any outfit to see how it might look on you. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4037.72s)]
*  So I love this. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4044.0s)]
*  I hate going to a store and trying stuff on. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4045.7999999999997s)]
*  The fact of the matter is the future of all clothes shopping, at least for guys, may be [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4049.56s)]
*  very different for women, is I take a body map, which is very easy to do actually with [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4054.24s)]
*  your phone, and you upload it. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4060.04s)]
*  And then you can actually probably employ any of the great fashion designers as AIs. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4062.36s)]
*  I'm going to this party this time of year in this city. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4069.96s)]
*  What are the five outfits you recommend for me? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4075.0s)]
*  I see a fashion show of five avatars walking on the stage who are wearing five different [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4077.32s)]
*  things who look exactly like me, and I say, that's the one I want. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4083.32s)]
*  And it's shipped, custom fit, I get it the next day. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4087.32s)]
*  That's the future. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4091.32s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4092.32s)]
*  I think the future is one step further than that. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4093.92s)]
*  Which is, I'd like an AI to kind of go, you know, for the shape of your head and your [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4097.32s)]
*  jawline, this is the type of call that looks best on you. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4101.04s)]
*  We're just shipping you a bunch of stuff that's going to look good on you. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4103.8s)]
*  You can't pick this stuff out for yourself, you're just not good enough. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4106.72s)]
*  So we're going to pick it out for you, and we're just going to ship it to you on a rent-the-runway [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4109.72s)]
*  thing but all driven by AI, and the clothes just arrive, and I just put them on. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4114.240000000001s)]
*  How about if you give your AI a budget per month, and you say I'm giving you a $2,000 [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4118.72s)]
*  surprise and delight budget. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4125.68s)]
*  You know what I like, you're seeing all of my texts and my emails, and you're listening [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4128.08s)]
*  to my conversations. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4133.56s)]
*  So just have fun, surprise and delight me every day, you got $2,000 a month to play [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4134.56s)]
*  with. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4140.56s)]
*  We're similar for vacations and activities. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4141.56s)]
*  It's not all about physical stuff coming to your door. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4145.96s)]
*  It's what are you doing with your life today? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4148.280000000001s)]
*  Where are you going? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4150.68s)]
*  Here or there? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4151.68s)]
*  Could you imagine an AI that say, okay, I've got the weekend off, plan something amazing [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4152.96s)]
*  for me, and it goes, sure, their car will pick you up at 9 a.m. at your doorstep, and [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4161.28s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you what you're doing, but it's going to be an incredible two days. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4167.719999999999s)]
*  I would love that. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4170.8s)]
*  It's like a surprise and delight adventure. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4171.8s)]
*  That'd be so awesome. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4173.92s)]
*  Can I propose a startup idea for the three of us? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4174.92s)]
*  Sure, of course. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4177.24s)]
*  You've got the reach, Peter. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4178.24s)]
*  Dave, you've got the funds. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4179.8s)]
*  We have the team. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4180.88s)]
*  We could do this in two seconds. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4182.259999999999s)]
*  It's an Amazon Prime for living an amazing life. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4183.679999999999s)]
*  You pay a subscription fee of some number, $50 a month or whatever, and an AI-driven [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4187.799999999999s)]
*  environment learns about you and does stuff like what you just mentioned, Peter. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4192.36s)]
*  It says, we know you're free on Saturday night, and you have date night, and your kid's away [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4196.32s)]
*  at camp. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4200.639999999999s)]
*  This is what you're doing this Saturday night. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4201.639999999999s)]
*  Be ready at this point. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4203.16s)]
*  I love this. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4204.16s)]
*  That surprise and delight is something that people ... Something about these subscription [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4205.16s)]
*  services, you never ever, ever, ever unsubscribe. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4210.16s)]
*  As long as you're delivering some serendipity now and then, you're off to the races. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4212.919999999999s)]
*  You could just create a serendipity AI that just delivers magical experiences on a subscription [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4217.44s)]
*  model. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4224.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4225.32s)]
*  I agree with you, Sleeve. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4226.32s)]
*  Let's keep this secret. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4227.32s)]
*  Let's not tell anybody about this idea. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4228.32s)]
*  The problem is, we all have so many ideas to build. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4229.32s)]
*  I just want to see that one built, right? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4233.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4235.5599999999995s)]
*  I would subscribe to that. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4236.5599999999995s)]
*  Actually, I think it's a fantastic idea. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4237.5599999999995s)]
*  Dave, what do you think? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4239.5599999999995s)]
*  I think I had this thought very related to this back when the Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4241.44s)]
*  edition came out. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4246.04s)]
*  I don't know if you remember that. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4247.04s)]
*  It's like Eddie Bauer. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4248.04s)]
*  Okay, that's outdoor clothing and stuff. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4249.52s)]
*  The self-image of that person is, look, I've got the Ford Explorer. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4253.44s)]
*  I've got my surfboard on the roof. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4257.28s)]
*  I've got my Eddie Bauer clothes. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4258.76s)]
*  This is my lifestyle and what I like to do in my self-image is this. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4259.76s)]
*  It cuts across cars and surfboards and clothes. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4264.6s)]
*  I think the AI version of that that you're describing, Salim, is a great idea. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4268.24s)]
*  It's definitely going to happen. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4272.8s)]
*  It's going to have different pathways for different types of people, outdoor person, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4273.8s)]
*  video game, whatever. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4281.52s)]
*  Also, you could build in the orthogonal aspects. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4283.52s)]
*  If you're an outdoor person a lot, go see a Broadway show once in a while just to break [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4287.400000000001s)]
*  the pattern and just add those extra dimensions to your day-to-day life that you wouldn't [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4291.64s)]
*  normally think of or do yourself. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4297.0s)]
*  So listen, if anybody ends up building this, at least let us know and give us a little [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4299.2s)]
*  bit of credit. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4304.48s)]
*  Give us a free subscription. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4305.48s)]
*  And if we end up building it... [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4307.48s)]
*  Hell no, we want equity. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4308.84s)]
*  Okay, we want equity. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4310.84s)]
*  Fine, we'll take it. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4312.36s)]
*  We'll take some advisory shares. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4314.08s)]
*  All right, let's move on here. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4315.6s)]
*  Here's another fun one. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4318.6s)]
*  This comes from Rolling Stone. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4319.76s)]
*  This was predictable and it's finally here. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4323.42s)]
*  So the band is called Velvet Sundown and they've amassed a million listeners in one month. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4326.84s)]
*  And here's the key point. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4336.88s)]
*  It's not a physical real band. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4338.68s)]
*  It's an AI with over 15,000 AI tracks per day are being uploaded to streaming services. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4340.88s)]
*  So if you're a Velvet Sundown band fan, let us know in the comments. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4346.84s)]
*  I think this is amazing. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4353.72s)]
*  And of course, what's going to follow this next is there are going to be virtualized [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4355.52s)]
*  concerts of these guys. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4359.2s)]
*  You'll see them on TV, on your eyewear, and you'll go to an event and they'll be performing [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4360.92s)]
*  and they'll be flying through the air because they're superhuman. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4367.360000000001s)]
*  Two things here. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4372.08s)]
*  One is I think this is awesome. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4373.16s)]
*  I went and actually listened to a couple of their songs. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4375.04s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4377.280000000001s)]
*  It's really, really very approachable music and it's really great. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4379.76s)]
*  My kind of holy grail here is to take a favorite old band of mine, I used to listen to Rush, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4384.84s)]
*  that old rock band from Canada, and compose me some new songs and have an AI version of [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4388.8s)]
*  the band compose and present those songs. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4394.719999999999s)]
*  It would be fantastic. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4396.48s)]
*  Yeah, another great idea. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4397.48s)]
*  Some of the rights owners get on board with what you just said because I want to do the [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4400.12s)]
*  exact same thing with some of the classics like Boston and Rush are phenomenal and you'd [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4402.88s)]
*  love to hear some new material. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4408.099999999999s)]
*  They're not, you know, Boston put out three albums and then Never Again. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4409.5599999999995s)]
*  Four. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4412.4s)]
*  They put out four. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4413.5199999999995s)]
*  Did they put out four? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4414.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a Boston fan. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4415.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like the one band. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4416.5199999999995s)]
*  I had one, I had two records through college. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4418.16s)]
*  I had Boston and I had Kansas. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4420.719999999999s)]
*  I mean I was a social ignoramus and I just played them over and over and over again. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4423.879999999999s)]
*  I still play them over and over and over again. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4430.5199999999995s)]
*  Stuff you don't want to know about me. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4432.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4436.599999999999s)]
*  So right now the rights owners are like, hey, let's sue the AI companies. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4437.599999999999s)]
*  Like, don't do that. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4440.44s)]
*  Get on board with it. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4441.44s)]
*  That's much better. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4442.48s)]
*  It would be such an amazing thing to do. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4443.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4445.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4446.759999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4447.759999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4448.759999999999s)]
*  We've been talking about all the upside. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4449.759999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about some of the concerns and this is Roman Yampolskly on Joe Rogan. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4451.4s)]
*  Alright, let's take a listen. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4459.839999999999s)]
*  Talking about super intelligence, a system which is thousands of times smarter than me. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4461.839999999999s)]
*  It would come up with something completely novel, more optimal, better way, more efficient [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4465.839999999999s)]
*  way of doing it. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4470.12s)]
*  And I cannot predict it because I'm not that smart. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4471.12s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4474.32s)]
*  We basically setting up adversarial situation with agents which are like squirrels versus [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4475.72s)]
*  humans. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4484.36s)]
*  No group of squirrels can figure out how to control us. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4485.36s)]
*  The more resources, more acorns, whatever, they're not going to solve that problem. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4487.96s)]
*  And it's the same for us. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4492.5199999999995s)]
*  And most people think one or two steps ahead and it's not enough. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4493.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not enough in chess. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4497.48s)]
*  It's not enough here. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4498.48s)]
*  If you think about AGI and then maybe super intelligence. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4499.92s)]
*  That's not the end of the game. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4503.08s)]
*  The process continues. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4504.4400000000005s)]
*  You will get super intelligence creating next level AI. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4505.4400000000005s)]
*  So super intelligence plus plus 2.0, 3.0. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4508.6s)]
*  It goes on indefinitely. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4512.32s)]
*  You're talking about super. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4514.36s)]
*  So it does go on. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4516.4800000000005s)]
*  It does go on indefinitely. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4518.4400000000005s)]
*  There is no ceiling on this. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4520.52s)]
*  Ray Kurzweil has talked about this many times. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4523.4800000000005s)]
*  That it will be as intelligent as human. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4528.52s)]
*  Then 10x, 100x, a thousand fold, a billion fold. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4531.16s)]
*  There is no upper limit. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4538.08s)]
*  So how do we deal with this? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4539.08s)]
*  Dave, you've had some ideas here. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4540.36s)]
*  You can put that video screenshot back on there. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4541.88s)]
*  I can figure out like this. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4544.8s)]
*  By the way, Roman is a singularity student. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4546.4s)]
*  I know him pretty well. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4549.28s)]
*  Very, very smart. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4550.599999999999s)]
*  But I disagree deeply with the conversation. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4551.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, me too, actually. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4554.5599999999995s)]
*  Me too. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4555.639999999999s)]
*  OK. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4556.2s)]
*  They're right fundamentally. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4557.5199999999995s)]
*  Self-improvement is imminent. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4558.599999999999s)]
*  And that's going to exponentially skyrocket [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4559.799999999999s)]
*  the capabilities. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4561.919999999999s)]
*  Where it's completely wrong is, look, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4563.919999999999s)]
*  every single iteration can be logged. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4567.08s)]
*  It is not a hard thing to do. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4570.4s)]
*  Also, the self-improvement can be [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4572.799999999999s)]
*  limited to the algorithmic self-improvement. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4575.04s)]
*  It doesn't have to be self-training. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4577.04s)]
*  The AI can say, hey, here's how I suggest I speed myself up, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4578.76s)]
*  or remap myself to faster hardware, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4583.0s)]
*  or get rid of operating system overhead [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4586.160000000001s)]
*  so that I run more efficiently. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4588.0s)]
*  Those suggestions are fine. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4589.6s)]
*  That self-improvement will really accelerate things. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4590.8s)]
*  There's no reason it needs to develop [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4594.0s)]
*  new internal capabilities blindly. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4597.120000000001s)]
*  That's a different loop. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4600.68s)]
*  And it's very controllable. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4601.96s)]
*  And so a lot of people in the research world are like, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4603.92s)]
*  well, look, if I deploy it in my car, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4606.52s)]
*  I want it to continue learning and improving its driving. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4608.88s)]
*  No, you don't. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4612.160000000001s)]
*  You want the debugged not self-improving thing [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4613.4800000000005s)]
*  to be driving your car, because it could do anything. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4616.240000000001s)]
*  And that's specifically what we never as humanity ever [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4620.280000000001s)]
*  need to cross that line. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4623.56s)]
*  There's no benefit to humanity to crossing that line. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4624.64s)]
*  But we keep crossing the lines. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4628.320000000001s)]
*  We set boundaries, and we keep crossing them. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4630.6s)]
*  Chat GPT or GPT 2 and 3 was not supposed [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4634.16s)]
*  to be put on the open web. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4637.92s)]
*  So you're right. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4642.08s)]
*  I mean, right now, look, the regulators have no idea [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4642.92s)]
*  what I just said, and no way to enact or interpret it. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4644.8s)]
*  And the people, there is a view of the world where, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4650.88s)]
*  you remember how we talked a week ago [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4655.0s)]
*  about five of the top AI guys just became [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4656.44s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonels in the Army. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4658.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4661.36s)]
*  So a model like that on this topic would actually work. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4662.2s)]
*  So there's a path forward. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4665.56s)]
*  But where we're sitting right now, you're right. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4666.84s)]
*  There's absolutely nobody even vaguely contemplating [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4668.92s)]
*  controls, just the process of logging exactly [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4671.64s)]
*  what it's doing, so easy to do. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4675.400000000001s)]
*  And then the metrics, the measurement of the logs, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4678.56s)]
*  everyone would be like, oh my god, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4680.88s)]
*  that's terabytes of data. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4681.76s)]
*  Who's going to look at it? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4682.68s)]
*  The AI will look at it. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4683.52s)]
*  You don't have to worry about that. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4684.36s)]
*  You just have an AI check of the AI logs [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4685.76s)]
*  and have that report to the regulators. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4688.68s)]
*  This is over the self-improvement line. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4691.56s)]
*  We need to stop it. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4694.320000000001s)]
*  And it's just improving its own algorithm, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4695.88s)]
*  making it faster, this is fine. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4698.08s)]
*  A quick thought on this? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4700.04s)]
*  So I think there's an important point that Dave made, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4701.56s)]
*  which is that if you have a bounded system [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4705.360000000001s)]
*  like self-driving, you want the AI to be bounded. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4707.68s)]
*  You don't want the AI to see a tree and say, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4710.96s)]
*  instead of driving around that tree, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4712.56s)]
*  let me try and drive up the tree and see what happens. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4713.76s)]
*  Why not? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4716.72s)]
*  We're experimental after all. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4717.68s)]
*  So you want some bounded conditions, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4719.68s)]
*  which I think is easy to program in. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4721.280000000001s)]
*  I think as Dave talks about the logging of the steps, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4723.08s)]
*  that's also very easy to do. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4726.16s)]
*  I think where I would get to would be, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4727.8s)]
*  show me the boundary condition. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4729.88s)]
*  And I think there is a safeguard. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4731.76s)]
*  And the safeguard is that these systems are not cognitive [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4733.360000000001s)]
*  and they're not self-aware. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4737.04s)]
*  If they develop self-awareness and a deep sense of self [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4738.72s)]
*  with their own sense of agency [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4741.64s)]
*  and internal model of themselves. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4743.52s)]
*  We're cooked. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4745.4400000000005s)]
*  That's when, not cooked, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4746.280000000001s)]
*  I think that's when you kind of go, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4747.88s)]
*  okay, now we need to deal with that. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4749.2s)]
*  And let's think about that. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4751.0s)]
*  The problem is we don't have a task for it [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4751.92s)]
*  and we don't have a definition for what that looks like. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4753.96s)]
*  I often joke that I feel like, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4756.5199999999995s)]
*  you look like you're self-aware, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4757.8s)]
*  so I attribute self-awareness to you. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4759.0s)]
*  I joke that I feel like I'm self-aware, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4761.44s)]
*  but my wife disagrees. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4763.04s)]
*  And so it's hard to even have the conversation [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4764.44s)]
*  around some of these topics. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4766.639999999999s)]
*  We get stuck in the language problem. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4767.72s)]
*  We have no idea what we're talking about [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4769.76s)]
*  when you talk about this. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4771.8s)]
*  And then you get into the philosophical stuff [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4773.0s)]
*  about the hard problem of subjective consciousness [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4775.0s)]
*  as Dave Chalmers has defined. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4778.48s)]
*  We have no sense of what we're talking about here. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4780.24s)]
*  So to freak out, I think is overstated by a thing. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4782.5199999999995s)]
*  We naturally go down and anthropomorphize the outcomes. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4786.759999999999s)]
*  And as Roman says, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4790.32s)]
*  that there'll be an adversarial relationship. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4792.4s)]
*  And I just don't see why that would be the case. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4795.0s)]
*  I say we're cooked because if they are conscious, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4797.959999999999s)]
*  there's gonna be a sense of self-preservation. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4800.24s)]
*  Anyway, let's move on to a few areas. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4802.959999999999s)]
*  I love that. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4806.639999999999s)]
*  There's no way, people are like, yeah, we're cooked. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4807.919999999999s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4810.4s)]
*  So I wanna get to the science breakthroughs [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4811.839999999999s)]
*  that are coming out because they're important. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4815.639999999999s)]
*  And I don't wanna go through Dave Blunden's sort of end time. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4817.719999999999s)]
*  So AI job battles. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4823.44s)]
*  So Amazon CEO says AI will take some jobs, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4826.16s)]
*  but make others more interesting. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4829.5199999999995s)]
*  Totally agree with him. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4831.599999999999s)]
*  This is the scorecard thus far in the first half of 2025. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4834.12s)]
*  AI has already replaced 94,000 tech workers. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4839.5199999999995s)]
*  And we'll see where it goes. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4844.679999999999s)]
*  And the question is, that's not a huge number. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4846.0s)]
*  It's significant. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4849.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's between one and three. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4850.36s)]
*  It's not that many, but it's an exponential. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4852.16s)]
*  Let's take a look at the next one. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4855.639999999999s)]
*  So Vinod Khosla, who is a friend, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4856.76s)]
*  had him on stage at the Abundance Summit last year, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4862.0s)]
*  said AI will replace 80% of jobs by 2030. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4865.0s)]
*  So this is when it starts to become interesting. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4868.24s)]
*  80% of jobs by 2030. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4871.56s)]
*  He's saying, hey, humanoid robots [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4874.2s)]
*  are gonna hit their chat GPT moment. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4876.92s)]
*  In two to three years, they're available for you [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4879.96s)]
*  at 300 bucks a month, which is $10 a day. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4882.96s)]
*  AI healthcare could become free [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4887.88s)]
*  if the regulators got out of the way. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4889.88s)]
*  By 2040, people will work out of passion, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4891.5199999999995s)]
*  not necessarily, not necessity in an era of abundance. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4895.2s)]
*  I completely agree with all of these. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4898.959999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure about the 80% figure. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4901.879999999999s)]
*  The question is, is that a scare tactic? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4903.919999999999s)]
*  I deeply disagree. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4904.759999999999s)]
*  You totally disagree. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4906.639999999999s)]
*  Just because I joined, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4907.48s)]
*  I kind of align with Eric Brynjolfsson on this, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4908.32s)]
*  because if you take a job like financial analyst, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4910.799999999999s)]
*  it's not one singular job. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4913.759999999999s)]
*  It's broken down to about 27 different tasks [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4915.44s)]
*  that that person does to fulfill that job function. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4918.24s)]
*  You might automate 10 out of those 27, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4921.84s)]
*  but you're not automating the rest. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4923.84s)]
*  And we've seen this throughout history. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4925.599999999999s)]
*  We automate bits of it, but the job still stays. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4926.92s)]
*  We just augment capability and we're able to do much more. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4929.92s)]
*  And AI with a chat bot that can do customer service [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4932.44s)]
*  can now focus on the really hard customers [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4935.92s)]
*  that need the in-person human touch [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4937.96s)]
*  and leave the AI to deal with all the level one, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4940.48s)]
*  level two support issues. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4942.72s)]
*  Well, you know what the good thing is, Slim? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4943.8s)]
*  We're gonna find out pretty fast. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4945.8s)]
*  Very fast. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4947.96s)]
*  And I think I'm happy to put a bet on this one [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4948.8s)]
*  if anybody wants to go against me on this one. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4951.52s)]
*  A 2030 or something? [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4953.44s)]
*  So on our Moonshots website, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4954.96s)]
*  we need to keep track of our bets [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4958.32s)]
*  and put some cashis against them. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4960.56s)]
*  All right, here's Mark Benioff. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4964.28s)]
*  I love Mark. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4966.36s)]
*  Mark is brilliant. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4967.18s)]
*  He's one of the most extraordinary philanthropists. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4968.04s)]
*  I'm not sure about the fashion statement here. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4971.4800000000005s)]
*  It looks kind of sci-fi. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4973.64s)]
*  He looks like Emperor Palpatine. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4974.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4978.0s)]
*  So this is from CNBC AI. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4979.16s)]
*  But a benevolent one. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4981.0s)]
*  A benevolent one. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4981.84s)]
*  He's a gem of a human being. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4982.68s)]
*  That's how benevolent I look in that picture there. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4984.52s)]
*  That's true. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4986.8s)]
*  AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4988.12s)]
*  says CEO Mark Benioff. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4991.56s)]
*  That's pretty extraordinary. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4994.7s)]
*  Salesforce is targeting a billion active AI agents [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4996.12s)]
*  by the year's end. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=4999.12s)]
*  So he's really looking. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5000.72s)]
*  What I love about here, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5001.56s)]
*  what I love here is this is the model [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5002.88s)]
*  of disrupt yourself before somebody else disrupts you. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5005.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5007.4s)]
*  And it's a core mantra that we spout [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5008.44s)]
*  that you better, you are the disruptor, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5010.5599999999995s)]
*  you're disrupted, right? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5012.2s)]
*  There's no middle ground. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5013.32s)]
*  And this is a great example of somebody living that [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5014.24s)]
*  and saying, okay, we're just gonna disrupt ourselves [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5016.599999999999s)]
*  because we have to and there's an opportunity there. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5019.12s)]
*  But here's the point. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5021.2s)]
*  He can do that because he's a, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5022.08s)]
*  it's a founder-led tech forward CEO. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5024.16s)]
*  Agree. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5028.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5029.12s)]
*  Yeah, one other little nit on what Mark is doing so, so well. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5029.94s)]
*  You know, a lot of the doubters in AI investing [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5032.5599999999995s)]
*  a year or two ago are like, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5036.32s)]
*  well, look, there's a lot of venture-funded money coming in, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5037.12s)]
*  but where's the actual corporate money coming in? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5040.599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, of course they're very slow to react. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5045.0s)]
*  Mark said, you know what, we're not gonna wait around. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5046.759999999999s)]
*  We're gonna go out to all these companies, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5048.599999999999s)]
*  especially in insurance, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5050.44s)]
*  and we're just gonna AI-ify their operations for them. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5052.12s)]
*  So really, really got deep into just take over. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5056.5199999999995s)]
*  We're not just trying to sell you a software product. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5059.32s)]
*  We're actually gonna just revamp your whole organization. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5061.599999999999s)]
*  And that's worked really, really well for Salesforce [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5064.5199999999995s)]
*  because a lot of people are like, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5066.36s)]
*  how did they get so big? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5067.32s)]
*  They're worth 200 billion dollars. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5068.719999999999s)]
*  How did that happen? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5070.24s)]
*  I mean, listen, SaaS is up for disruption, right? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5071.08s)]
*  Software is a service and he is looking, like you said, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5075.4s)]
*  slim to disrupt himself before the entire industry does. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5079.04s)]
*  This is an important conversation here. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5084.32s)]
*  Don't wanna spend too much time on it, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5087.2s)]
*  but this is from Reforge. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5088.599999999999s)]
*  It says, product market fit collapse. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5089.839999999999s)]
*  Why your company could be next. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5091.919999999999s)]
*  So a company called Chegg, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5094.12s)]
*  lost 90% of its market cap in 2024 [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5095.76s)]
*  to chat GPT faster and cheaper use. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5098.8s)]
*  So when you put wrappers on top [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5104.2s)]
*  of these large language models, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5106.64s)]
*  you can get very rapidly disrupted. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5108.64s)]
*  And here's a list of some of the other companies. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5111.92s)]
*  Can we go back a slide here? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5116.04s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5117.44s)]
*  Just a shout out to Mikhail Munit [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5118.36s)]
*  from the OpenEXO community who pointed this article at us. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5119.92s)]
*  And this is a really important conversation, as you said, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5124.72s)]
*  because there's a huge number of companies [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5127.08s)]
*  which we're gonna talk about in the next slide [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5129.92s)]
*  where you're trumpling along with good product market fit. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5131.4400000000005s)]
*  You think you're doing very well [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5134.12s)]
*  and then boom, you get disrupted very. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5135.28s)]
*  Look at that chart, right? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5137.04s)]
*  That's an unbelievable drop in like zero time. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5138.84s)]
*  And that's gonna start to happen [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5142.4s)]
*  to a larger, larger group of companies. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5143.76s)]
*  And I love the fact that we have a list of potentials here. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5145.52s)]
*  And every CEO in the world needs to be watching out [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5148.08s)]
*  for this to say, am I next? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5151.16s)]
*  Because you are, it's not an if, it's a when. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5153.28s)]
*  You better be watching out for what's gonna disrupt you [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5155.88s)]
*  because this chart is gonna hit you [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5158.36s)]
*  if you're not employing these types of models yourself [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5160.28s)]
*  very, very quickly. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5162.96s)]
*  Every day I get the strangest compliment. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5164.28s)]
*  Someone will stop me and say, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5166.4s)]
*  Peter, you have such nice skin. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5167.759999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I never thought I'd hear that from anyone. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5170.16s)]
*  And honestly, I can't take the full credit. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5173.08s)]
*  All I do is use something called One Skin OS1 [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5175.099999999999s)]
*  twice a day, every day. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5178.32s)]
*  The company is built by four brilliant PhD women [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5180.16s)]
*  who identified a peptide [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5182.88s)]
*  that effectively reverses the age of your skin. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5184.6s)]
*  I love it. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5187.32s)]
*  And again, I use this twice a day, every day. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5188.14s)]
*  You can go to Oneskin.co and write Peter at checkout [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5191.36s)]
*  for a discount on the same product I use. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5194.74s)]
*  That's Oneskin.co and use the code Peter at checkout. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5197.26s)]
*  All right, back to the episode. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5201.6s)]
*  By the way, a call out to our listeners. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5203.6s)]
*  If you have a article or a chart or a news headline [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5204.92s)]
*  that you'd like us to talk about, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5211.0s)]
*  go ahead and stick it in the comments on this session. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5212.48s)]
*  We'll look at it for next session. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5215.639999999999s)]
*  And again, please invite friends to join us. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5217.639999999999s)]
*  My mission here is that we're giving a hopeful, compelling, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5220.639999999999s)]
*  an abundant vision of the future to countervail [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5224.08s)]
*  all the negative news out there in the world. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5226.86s)]
*  We're still on a negative story here, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5229.4s)]
*  but here are the companies at risk. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5230.799999999999s)]
*  Not negative, this is creative destruction, right? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5234.16s)]
*  It is. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5236.44s)]
*  This is like the reality of the future. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5237.28s)]
*  And it's an opportunity to reinvent these. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5239.759999999999s)]
*  Reddit, Quora, Medium, right? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5242.48s)]
*  Canva, Adobe Stock, SurveyMonkey, right? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5245.08s)]
*  I mean, oh my God, talk about old school. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5248.92s)]
*  Khan Academy, Quizlet, Wolfram Alpha, Wikipedia. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5251.96s)]
*  These are companies that are, you know, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5256.2s)]
*  companies well known by us today, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5259.6s)]
*  but may not exist in the next two or three years. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5261.18s)]
*  Comments, Dave, at all? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5264.96s)]
*  Steven Wolfram's a good friend and in our office a lot. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5266.88s)]
*  We should get him to comment. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5269.48s)]
*  I wouldn't have expected Wolfram Alpha to be on the list. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5270.88s)]
*  But you know, next after this, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5273.36s)]
*  this is a pretty straightforward analysis. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5275.2s)]
*  Then after this, you got all the white collar [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5277.36s)]
*  insurance type companies, financial services companies. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5279.0s)]
*  Banks, banks. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5281.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's the one I'd really be looking at. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5282.76s)]
*  They have a couple more years, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5285.24s)]
*  but they gotta get moving like now, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5287.4800000000005s)]
*  figure out what their role is in the world [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5290.24s)]
*  three, four, five years from now. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5292.16s)]
*  Can I just talk about that just for a second? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5294.2s)]
*  You can, of course. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5297.4400000000005s)]
*  The only thing that's saving both banks [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5298.28s)]
*  and insurance companies is the regulatory moat, right? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5300.36s)]
*  I talk to CEOs in that world and they're like, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5303.4s)]
*  oh, the regulators are a pain in the ass. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5306.04s)]
*  And I'm like, are you kidding? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5307.48s)]
*  They're your best friend. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5308.44s)]
*  They're holding the hoard of startup folks at the gate, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5309.36s)]
*  preventing them from disrupting the crap out of you [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5313.44s)]
*  because you're not doing anything around this for yourself. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5315.5199999999995s)]
*  You have to disrupt yourself. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5318.44s)]
*  And I think the regulatory barriers in both healthcare [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5319.84s)]
*  and in financial services are holding back these guys [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5323.2s)]
*  and it's preventing them from doing the disrupting. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5326.4s)]
*  How long is that moat for them? [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5328.839999999999s)]
*  Really simple. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5332.2s)]
*  Look at in the crypto world, look at DeFi, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5333.04s)]
*  decentralized finance, right? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5334.839999999999s)]
*  What's a retail bank? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5337.0s)]
*  A retail bank is just a centralized ledger [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5339.879999999999s)]
*  where it knows that you deposit $1,000 [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5342.0s)]
*  and we lent it to Dave over there. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5344.04s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5345.839999999999s)]
*  And we trust our life savings [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5346.679999999999s)]
*  to the security of that centralized ledger. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5347.5199999999995s)]
*  If I can decentralize that ledger, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5349.599999999999s)]
*  which is what DeFi is all about, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5351.32s)]
*  why do I need the retail bank? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5352.92s)]
*  So there's already huge amounts of transaction flows [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5355.2s)]
*  happening on these DeFi networks, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5357.8s)]
*  which will start to circumvent existing flows. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5359.84s)]
*  And as that happens more and more, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5362.88s)]
*  the centralized banks are going to be totally, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5366.16s)]
*  at least the retail banking part, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5368.44s)]
*  there's other functions, investment banking, et cetera, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5369.84s)]
*  which has much more human touch. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5372.96s)]
*  But all of that will get disrupted. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5374.72s)]
*  I would give it three years for retail banking. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5376.36s)]
*  Amazing, amazing. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5379.5599999999995s)]
*  All right, let's move on. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5380.599999999999s)]
*  One of my favorite subjects is breakthrough science. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5381.8s)]
*  I wanna call out a few of these. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5384.88s)]
*  So one of the areas, again, Ray Kurzweil, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5387.04s)]
*  my mentor, your mentor, Salim, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5390.08s)]
*  predicted by the mid 2030s, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5392.24s)]
*  we would have high bandwidth BCI. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5394.64s)]
*  And I was like, a decade ago, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5397.56s)]
*  I was like, really? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5399.84s)]
*  You really think we're gonna get there? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5401.32s)]
*  Well, so here's- [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5403.32s)]
*  How does he do it? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5404.16s)]
*  How does he do it? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5405.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5406.68s)]
*  You call me the emperor of exponentials, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5407.52s)]
*  he's the grand poobah. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5409.28s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5410.8s)]
*  Let's take a quick listen. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5412.28s)]
*  This is Neuralink's roadmap, right? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5413.4s)]
*  I wanna just point out there's, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5416.24s)]
*  I know of, in writing my next book with Steven Kotler, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5418.08s)]
*  which is called, We Are as God's Survival Guide [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5421.759999999999s)]
*  for the Age of Abundance, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5424.5599999999995s)]
*  we track sort of the top five or six companies in this field. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5425.96s)]
*  Neuralink is definitely one of them. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5429.799999999999s)]
*  But there are others that have the potential [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5432.48s)]
*  to do far more. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5434.759999999999s)]
*  But let's take a quick listen at what we should expect. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5436.2s)]
*  Next quarter, we're planning to implant [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5439.799999999999s)]
*  the speech cortex to directly decode attentive words [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5442.36s)]
*  from brain signals to speech. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5445.88s)]
*  And in 2026, not only are we going to triple [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5448.28s)]
*  the number of electrodes from 1,000 to 3,000 [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5451.2s)]
*  for more capabilities, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5454.68s)]
*  we're planning to have our first blind-sight participant [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5455.88s)]
*  to enable navigation. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5458.16s)]
*  Woo! [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5459.84s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5460.68s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5461.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5462.36s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5463.2s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5464.04s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5464.88s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5465.72s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5466.5599999999995s)]
*  And in 2027, we're going to continue increasing [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5467.4s)]
*  channel counts, probably another triple, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5468.88s)]
*  so 10,000 channels, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5470.68s)]
*  and also enable, for the first time, multiple implants. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5472.320000000001s)]
*  So not just one in motor cortex, speech cortex, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5476.0s)]
*  or visual cortex, but all of the above. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5478.52s)]
*  And finally, in 2028, our goal is to get to [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5480.88s)]
*  more than 25,000 channels per implant, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5483.400000000001s)]
*  have multiple of these, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5486.04s)]
*  have ability to access any part of the brain [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5487.400000000001s)]
*  for psychiatric conditions, pain, dysregulation, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5489.360000000001s)]
*  and also start to demonstrate what it would be like [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5492.72s)]
*  to actually integrate with AI. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5494.72s)]
*  So the other thing that this is going to enable [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5496.16s)]
*  is for you to occupy an optimist robot, right? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5498.92s)]
*  So you can see through its eyes, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5502.92s)]
*  you can listen through its ears, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5504.52s)]
*  you can feel what it feels and move around. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5506.84s)]
*  There's some good movies on that subject, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5510.24s)]
*  but this is moving fast. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5512.4400000000005s)]
*  And again, it's not the only company doing this. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5515.04s)]
*  There's Paradromix, there's Forrest, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5517.6s)]
*  there's Mary Lou Jepson with Open Water, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5520.92s)]
*  amazing companies out there, and super exciting. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5525.04s)]
*  One of the subjects we had at the Abundance Summit [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5528.719999999999s)]
*  a couple of years ago, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5531.12s)]
*  it was a conversation actually with Alex Wiesner Gross, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5532.5199999999995s)]
*  it was, are we gonna couple with AI, right? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5536.08s)]
*  So AI is growing exponentially. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5539.32s)]
*  We are, as humans, flat, linear or sub-linear in some cases. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5541.679999999999s)]
*  Can we couple with AI so as AI is moving, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5546.96s)]
*  we can move with it? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5550.2s)]
*  Can I say something here? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5552.599999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5554.48s)]
*  Is the actual massive, optimistic, hopeful benefit [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5555.32s)]
*  of technology where you augment the human experience, right? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5560.28s)]
*  Hollywood always has a dystopian Terminator, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5563.96s)]
*  Skynet, Matrix, Ruan Overlord has come [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5566.44s)]
*  and take over the world. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5569.0s)]
*  If we're lucky, we're pets, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5569.88s)]
*  and if we're unlucky, we're food. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5571.28s)]
*  You always see that outcome. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5572.92s)]
*  But you actually look how my smartphone [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5574.5599999999995s)]
*  augments my humanity, right? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5577.599999999999s)]
*  I have empathy built in, my memory's built in, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5579.16s)]
*  I have reach, et cetera. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5581.48s)]
*  I think the ability to project consciousness [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5583.36s)]
*  and awareness and human ability and empathy, et cetera, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5585.599999999999s)]
*  through other devices becomes the holy grail [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5588.5599999999995s)]
*  of where technology can take the human condition. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5591.44s)]
*  Yeah, beautiful. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5594.639999999999s)]
*  Very quickly, we're gonna see tech like this coming out. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5598.599999999999s)]
*  These are emotion tracking smart glasses. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5601.639999999999s)]
*  Apple has got smart glasses. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5604.88s)]
*  Google's got smart glasses. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5606.719999999999s)]
*  Meta's got smart glasses. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5608.719999999999s)]
*  And what we're gonna start to see, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5610.32s)]
*  finally, hopefully, it's the visual recognition. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5612.36s)]
*  When I see across the hall, my AI tells me, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5615.44s)]
*  oh, Salim is approaching you. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5618.08s)]
*  Remember, his son's name is Milan, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5619.32s)]
*  and he was born, his birthday's coming up. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5622.36s)]
*  And you basically have this ability [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5624.5599999999995s)]
*  to have a perfect memory for people, places, and things. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5626.24s)]
*  But also the idea of facial and biometric sensors. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5630.12s)]
*  So the fine muscle movements in the cheek and the eye [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5633.12s)]
*  that tells you this person is fearful or excited or lying. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5638.76s)]
*  I need one of these, [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5643.44s)]
*  because when you approach me, Peter, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5644.5199999999995s)]
*  you always have that look, like, Salim, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5645.92s)]
*  you didn't do this thing that I asked you to do. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5647.72s)]
*  So I'll be able to tell that beforehand. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5650.08s)]
*  I've kind of found this. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5653.08s)]
*  The point I wanna make about this one is [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5654.16s)]
*  each time we find a layer of capability [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5655.92s)]
*  and we get information to enable that [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5658.28s)]
*  and make that available to both computation and AI, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5659.96s)]
*  we have whole classes of applications [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5664.2s)]
*  that get unlocked at each of these. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5666.24s)]
*  Amazing stuff. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5668.04s)]
*  I think it's incredibly exciting [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5668.88s)]
*  about what's happening in the world. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5669.72s)]
*  The adjacencies. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5670.54s)]
*  Where information enabling all these different domains [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5671.38s)]
*  that we never thought possible around this. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5673.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5675.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, side conversation on this, we can have it later, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5676.56s)]
*  but this is definitely gonna happen. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5680.08s)]
*  It works really well. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5682.0s)]
*  The cameras are super, super high-def, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5682.84s)]
*  and they operate in frequencies that the human eye can't see. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5684.84s)]
*  So they're doing a tech to all kinds of things [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5687.96s)]
*  that you never knew you were telegraphing. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5689.52s)]
*  I think the recipient, the person in front of the camera, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5692.08s)]
*  has a basic human right to know when they're on camera. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5694.68s)]
*  And I think all these cameras should have built in [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5698.64s)]
*  transmission that identifies where they are [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5700.8s)]
*  and what they're looking at. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5703.64s)]
*  So you can have a little app on your phone saying, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5704.96s)]
*  oh, I'm being watched right now and just know. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5706.64s)]
*  And I think that's a quick fix. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5709.4400000000005s)]
*  But this is gonna happen no matter what. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5710.8s)]
*  I'm not delusional about it. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5712.160000000001s)]
*  But the cameras are gonna be everywhere. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5713.88s)]
*  Next time we connect, I'm gonna show a slide on this. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5715.96s)]
*  It's super funny, but we'll do that next time. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5718.240000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5720.4800000000005s)]
*  All right. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5721.320000000001s)]
*  So a couple of slides in the bio-biological world. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5722.160000000001s)]
*  Carefully making investments in it. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5727.4s)]
*  And I think this is where all of the longevity play [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5730.68s)]
*  is gonna be happening. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5734.4s)]
*  It's the impact of AI on the complexity of the human body. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5735.44s)]
*  40 trillion cells, every cell running about five to 10 [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5740.639999999999s)]
*  billion calculations per second per cell. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5745.68s)]
*  So how can you possibly understand that? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5749.96s)]
*  By the way, a quick shout out. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5752.12s)]
*  We're running our Longevity Platinum Trip [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5753.4s)]
*  at the end of September. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5755.82s)]
*  It's capped at 60 individuals. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5757.34s)]
*  We're at 54. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5759.299999999999s)]
*  There are six seats left. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5760.66s)]
*  If you're interested in joining me for full five days, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5761.82s)]
*  go check out abundance360.com slash longevity [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5765.38s)]
*  and you can get some more information there. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5770.179999999999s)]
*  But let's listen to this. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5772.0199999999995s)]
*  This is Introducing CHI 2, [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5773.139999999999s)]
*  a major breakthrough in molecular design. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5775.719999999999s)]
*  We've now developed the ability to engineer molecules [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5777.98s)]
*  and place atoms in 3D space. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5780.58s)]
*  It's like Photoshop for molecules. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5782.84s)]
*  Previous methods have had to screen millions [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5785.18s)]
*  or sometimes billions of protein sequences [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5786.9400000000005s)]
*  to find a solution. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5788.9400000000005s)]
*  But with our latest breakthrough, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5790.34s)]
*  we're often successful on the first try. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5791.900000000001s)]
*  The solutions that our models come up with [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5794.22s)]
*  are incredibly creative. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5796.3s)]
*  They think very differently than our scientists do. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5798.38s)]
*  There was a group that had been working on this [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5801.58s)]
*  hard problem for about three, four years, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5803.1s)]
*  having spent five, $10 million in the program. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5805.26s)]
*  We typed what they were working on into CHI 2. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5808.62s)]
*  Within hours, we had a candidate solution. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5811.14s)]
*  And within two weeks, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5813.14s)]
*  we had those solutions validated experimentally [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5814.26s)]
*  in the laboratory. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5816.34s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5818.740000000001s)]
*  Celine, this is- These types of breakthroughs [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5822.58s)]
*  are where we're gonna have the biggest outcomes [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5824.1s)]
*  for humanity where we find these things [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5826.820000000001s)]
*  that we couldn't find otherwise. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5829.06s)]
*  Yeah, it is spectacular. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5831.26s)]
*  By the way, if you're listening to this [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5833.26s)]
*  and you haven't listened to my podcast [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5834.42s)]
*  that I did with David Sinclair, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5838.12s)]
*  I think it was a couple of weeks ago, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5841.02s)]
*  one of my best podcasts ever. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5843.46s)]
*  And he's using this kind of technology [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5845.86s)]
*  to develop a age reversal pill. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5849.0199999999995s)]
*  And so thrilled about David's work. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5852.5s)]
*  We're gonna be spending the weekend with David [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5854.62s)]
*  at the Longevity Platinum Trip at the end of September. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5857.0599999999995s)]
*  Here is one other related article. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5861.38s)]
*  And this is fascinating. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5863.98s)]
*  So Big Pharma has this giant lock [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5865.12s)]
*  on trillions of dollars worth of value, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5868.98s)]
*  which they have biologic patents. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5872.34s)]
*  And here's a tool that is able to recreate a protein [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5875.58s)]
*  that mimics an existing biologic drug, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5880.54s)]
*  but works around the patents. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5884.02s)]
*  So generics. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5886.900000000001s)]
*  The play is not gonna slow down [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5887.74s)]
*  because they're so- [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5888.74s)]
*  What's Tony Robbins quote on this? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5890.14s)]
*  A healthy person has a thousand wishes, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5893.78s)]
*  a sick person has one. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5895.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, beautiful. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5897.820000000001s)]
*  It's all much good that's gonna happen [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5899.74s)]
*  so quickly from this. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5901.1s)]
*  And we can't afford to slow down [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5902.860000000001s)]
*  because a lot of people are saying, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5903.820000000001s)]
*  why don't we just stop? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5904.660000000001s)]
*  Which for two reasons. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5905.5s)]
*  One, because of this [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5906.660000000001s)]
*  and two, because China's gonna keep going anyway. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5907.820000000001s)]
*  But this is the really beautiful thing [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5910.42s)]
*  about what we're doing with AI now. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5912.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5914.820000000001s)]
*  We're about to wrap. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5916.22s)]
*  I'll just hit humanoid robots and we'll cut it off there. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5918.5s)]
*  Gotta hand it to the Chinese. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5922.3s)]
*  Beijing is hosting the world's first humanoid robot games. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5924.06s)]
*  I think this could get interesting in the final result. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5928.26s)]
*  I really want those giant mech robots battling out. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5932.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5937.9s)]
*  I think gymnastics will be cool. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5938.74s)]
*  I've seen the soccer on these little guys. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5940.42s)]
*  It's kind of slow, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5942.34s)]
*  but it's gonna grow exponentially. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5944.34s)]
*  It's pretty funky, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5946.18s)]
*  but it's gonna improve exponentially. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5947.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5948.22s)]
*  We're seeing robots have taken over the Amazon warehouse, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5949.46s)]
*  but what's new is one of the companies [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5953.86s)]
*  called Agility Robotics [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5958.299999999999s)]
*  is actually gonna be putting their robots [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5960.339999999999s)]
*  in Amazon Rivian vans [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5963.7s)]
*  and those robots will do the last hundred feet. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5966.86s)]
*  I think we talked about that last week. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5969.099999999999s)]
*  And this is a cool point. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5971.7s)]
*  This video doesn't have sound, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5975.82s)]
*  but the way that we solve the US debt problem [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5977.98s)]
*  is by hyper growth on the backside of AI and robotics. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5982.3s)]
*  And the notion is when robots build robots [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5987.54s)]
*  and AIs build AIs. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5990.9400000000005s)]
*  Thoughts about this? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5993.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's gonna be... [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5995.54s)]
*  I think a lot about, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5997.02s)]
*  you see these pictures of India [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=5998.06s)]
*  and Peter, you were over there not that long ago, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6000.34s)]
*  and there's piles and piles and piles of trash [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6003.38s)]
*  from massive overpopulation. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6005.900000000001s)]
*  And then you think about the robot cleaning, sorting, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6007.62s)]
*  and recycling every little bit of it [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6010.94s)]
*  and it becomes this beautiful green paradise. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6012.379999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly what will be possible [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6014.379999999999s)]
*  in just a couple of years. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6017.219999999999s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6019.139999999999s)]
*  I have one thing we need to think about [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6020.74s)]
*  and we may need to dwell more about this [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6022.54s)]
*  is that when you have increased efficiency [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6024.42s)]
*  like humanoid robots can bring us, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6027.0599999999995s)]
*  GDP will actually drop. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6029.0599999999995s)]
*  Because if I can do something for a 10th of the price, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6031.74s)]
*  that money isn't circulating in the economy. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6033.94s)]
*  So we're gonna have to think about a new different measures [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6036.7s)]
*  like some of the Human Development Index [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6039.38s)]
*  or some of the others that people have come up with [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6041.06s)]
*  to measure success. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6043.26s)]
*  I don't wanna go into that math right now, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6046.54s)]
*  but we should have that conversation, right? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6048.18s)]
*  Because the other argument that people make [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6050.34s)]
*  is we're gonna have this massive spike in GDP [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6053.54s)]
*  as labor costs and cognitive costs go to zero [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6056.78s)]
*  and the denominator starts shrinking rapidly. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6061.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, wait, one more thing. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6065.7s)]
*  It's in the tech world. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6069.74s)]
*  We all have to wear black t-shirts for this segment. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6072.18s)]
*  And why? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6074.66s)]
*  In the tech world, something happened this past week [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6076.46s)]
*  and that is Elon announces America party. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6079.78s)]
*  He puts out this poll and he says, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6085.54s)]
*  should we form a independent party [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6087.38s)]
*  to break the monopoly of the two party system? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6090.5s)]
*  Two to one, the answer is yes. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6093.54s)]
*  And then Elon announces his plans to do that. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6095.34s)]
*  Comments on this before we wrap, Dave. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6099.9400000000005s)]
*  Actually, we had a great riff with Anthony Scaramucci [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6103.02s)]
*  on this a couple of days ago. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6106.14s)]
*  So check out, is that podcast out? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6107.62s)]
*  It should be. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6109.22s)]
*  The podcast is out with Anthony, yes. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6110.06s)]
*  Yeah, check it out. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6111.820000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people loved it [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6113.26s)]
*  even though I'm not a big politics guy usually, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6114.38s)]
*  but I think everyone agrees. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6116.78s)]
*  We need much, much more rapid progress. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6118.820000000001s)]
*  The tech is gonna move forward regardless [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6122.9400000000005s)]
*  and if you don't change something, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6125.38s)]
*  we're not gonna have any regulation or any, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6127.62s)]
*  it'll get ugly if we don't do something. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6130.0199999999995s)]
*  So I think Elon recognizes that. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6132.38s)]
*  But I was really always wondering how this would play out [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6134.219999999999s)]
*  because so much of the voting process now [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6136.42s)]
*  has moved to meta, Facebook and Instagram, [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6139.42s)]
*  Snapchat, Twitter, now X, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6143.9s)]
*  and it's owned by the big tech guys. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6146.66s)]
*  But that's actually the election determiner too. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6150.7s)]
*  So something had to collide. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6152.98s)]
*  This is a very direct collision right here. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6155.5s)]
*  It doesn't get more. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6157.7s)]
*  What I was surprised at, given the audience that is on X, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6158.54s)]
*  I thought the number would be much higher than 65%. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6161.58s)]
*  I would have put it more like 80% would say yes. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6164.34s)]
*  It definitely badly needs to happen [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6167.14s)]
*  because the current system is totally broken. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6168.74s)]
*  The spending and the pork in this bill is off the hook [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6171.0599999999995s)]
*  in terms of creating more and more debt. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6173.78s)]
*  There's a really big existential threat here [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6176.34s)]
*  because they've shown that if you go over 130% debt to GDP, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6178.46s)]
*  your civilization collapses very quickly afterwards. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6185.099999999999s)]
*  And we're at 126 or 127%. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6188.38s)]
*  So this puts it over the top. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6191.94s)]
*  Flashing red lights, flashing red lights. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6193.94s)]
*  Red lights at lots of levels [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6196.3s)]
*  and we can talk more about this another time. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6197.74s)]
*  Oh my God, the one thing that's interesting [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6200.0599999999995s)]
*  is it would definitely be a tech-forward party. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6202.26s)]
*  I think the best way to drive debt reduction [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6208.74s)]
*  and growth in US GDP, yes, it's robotics, yes, it's AI, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6213.5s)]
*  but it's also extending the healthy human lifespan [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6217.9400000000005s)]
*  and health span, right? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6221.66s)]
*  If you gave everyone in the US an extra 20 healthy years [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6222.66s)]
*  where they're not making payments to their doctors, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6227.1s)]
*  they're not in pain, they're not missing work, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6229.38s)]
*  where 80 years old is the new 40, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6231.58s)]
*  that would change the game in a significant fashion. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6235.26s)]
*  So that's my vote. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6238.62s)]
*  Here's the structural outcome of this. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6240.26s)]
*  If this becomes real, which I hope it really does, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6241.82s)]
*  then what happens is this becomes the marginal decider [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6244.54s)]
*  for any election. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6247.7s)]
*  Whoever collaborates with this party [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6248.82s)]
*  will decide the future and therefore [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6252.38s)]
*  you get to dictate policy, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6254.259999999999s)]
*  which I think is the real outcome, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6255.54s)]
*  which I think would be hugely beneficial. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6256.78s)]
*  Yeah, but we don't talk about politics on this podcast. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6259.38s)]
*  It was so fun to see some of our fans [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6263.219999999999s)]
*  in the notes to this podcast saying, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6265.62s)]
*  I love you so much more than the All In podcast [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6268.219999999999s)]
*  as you talk about real science and technology [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6270.38s)]
*  versus politics. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6272.34s)]
*  So just thank you for that comment. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6274.1s)]
*  And we love doing this. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6277.14s)]

*  just so we can see that number tick along. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6284.54s)]
*  It incentivizes us. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6287.7s)]
*  Dave, take care, buddy. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6289.5s)]
*  Saleem, I'll talk to you soon. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6291.5s)]
*  All right. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6293.82s)]
*  I think our next podcast guest on WTF [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6294.66s)]
*  is gonna be Emad Mustak, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6296.9800000000005s)]
*  back by popular demand. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6298.54s)]
*  That'll be fun. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6300.3s)]
*  One quick thing on the 23rd, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6301.26s)]
*  we're doing a workshop for a couple of hours. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6302.82s)]
*  Yeah, tell me about EXO. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6304.78s)]
*  Yeah, if people are interested, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6306.1s)]
*  on the 23rd we're doing a two hour workshop [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6307.1s)]
*  where we go deep into one of the attributes. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6309.62s)]
*  We do this every month. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6311.66s)]
*  It sells out, it's 100 bucks. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6312.82s)]
*  And so come along and help take your company [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6314.66s)]
*  to the next level by applying this. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6317.78s)]
*  Okay, so just to slow this down one second, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6319.66s)]
*  it's an EXO workshop, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6321.82s)]
*  an exponential organizations workshop. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6323.46s)]
*  It's a two hour workshop where we invite people to come. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6325.3s)]
*  It's limited to a certain number. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6327.02s)]
*  It's 100 bucks. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6329.660000000001s)]
*  And we spend two hours going into [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6330.780000000001s)]
*  the key attribute of the EXO model [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6332.540000000001s)]
*  like crowd community AMI. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6335.02s)]
*  Where do they find out about it? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6336.42s)]
*  We'll put the link in the description [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6338.42s)]

*  It's selling out totally. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6346.5s)]
*  It's gonna be a lot of fun. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6348.1s)]
*  Love it, love it. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6349.38s)]
*  All right, moonshot mates. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6350.740000000001s)]
*  Love you both. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6352.02s)]

*  Be well. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6354.22s)]
*  See you next time. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6355.06s)]

*  Yeah, I'll see you in a Scaramoochie. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6357.7s)]
*  If you could have had a 10 year head start [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6359.82s)]
*  on the dot com boom back in the 2000s, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0MUe-0zpBQ&t=6361.82s)]
