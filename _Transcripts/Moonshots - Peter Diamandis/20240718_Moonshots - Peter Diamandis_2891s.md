# How Building Muscle Can Add Years to Your Life & Ozempic's Impact w/ Krystal Zell | EP #110
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ)
*  What do you think the number one reason that people don't work out is? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=5.2s)]
*  People who are going on a weight loss journey think about cardio because that's kind of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=10.38s)]
*  the dominant narrative in America is get on a bike, you know, go to a cardio class and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=13.76s)]
*  now tell you to lose weight, go for a run. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Sleep, diet, exercise, mindset, the right, you know, supplements and meds. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=21.44s)]
*  If you have to do one thing, it's muscle mass, it's strength. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=25.28s)]
*  The bottom third of the population from a muscular perspective has a 50% increased mortality rate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=29.6s)]
*  The number one thing to do in terms of reducing all-cause mortality is building muscle. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=36.4s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=44.28s)]
*  Today, we're going to talk about one of the most important aspects of longevity and that's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=45.28s)]
*  building muscle mass. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=49.96s)]
*  It's building strength. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  If you could have a single thing to do that extends your health span, not just your lifespan, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=52.92s)]
*  it is building muscle. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=58.32s)]
*  My guest today is Crystal Zell. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=60.12s)]
*  She's the CEO of Tonal, an AI powered at home training system. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=61.8s)]
*  She previously was at Bain, at Starwood Hotels, at Simon Property Group and recently the Home [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=67.86s)]
*  Depot and she's running a company that is making your ability to get in great shape, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=73.68s)]
*  to build muscle and strength really easy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  If you believe that time is your problem or knowledge is your problem or money is your [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=84.48s)]
*  problem, listen up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=88.48s)]
*  This is an important episode. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  Her Moonshot is really to make this accessible to everybody. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  All right, let's jump in and if you enjoy this podcast, please like this, please share [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=95.0s)]
*  it with your friends, share it with your aging mom and dad because, you know, the number [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=101.64s)]
*  one thing you could do if you're over the age of 60 is work out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=107.56s)]
*  It reduces all cause mortality by 50%, reduces cancer, reduces falls. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=112.0s)]
*  It is your number one longevity supplement and therapeutic. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=117.64s)]
*  All right, let's jump into the episode. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=121.76s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=124.52s)]
*  I'm here with Crystal Zell, the CEO of Tonal, a company I have admired and in full disclosure, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=125.92s)]
*  I've got my Tonal ordered for installation shortly. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=133.2s)]
*  Crystal, good to see you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=136.72s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=138.68s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=139.68s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=140.68s)]
*  Yeah, and I see the Tonal in the background over your left shoulder, if I've got the directions [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=142.16s)]
*  correct. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  So, I want to start with an assumption. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  What do you think the number one reason that people don't work out is? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=153.52s)]
*  Well, that's a great question. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=158.16s)]
*  I think it's a combination of things. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=161.4s)]
*  I mean, I think part of it is the habit formation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  I think what we know is people who work out consistently, they form a habit and then it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=169.36s)]
*  just becomes built into their lives. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=174.0s)]
*  And when you talk to them, they can't imagine not working out. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=176.68s)]
*  But formation of a habit is so hard. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=181.4s)]
*  You have to have the intent to have the habit, then you have to have the time, and then you [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=183.36s)]
*  have to have the solution and the plan of what you're going to do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=188.52s)]
*  And I think for a lot of people, they could have a time problem. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  We can always create time, but sometimes there are periods of life where time is really challenging. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  And then for others, it's the what do I do? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=202.92s)]
*  So an example is I was talking with a fellow mom the other day of a friend of my son's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=206.04s)]
*  mom who we were talking about the importance of strength training as you get older. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=214.28s)]
*  And she says, you know, I know I am supposed to do it, but I don't even know how to start. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=219.16s)]
*  I don't know what I'm supposed to do, which was a great way of having the conversation [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=224.76s)]
*  to begin the process of what should you do? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  So I think I think it's a lot of things, but I definitely think time and know how are are [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  two critical ones. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=237.72s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=239.72s)]
*  There are three in my mind. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  I think the number one reason people don't work out is they say, I don't have time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm busy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm up and running at the moment I get up and God, I can't get to the gym and do this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  I think the second reason a lot of people don't work out is they don't realize how critical [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=253.04s)]
*  it is in their lives. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=256.96s)]
*  And I think I've heard you say this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=259.56s)]
*  I've said this on stage. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=261.32s)]
*  If you had to do only one thing, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=262.84s)]
*  So it's sleep, diet, exercise mindset, the right supplements and meds. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=265.12s)]
*  If you had to do one thing, it's muscle mass, it's strength, it is especially if you're [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=269.84s)]
*  over 60. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=275.44s)]
*  So I'm 63 next month. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=276.44s)]
*  It is the number one thing I'm focused on doing over everything else. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=278.6s)]
*  So number one, people think I don't have time. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=283.64s)]
*  Number two, they don't know how important it is in their life. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=286.04s)]
*  And the number three is probably, like you said, knowing how or what's the right way [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=290.68s)]
*  to work out or how should what should I be doing in a workout. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=297.24s)]
*  And if you're listening and that's you, if you're just like, you know, I'm going to sleep [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=301.72s)]
*  when I'm dead, I'm going to work out when I'm dead, you know, if that's your mindset [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=306.84s)]
*  or, you know, you don't you just haven't clicked in with how important it is. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=310.44s)]
*  Because for me, you know, Crystal, I this was not always me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  I was in reasonably good shape, but I never had a focus on on physical strength training, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=320.52s)]
*  on weightlifting, on those practices, because I didn't realize how important it is until [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=327.32s)]
*  I really went on this longevity journey and longevity moonshot for myself over the last [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=332.84s)]
*  10 years. I was like, oh, my God, I have a lot of catching up to do. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  And the numbers we'll talk about the science there in a little bit are are extraordinary. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=343.56s)]
*  And then what to do, right? You can you can hire a coach, a workout coach, which I do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  I belong to three gyms and I have two workout coaches. I have zero excuses other than, oh, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=354.44s)]
*  shit, I woke up too late. I've got 20 minutes or 30 minutes and I'm going to do some push ups. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=361.16s)]
*  I'm going to do some pull ups and stuff like that in in the bedroom. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  But total solves a lot of that, doesn't it? That's right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=371.0s)]
*  Yeah. And let's let's dive into. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=375.24s)]
*  I want to I want to dive first into the science. I want people I want you to to understand if you [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=379.16s)]
*  have not committed to your workout. Right. And we've had lots of different podcasts on sleep, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=385.4s)]
*  on diet, on meds and supplements and so forth. But let's get people hot and bothered about the need [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=392.52s)]
*  to work out. So, Cher, what's your number one convincing data here? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think the first one I would share is that as we age, starting at 45 or so, we lose one to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  two percent of our muscle mass a year. I mean, we really start to lose muscle. And then if you [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=413.0s)]
*  start with that starting point, what you see in the data is that those individuals with stronger [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=419.64s)]
*  starting points from a strength perspective, they do well. They do better from a mortality perspective. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=426.6s)]
*  So I think for me, there's a very staggering statistic, which is that the bottom third of the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=431.8s)]
*  population from a muscular perspective, when you sort of test muscle strength, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=437.96s)]
*  has a 50 percent increased mortality rate. So when you think about longevity, it's incredible. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=445.56s)]
*  And then the other the other thing, there's a ton of science around how strength as you age [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=451.64s)]
*  prevents falls. And falls are incredibly detrimental as all of us know, who've had parents or [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  grandparents go through these experiences. There's nothing like a fall to really ruin [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  your quality of life as well as potentially your lifespan. And I think even just getting injured, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=470.44s)]
*  we know this, like as we go through our lives, one little knee injury, one little elbow injury, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=475.88s)]
*  it can be minor, can have a massive impact on your life. And so the best way of preventing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  any of those things from happening is to have strength and have a strong focus on balance [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=486.44s)]
*  as you go through your life. So there's just the statistics are so clear. The data and the science [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=492.35999999999996s)]
*  is so clear about how absolutely crucial strength is for aging. Yeah, let me echo that. There is a [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=499.0s)]
*  direct correlation between the amount of muscle mass you carry on your body and your longevity. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=505.64s)]
*  And that comes from a multiple areas. Like you said, if you fall and break a hip or pelvis [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  over the age of I think 65, your one year survival rate is relatively low, which is crazy [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=518.76s)]
*  because you end up in the hospital with a pneumonia and that's how my dad passed, right? He was in his [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=527.24s)]
*  80s, but it was a fall, broke his pelvis and ended up in the hospital and it was a downward spiral. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=532.12s)]
*  I know so many folks who've done that and muscle mass and strength allows you to catch yourself [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=537.8s)]
*  and prevent that. And also by the way, the stress that weightlifting strength [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=543.32s)]
*  building puts on your bones helps maintain your stronger bones. The other thing is, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=550.6s)]
*  and the data is very clear, that if you're over the age of 60, the number one thing to do [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=557.24s)]
*  in terms of reducing all cause mortality is building muscle. And it doesn't take that much [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=564.84s)]
*  each week, right? It's like it's an hour twice a week or half an hour twice a week. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=570.68s)]
*  Let's talk about the simplicity of Tonal and I want to get into how does this work? How is [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=577.56s)]
*  it installed? How do you use it? I want to paint a picture for folks around this, but what I love [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=582.3599999999999s)]
*  is the ability to get rid of excuses when you only have a small amount of time. Yeah, that's right. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=589.7199999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. And then the only thing I wanted to add one last comment to you before [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=596.92s)]
*  transitioning to how Tonal solves that is as a female in this space, which is very, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=601.0s)]
*  mostly men, I think really very much focused strongly in the fitness and the strength space. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=608.36s)]
*  I want to use that as a platform, the fact that I am a female for the women out there, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=614.52s)]
*  because for men, I think it's even a bit more part of our culture around driving to do [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=619.24s)]
*  strength training or for women it isn't. And it's almost more important for women because [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=625.4s)]
*  as we go through, like from a menopause perspective and the shifting in your body, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=629.8s)]
*  that you have to do the strength work because you're not naturally getting it any other way and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=634.28s)]
*  you're losing muscle even more so. So I say this because I just think it's important that I use [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=638.84s)]
*  this platform to help also educate women about the importance of strength training because we do see [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=644.28s)]
*  it's a harder adoption cycle for women to decide to do it. So and that's why Tonal is great because [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=650.44s)]
*  from a practicality perspective, there's a bunch of benefits about it. So I'll just kind of describe [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=657.8800000000001s)]
*  the product. The product itself is a digital weight system. So it essentially replicates a gym [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=662.2s)]
*  of weights and free weights and it puts it in a very small space, seven by seven, because it goes [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=670.84s)]
*  on your wall. And on your wall, you basically see if you can see behind me, the device, you know, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=675.24s)]
*  you see a screen behind the screen is basically sort of some motors and cables and computers. And [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=679.8000000000001s)]
*  what the device does is it allows you to have a very personalized and tailored weight training [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=688.2s)]
*  experience. So it will respond to your body will understand what you're able to do, it will set [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=694.52s)]
*  weight appropriate for you. Then on top of that, you pair great content. So you'll choose a program, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  a class, and you'll have an instructor come on the device and walk you through everything [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=706.44s)]
*  you're supposed to do. And then the weight will automatically adjust for you. And so it's just [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=711.4000000000001s)]
*  completely personalized and tailored to you in your home is definitely home device, you won't [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=716.44s)]
*  find it in a gym. This is a home device. And the intent of it is to be super convenient. So you can [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=721.8800000000001s)]
*  go from rolling out of bed to getting your strength routine and very quickly, you don't have to worry [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=728.2800000000001s)]
*  about going to a gym, you don't have to sort of take back to the kind of concept of time is my [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=733.0s)]
*  problem, takes away the time issue, you can do honestly, 10 minutes goes a long way. You can do [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=737.64s)]
*  a lot in 10 minutes, you could do a full lower body set of squats and lunges in five minutes or [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=743.96s)]
*  in 10 minutes, and it has a huge impact. So you can do that 10 minutes at the beginning of the day, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=749.32s)]
*  10 minutes at the end of the day, which is not a whole lot out of your life, and you can get your [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=753.16s)]
*  strength training in. So it's incredibly convenient, super personalized to, you know, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=758.6s)]
*  and also to your whole household. So you can have my husband has an account, he does a totally [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=764.6800000000001s)]
*  different set of things than what I do, and how I focus. And so it serves the entire household, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=769.0s)]
*  super convenient, super personalized. And that's really the power of digital weight. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=774.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I love that. How long does it take to install and how is it installed? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=778.84s)]
*  You order a tonal and what happens? And so we do, the first thing you have to do is a little bit of [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=784.1999999999999s)]
*  a survey so we know what kind of wall we're going to install. And we can pretty much install on any [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=791.3199999999999s)]
*  wall. There's a few exceptions, but pretty much any wall. So we have to understand like your home [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=795.0s)]
*  and make sure you have the right space for pretty much everything. It's pretty straightforward and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=800.3599999999999s)]
*  easy on that regard. Then within two weeks, you're going to have an appointment to have your tonal [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=805.4s)]
*  installed. And you'll have professionals show up, they'll fully install it so the customers [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=809.16s)]
*  have to do any installation. It goes on the wall and it's a large device, but it's really not that [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=814.52s)]
*  different than a TV mount. So there's sort of a bracket that goes on behind it, the device gets [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=821.24s)]
*  installed. You hook it up to the Wi-Fi and then from there you set up your account and then you [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=826.68s)]
*  can start it. And that's really all there is to it. Everybody want to take a short break from our [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=831.8s)]
*  episode to talk about a company that's very important to me and could actually save your [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=835.88s)]
*  life or the life of someone that you love. The company is called Fountain Life and it's a company [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=841.16s)]
*  I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented physicians. You know, most of us [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=845.88s)]
*  don't actually know what's going on inside our body. We're all optimists. Until that day when you [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=852.04s)]
*  have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency room and they say, listen, I'm [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=858.36s)]
*  sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or four going on. And you know, it didn't [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=862.44s)]
*  start that morning. It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time, but because we never [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=868.2800000000001s)]
*  look, we don't find out. So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=874.2800000000001s)]
*  diagnostic centers. We have four across the U.S. today and we're building 20 around the world. These [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=881.0s)]
*  centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary CT looking for [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=887.08s)]
*  soft plaque, dexa scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive blood workup. It's the most [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=894.12s)]
*  advanced workup you'll ever receive. 150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=901.0s)]
*  to find any disease at the very beginning when it's solvable. You're going to find out eventually. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=908.9200000000001s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. Fountain Life also has an entire side of [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=915.4799999999999s)]
*  therapeutics. We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=920.12s)]
*  healthy years to your life and we provide them to you at our centers. So if this is of interest to [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=924.28s)]
*  you, please go and check it out. Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. When Tony and I wrote our New York [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=931.16s)]
*  Times bestseller Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out to us for Fountain Life memberships. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=940.12s)]
*  You go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. We'll put you to the top of the list. Really it's [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=947.08s)]
*  something that is for me one of the most important things I offer my entire family, the CEOs of my [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=952.84s)]
*  companies, my friends. It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. Go to [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=959.32s)]
*  fountainlife.com backslash Peter. It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=966.84s)]
*  of my listeners. All right, let's go back to our episode. One of the things that has been a recent [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=972.2s)]
*  increase for you is incorporating AI into the system and really becoming a data-driven [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=980.12s)]
*  workout system. I think about the notion that when I join a gym and I'm a member of, like I said, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=986.84s)]
*  three gyms and two coaches and the coach is the part that is the expert that helps me and motivates [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=997.48s)]
*  me. But you do that with video and with AI in the system. Can you speak to that and how much data [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1005.8s)]
*  have you collected over people and how are you using that data? Because data is the oil of AI [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1012.36s)]
*  systems. Yeah, and we have incredible amount of oil so to speak. I'll start with the data collection. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1017.32s)]
*  From a privacy perspective, I want to reassure the audience. We don't do anything with the data [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1027.64s)]
*  other than make the experience better for you. There's no selling, sharing, anything like that [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1031.88s)]
*  around the data. The data is just to create better workouts and to provide personalization. We [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1036.92s)]
*  collect data on everything that the user does. The weights that were set, if they were adjusted, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1041.64s)]
*  how many reps you did, how many sets you did. Then as you get stronger and we add weight, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1050.1200000000001s)]
*  we see all of it. We also note any time that's taken as rest time. Every piece of data about [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1057.3200000000002s)]
*  the experience around the individual is tracked. We have over 150,000 members who've completed [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1065.8799999999999s)]
*  millions and millions of workouts. We've tracked billions and billions of pounds lifted. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1072.04s)]
*  We're able to take all of that data. Then the benefit too is we longitudinally see what happens [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1077.32s)]
*  to everybody. One great stat is a new member in their first year, their strength score. The strength [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1083.8799999999999s)]
*  score is this calculation. It's a bit of an algorithm that assesses your strength. The great [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1091.32s)]
*  thing about it is you can watch it grow and you can watch it improve as you get stronger and [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1096.4399999999998s)]
*  stronger. Our average member, their strength score goes up 80% in the first year of using Tonal. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1100.28s)]
*  It's just incredible. They grow. Actually, a lot of the growth happens in the first several months, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1107.24s)]
*  which is fantastic to see. We also see that they're using, there's a lot of usage. We track all of our [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1112.12s)]
*  usage data. We see the cohorts and the patterns. We see the spikes in January. We see a little bit [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1118.12s)]
*  of the dips in March. We see people start to get ready for summer bikini weather. We see all of it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1125.8s)]
*  The great news is we have this amazing foundation of data. Then we're leveraging the data in two [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1134.4399999999998s)]
*  ways. The first way, I talked about that already, was the original use of AI in the device was to [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1138.76s)]
*  create the weight pattern needed for the member at their point in time. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1145.24s)]
*  We're setting the weights that they need. Then what we're working on now, which is really exciting, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1150.04s)]
*  and it's in beta mode. We have a certain number of subscribers who have access to it. We'll be [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1155.72s)]
*  rolling this out as we go along this year. It's truly getting to taking the language models [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1161.64s)]
*  that everybody's so excited about right now, working them with our data so that the member [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1168.68s)]
*  can get direct advice. It's easy to process. It also gives the member a way to tell us what's [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1174.04s)]
*  going on with their lives. You could say something like, for me, for example, right now, I've had it [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1181.08s)]
*  as a goal for myself that I never learned to play tennis when I was a kid. I have two kids that love [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1187.3999999999999s)]
*  tennis. I have a husband who loves tennis. I was like, I need to learn to play tennis. I have to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1193.48s)]
*  just, I have to do this. I have to get decent enough at tennis that when the kids are grown, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1197.6399999999999s)]
*  we can all go out on the tennis court and have a fun little family tennis match. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1202.44s)]
*  You could say to Tony, which is what we're calling our AI, you could say, Tony, I'm training for [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1208.3600000000001s)]
*  tennis. I'd like the best set of programs for me to get better at tennis. Then literally, the AI [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1215.4s)]
*  will feedback to the customer based upon all the data that we have. There'll be a logic process [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1223.3200000000002s)]
*  to it. It's like understanding, okay, if you're going to be good at tennis, you need to be good [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1229.0s)]
*  at serving. Shoulder work would probably be really useful because I've learned a lot of serving is [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1232.52s)]
*  in the shoulders and the legs. We would say, okay, here's the exercises that you should do [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1236.76s)]
*  for this purpose. It's super cool. We're really, really, really excited about it because it enables [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1243.24s)]
*  us to understand. Yeah, Tony, it's a full language AI. Conversational. We've never before, getting, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1249.48s)]
*  I've been doing consumer work my whole career and the holy grail is understanding the customer. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1257.96s)]
*  Every good consumer executive wants to understand what their customer needs [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1263.32s)]
*  and deliver it to them. It's always been so hard to understand what a customer really wants and [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1268.52s)]
*  what do they need. This is so exciting because we can have a conversation and we can say, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1272.6000000000001s)]
*  what do you want to accomplish? What's important to you? Then we can go back into our data sets [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1277.64s)]
*  and we can help give that member guidance and advice. Of course, it's going to get better and [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1283.72s)]
*  better over time. We're truly getting to incredibly personalized recommendations. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1289.32s)]
*  Again, there's a lot of entrepreneurs listening here who are working on their [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1296.1999999999998s)]
*  massive transformative purpose, their moonshots, they're starting their companies. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1301.1599999999999s)]
*  Tony, I am curious about the origin story for Tonal. You've been the CEO now for how long? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1306.1200000000001s)]
*  Last year or two? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. What is the origin story? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1314.44s)]
*  Give us a little bit of background on how this device, what it looked like in the beginning [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1320.68s)]
*  and how far has it come in terms of iterating your product market fit? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1327.16s)]
*  Ali Aradi is our founder. I'll do my best to channel him. He does such a better job than I [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1331.48s)]
*  do talking about his story because this is really his story. Ali's story is that he's an engineer, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1340.28s)]
*  incredibly talented, both hardware and software engineer with a lot of phenomenal experience. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1348.04s)]
*  Earlier in his career, he worked and worked and worked and worked and worked and worked and [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1356.76s)]
*  worked and worked and worked and his health fell by the wayside. He got to be overweight. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1361.16s)]
*  He went in for a physical, the lab results were not good. He started to think, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1368.92s)]
*  I have got to do something about this. I've got to get healthier. He quit his job [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1372.8400000000001s)]
*  and decided to go on a health journey. He did a ton of research and he realized how important [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1378.28s)]
*  strength is. Not only we've been talking about strength from a long-term and a longevity [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1384.76s)]
*  perspective and I think a lot of the research he was doing at the time also painted the picture [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1388.76s)]
*  that strength is incredibly important for weight loss. People who are going on a weight loss [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1394.2s)]
*  journey think about cardio because that's the dominant narrative in America is get on a bike, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1399.56s)]
*  go to a cardio class and that's how you lose weight, go for a run. Certainly, there's so [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1407.48s)]
*  many benefits to cardio, not to disparage that at all, but there's incredible benefits [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1412.2s)]
*  to strength training as it relates to weight loss. Obviously, the more muscle mass you have, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1418.2s)]
*  the more calories you're going to burn, etc., etc. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1423.88s)]
*  Amazing. Very, very true. It's literally when you see weight lifters who have built a significant [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1427.32s)]
*  muscle mass, they're pulling in multiple thousands of calories, five, six, seven [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1435.88s)]
*  thousand calories because they're burning so much in their muscles. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1441.72s)]
*  That's right. He said, okay, I'm going to focus on strength. He was in the gym every day. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1446.5200000000002s)]
*  He looked around and he's like, I'm an engineer. Everything in my world is digital now. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1454.3600000000001s)]
*  Everything I do is digital. We've digitized everything and everything has an intelligence [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1459.8000000000002s)]
*  kind of layer built behind it. Here he is in a gym and he's like, okay, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1464.44s)]
*  so my options are to hire a personal trainer, kind of do what they say, kind of do some research [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1469.24s)]
*  online. But then there's all these gaps in the experience. The muscles I train, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1475.16s)]
*  I have no record of, the reps I do, I can't see cause and effect because it's only going to be [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1481.0s)]
*  as good as how my bookkeeping is. Do I go then take all the reps and I put it in Excel and then I try [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1486.68s)]
*  to see, you know, did I see growth? I mean, like, and it's so funny because it reminds me of when [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1492.2s)]
*  I was, I remember being in my twenties, I was before I got married and had kids was in the gym [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1498.3600000000001s)]
*  all the time every day. And I remember keeping an Excel spreadsheet of all the, all the, all the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1504.1200000000001s)]
*  things I did in the gym, every weight or every move, the number of the amount of weight, the reps, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1509.88s)]
*  the whole thing. Cause I was trying to see correlations in outcomes with the work that [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1515.8s)]
*  I was doing. And so here we were even many years after that experience and he's like, there's no, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1521.96s)]
*  why is there no better way? Right? Like why is, why is there no, no better way? And he said, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1530.12s)]
*  I'm going to create a better way. And so he got to work on this notion of digital weight, which is [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1536.52s)]
*  I'm going to create the sensation of weight. I'm going to create this experience of weight. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1542.92s)]
*  And then because it's done digitally, every element of these periods will be tracked. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1547.96s)]
*  We'll have better understanding knowledge of how cause drives effect truly when it comes to weight [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1553.96s)]
*  training, and then can build a platform for personalizing anybody's weight loss experience, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1560.8400000000001s)]
*  their muscle building experience, their aging experience, all of these different [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1567.96s)]
*  experiences, which can be completely changed really by having this platform. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1572.6s)]
*  As humans, especially if you're an entrepreneur, there's a competitive element in your life. You [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1579.0s)]
*  set objectives and you try and hit them and being able to measure your progress is really [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1585.24s)]
*  important. I mean, so I have a in-body scale that I use that measures my lean body mass and my muscle [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1593.6399999999999s)]
*  and my total weight. And I'm like, that's, you know, last year I set a goal of adding 10 pounds [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1601.8s)]
*  of muscle, which is, wasn't easy. But I remember the reason how I met Tonal was I was speaking [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1608.28s)]
*  at an event and I mentioned this and your chairman was in the room and he said, you should do it with [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1615.72s)]
*  Tonal. And I said, okay. I did it by, you know, increasing my protein intake to a gram per pound, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1621.3999999999999s)]
*  adding creatine and going from a couple of workouts a week to literally obsessing on trying to get five [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1630.12s)]
*  workouts per week. And really in that regard, it consumed a lot of time. And now the challenge for [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1638.12s)]
*  me is maintaining muscle mass, right? Because as you said, I mean, the term is sarcopenia [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1646.52s)]
*  and it's the loss of muscle and the ability and the difficulty of adding muscle as you grow older. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1653.96s)]
*  And there are lots of different approaches to it, but the one approach is actually doing the work. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1660.84s)]
*  And so I'm excited about getting my Tonal installed for the specific reason of getting to from, you [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1666.28s)]
*  know, from four days a week to five or six days a week so that I can always squeeze in those [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1675.24s)]
*  probably 10 minute sessions, but probably 20 minute sessions. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1683.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. I mean, that's we see so an average member session is 35 [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1685.72s)]
*  minutes and that's because we have members doing a full session, 45 minutes to an hour or a lot. And [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1692.12s)]
*  we have every variety as you can imagine from a time perspective. And then you see, you know, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1699.24s)]
*  people squeezing in 20 minute sessions in between. And, you know, we're still a lot of us are still [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1704.6s)]
*  in these remote worlds where we're, you know, maybe a couple days a week at home and you can [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1709.88s)]
*  squeeze it in in between a couple of meetings and get it done, which is really an incredible [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1713.88s)]
*  an incredible value. Yeah. Yeah. I remember reading a science fiction story years ago where [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1720.3600000000001s)]
*  it was, I forget the name of it. It was basically individuals that were put into these mech suits [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1726.2800000000002s)]
*  like a, you know, an Ironman suit and the mech suit could be programmed to become your workout [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1732.2s)]
*  buddy. So every time you moved, it was, it was adding resistance in every direction that we're [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1741.0s)]
*  going. And I was like, that sounds pretty, pretty cool. You know, if you want to be, you know, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1747.24s)]
*  squeezing micro workouts throughout the day. And I do think this is probably the closest thing to it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1752.2s)]
*  I think there's going to be eventually an extension of tonal that will be your AI that's [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1758.6s)]
*  traveling with you that incentivizes you to take the stairs instead of the elevator, or tells you [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1765.32s)]
*  to break out onto a jog for the next 30 seconds to get your heart rate up or whatever it might be. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1770.76s)]
*  And it's incorporating, you know, it's, we need incentivization. Some people are incentivized by, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1775.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, intrinsic, some other by extrinsic, and some just like someone there to kick their butt. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1782.52s)]
*  So, yeah, that's right. We have, you know, badges and all the kinds of things that people that help [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1787.64s)]
*  people as they go on that journey, because sometimes you just want that like, immediate reward, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1795.24s)]
*  that feedback. So that's right. Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? If you did, did you know that [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1800.2s)]
*  besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Labs, that they spent billions on [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1808.68s)]
*  biodefense weapons, the ability to accurately detect viruses and microbes by reading their [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1815.32s)]
*  RNA? Well, a company called Viome exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos Labs [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1821.0s)]
*  to build a platform that can measure your microbiome and the RNA in your blood. Now, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1826.9199999999998s)]
*  Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called Full Body Intelligence, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1832.6799999999998s)]
*  which collects a few drops of your blood, spit, and stool, and can tell you so much about your [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1837.1599999999999s)]
*  health. They've tested over 700,000 individuals and used their AI models to deliver members' [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1841.72s)]
*  critical health guidance, like what foods you should eat, what foods you shouldn't eat, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1847.32s)]
*  as well as your supplements and probiotics, your biological age, and other deep health insights. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1851.72s)]
*  And the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar. You know, as reported in the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1858.04s)]
*  American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, after just six months of following Viome's recommendations, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1862.6000000000001s)]
*  members reported the following. A 36% reduction in depression, a 40% reduction in anxiety, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1868.2s)]
*  a 30% reduction in diabetes, and a 48% reduction in IBS. Listen, I've been using Viome for three [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1875.16s)]
*  years. I know that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities. Best of all, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1882.1200000000001s)]
*  Viome is affordable, which is part of my mission to democratize health. If you want to join me on [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1888.52s)]
*  this journey, go to Viome.com slash Peter. I've asked Naveen Jain, a friend of mine who's the [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1894.04s)]
*  founder and CEO of Viome, to give my listeners a special discount. You'll find it at Viome.com [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1899.1599999999999s)]
*  slash Peter. Let's talk about the cost of the system. Is it an initial purchase and subscription? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1905.24s)]
*  Talk about that if you would. Yeah, that's right. So it is an initial purchase and a subscription. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1914.36s)]
*  I would think about it as the initial purchase is all the hardware. That's $39.95 plus some [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1919.56s)]
*  accessories, which includes a bench and some different handles. Then the subscription, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1925.32s)]
*  which is $59.95 a month, really gets the content, the trainers, the AI, that whole experience. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1930.76s)]
*  We think of it as you're buying the equipment like you would home gym equipment, and then you're [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1940.52s)]
*  paying for all that great training. We really try to think of the training as being in replacement [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1945.56s)]
*  of personal training. Obviously, it's not a person in your home yelling at you to go further, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1951.8799999999999s)]
*  go one more rep. It's not that experience. But we have great coaches, and they're super personable. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1957.6399999999999s)]
*  The way the device is, it's different than certain other kind of connected fitness where [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1966.12s)]
*  because it's strength training, the way you do the class is you do move at your own pace, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1971.0s)]
*  and you can do that with the class, if that makes sense. It has a lot of flexibility to it. But yeah, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1976.12s)]
*  so that's the cost. Now, we do offer a firm financing. You can get it to a monthly rate [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1982.28s)]
*  that's significantly less than a normal gym membership and a monthly rate that is much less [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1990.04s)]
*  than a single personal training session. We look at it from a value perspective to the member. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=1995.88s)]
*  You can get it to a price that's well within the realm of what a typical gym or training would be. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2003.88s)]
*  People forget, a good personal trainer is going to run you three digits per session. It's going [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2010.2s)]
*  to be $100 or more, and that's on top of your gym membership. I like to say everybody on the planet [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2019.48s)]
*  has got one thing in common. We all have 24 hours in a day, seven days a week, 365 in a year, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2030.04s)]
*  and it's how you use your time that makes you the most efficient. It's always time optimization. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2036.28s)]
*  Do you want to trade the drive time to the gym? You want to trade the convenience here. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2046.8400000000001s)]
*  For me, that's why it's a great and exciting solution. The other thing I really like about it [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2055.08s)]
*  compared to some other options I've seen is you can literally go from writing an email to hopping [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2062.04s)]
*  on it and being working out in what, a minute, two minutes, turn it on, push a button. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2071.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's really easy. Very little setup. Yeah, very, very little stuff. You move the arms down [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2078.3599999999997s)]
*  and that's pretty much it. Turn it on. Let's talk about where this industry goes next. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2084.04s)]
*  You've got an incredible background at Bain and Starwood, at Home Depot. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2093.2400000000002s)]
*  What is your vision? Where do you think this industry, what's the moonshot here for [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2105.32s)]
*  five or ten years from now? Yeah, I think big picture. There's one thing I love about this [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2111.8s)]
*  industry, which is that it is very friendly and collaborative. We're all together building a [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2118.36s)]
*  completely new industry and a new industry segment, I think, specifically in connective [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2129.2400000000002s)]
*  fitness, but I would say also fitness in general. What's incredible is despite being big, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2134.52s)]
*  we're still so much smaller, obviously, than pharmaceuticals, than all the things that deal [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2143.56s)]
*  with the problems that being out of shape creates. There's this really incredible [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2150.2000000000003s)]
*  feeling among leaders in this industry that we are trying to make the world better [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2158.1200000000003s)]
*  by helping make people healthier. There's a true mission in it. Each of us has our own approach, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2165.0s)]
*  to how we do that. The consumer needs to figure out what works best for them, but there's different [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2173.2400000000002s)]
*  approaches in nutrition, wellness, fitness. What I love about this industry is that there's just [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2180.04s)]
*  like, we are here to make the world better by making people healthier. What a great mission. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2189.0s)]
*  What I love about that is it's sort of separately. It helps us recruit great employees. We have [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2195.32s)]
*  wonderful, wonderfully talented people that work at Tonal, wonderfully talented people that work in [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2201.16s)]
*  the fitness industry because they're drawn to the mission and the purpose of making the world better [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2207.7999999999997s)]
*  by making people healthier. I do think that it's a really young and immature industry. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2213.48s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of evolution and change. There's going to be a ton of incremental [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2222.3599999999997s)]
*  innovation. They're still figuring out what works best for consumers. There's, I think, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2226.76s)]
*  processing the post-COVID period. COVID, in lots of cases, fundamentally changed people's behaviors. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2233.7200000000003s)]
*  I think around health and fitness fundamentally changed people's behaviors. People [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2241.8s)]
*  are more focused on their health than they were before. They really are. People's norms are still [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2246.6800000000003s)]
*  landing around work and home. People have been focused on experiences for the last couple years [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2255.56s)]
*  as a reaction to COVID and travel and things like that. I think over the next couple of years, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2264.2s)]
*  what happens is consumer preferences begin to settle into a new normal. I think long term, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2269.16s)]
*  there's tremendous massive growth in this industry. It'll benefit everybody, not just [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2277.72s)]
*  individual companies. I do think that there's a strong trend line around flexibility, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2285.96s)]
*  around how you work out and achieving your goals. I think a lot of people like putting a lot of [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2293.72s)]
*  things together, a boutique fitness class, an at-home solution, a hike. There's no one [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2300.6s)]
*  size fits all. People want to put a lot of things together. We play a specific role in enabling that [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2308.84s)]
*  convenience in the home. I think the industry is going to evolve. I think it's going to grow. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2313.24s)]
*  I think consumer preferences are going to evolve. I also think the other thing I would say is the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2318.3599999999997s)]
*  role of intelligence is going to grow. We talked about this at the beginning of the conversation. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2323.9599999999996s)]
*  What do I do? I want to be stronger. I don't know where to start. I don't know how to do it. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2330.3599999999997s)]
*  Maybe I'm advanced in my learning, but I'm hitting a plateau and I don't know how to push [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2336.68s)]
*  through the plateau. I can't figure out how to lose this last five pounds or whatever it is. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2342.68s)]
*  The intelligence that AI is going to provide for consumers is going to be massive, I think, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2348.04s)]
*  in terms of helping people figure it out. Tony's going to help out. Tony's going to help you out. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2356.8399999999997s)]
*  That's right. That's right. It's interesting. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2359.48s)]
*  And you know, it's not just ours, right? Lots of AI that people are working on. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2362.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, there's an old adage that said, if you could put exercise into a pill, it would be [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2367.0800000000004s)]
*  the largest single trillion dollar pharmaceutical ever. Exercise is really the process of telling [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2373.7200000000003s)]
*  your body, I still care, I'm still alive, I'm not ready to roll over and die yet. The [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2382.6800000000003s)]
*  stimulations that it has throughout every molecular process, it is the number one thing you can do, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2391.56s)]
*  period. And I can't stress that enough. I think about my three top priorities are exercise, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2398.52s)]
*  sleep, and minimizing sugar. And out of those, the top one is exercise. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2407.2400000000002s)]
*  I think about, I do a lot of work in the AI space. I have a venture fund there. I start companies. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2415.96s)]
*  I support entrepreneurs. And we're going to have human level AI and then digital superintelligence [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2425.32s)]
*  that will follow thereafter. And you're going to have an AI which is your physician, right? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2432.92s)]
*  It's an AI that is, you say to it, listen, I'm interested in maximizing my muscle, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2440.52s)]
*  minimizing my weight, whatever it is. I need more energy. I want to live longer. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2445.72s)]
*  And that AI is going to then guide you and try and incent you throughout the day. If you turn on, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2451.32s)]
*  bug me mode, take the stairs, don't eat that, drink more water, and it's going to be a lot of work. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2460.04s)]
*  And being able to have a tonal system that is like, you've got 15 minutes free in your [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2469.16s)]
*  calendar right now. You're doing legs. Go and jump on the tonal, right? Go see Tony. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2476.2s)]
*  But I do think that is where we're heading towards. And excited to have that kind of capability [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2485.24s)]
*  in hand for sure. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2495.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that's right. I also think, you know, we didn't talk about the GLP-1s. And all the data, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2497.7200000000003s)]
*  like just looking forward to the industry, all the data on the GLP-1s is that, you know, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2503.96s)]
*  people lose muscle mass when they go through that. And there's going to be even stronger [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2509.1600000000003s)]
*  awareness, I think, generated as a result of that, that you've got to work on building muscle mass [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2515.8s)]
*  and protecting the muscle mass you have. And so I also think that's going to be a huge, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2521.8799999999997s)]
*  you know, huge trend for the industry. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2527.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. And let me just use that. If you're on Ozempic or any of the GLP-1s, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2530.12s)]
*  please, it is a miracle drug in some ways, but the downside is loss of muscle. And again, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2537.7999999999997s)]
*  I've said this, my number one objective is maintaining and building muscle mass. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2546.92s)]
*  And you don't get it by hoping. You don't get it by just thinking about it. You actually have to do [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2553.48s)]
*  the work. So if that is you, figure out what your plan is, right? And it's either getting to the gym [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2562.12s)]
*  on a regular basis, installing a tonal in your home or office, wherever it might be. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2574.36s)]
*  It's changing your diet. It's changing your supplements, but it's mostly [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2581.8s)]
*  committing to yourself that this is important for you. And I, you know, if longevity is your [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2585.96s)]
*  objective, especially if you're, you know, in step two of your life, in your 50s or 60s or 70s, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2591.96s)]
*  and I say step two out of maybe 10, I'm hoping for long. How long do you want to live, by the way, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2600.92s)]
*  Crystal? Do you have a longevity objective? Oh my gosh. You know, that's a great question. I would [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2606.28s)]
*  say like 95. But I'd really like to have a really like strong set of healthy years after 65. Like I [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2611.0800000000004s)]
*  saw that headline in the New York Times, not that, I read the article a couple weeks ago, and it said [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2618.52s)]
*  the average American gets one healthy year after their 65th birthday. Yeah. You know, it's really, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2623.48s)]
*  it really is health span, not necessarily lifespan. You know, we just, I just announced [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2631.72s)]
*  $101 million incentive competition called the HealthSpanX Prize. And it is teams around the [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2638.68s)]
*  world focusing on reversing the ravages of aging in cognition, immune, and muscle. And so it's really [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2646.44s)]
*  how do you, how do you roll back sarcopenia by at least 10 years or 20 years? And honestly, the best [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2656.68s)]
*  way is go in with great habits and with a good amount of muscle in place and maintain that. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2666.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2673.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, there's a concept, that's a great question. I used to have a ridiculous number. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2678.1200000000003s)]
*  People on this podcast probably heard me say it a few times. But when I was in medical school years [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2682.6000000000004s)]
*  ago, I remember learning that bowhead whales could live 200 years and Greenland sharks could live 500 [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2687.7200000000003s)]
*  years. And they could have babies at a 200 year age. Imagine having more kids at 200. And I said, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2693.96s)]
*  if they can live that long, why can't we? Why can't I? And I said, it's either a hardware problem or [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2701.3199999999997s)]
*  a software problem. And this is the decade we're going to understand that. But there's a concept [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2705.9599999999996s)]
*  called longevity escape velocity. Have you heard about that concept? I have. Yeah. So right now, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2711.16s)]
*  for every year that you're alive today, science is extending your life by about a third of a year, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2717.24s)]
*  right? There are new breakthroughs in early cancer detection or in new meds or supplements and so [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2723.24s)]
*  forth. But we're in the steepest part of the acceleration on medical breakthroughs, coming [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2729.4s)]
*  from AI in particular, gene therapies and so forth, cellular medicines. And there's going to [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2736.2000000000003s)]
*  be a point in time where for every year that you're alive, science is extending your life [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2743.56s)]
*  for more than a year. And all of a sudden, you know, that's longevity escape velocity. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2747.88s)]
*  And so I changed my answer from some ridiculous hundreds of years, because if you can live that [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2752.76s)]
*  long, you could live forever. I said, my goal is to reach longevity escape velocity. So when is that [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2757.88s)]
*  likely to happen? Ray Kurzweil's prediction is 2030, right? That's six years out. Your job is [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2763.56s)]
*  to stay healthy and not die from something stupid in the interim. George Church, David Sinclair, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2771.96s)]
*  and a few others put it at 2035 to 2040. But again, that's still just 15, 16 years out. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYOetdjlnKQ&t=2778.2000000000003s)]
