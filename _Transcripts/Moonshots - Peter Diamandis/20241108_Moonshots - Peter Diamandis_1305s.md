# Elon’s Predictions For the Future: AI, Free Energy, and More | EP #129
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a fun conversation with a very special guest and someone I'm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=0.0s)]
*  proud to call a friend. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=13.0s)]
*  Welcome Elon Musk. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=15.68s)]
*  Elon, welcome to Riyadh. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=19.92s)]
*  It's been quite an incredible 90 days for you, my friend. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=26.28s)]
*  XAI Colossus came online 122 days. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=30.96s)]
*  You're about to double in size again. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=35.56s)]
*  Extraordinary success of the fifth mission of Starship and the booster capture. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=38.8s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=44.36s)]
*  The launch of CyberCab. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=45.36s)]
*  Starlink helping disaster relief, progress with Optimus, the second Neuralink human patient, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=46.96s)]
*  new record users on X. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=52.88s)]
*  And that's in 90 days. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=56.0s)]
*  I'm sure I missed a few things. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=59.56s)]
*  Yeah, I've been playing a significant role in this election. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=60.56s)]
*  I think I saw you someplace on X dealing with election issues. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about AI, which is on the tips of everybody's conversations here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=73.72s)]
*  When we spoke last in March at the Abundance Summit, your prediction was that AI was increasing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  at a rate as fast as 100 times per year and that by 2029 or 2030, we might see AI as capable [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=86.28s)]
*  as 8 billion humans. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=95.12s)]
*  Are you still seeing that pace? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=97.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's been a difficult thing to quantify exactly, but I certainly feel comfortable [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  saying that it's getting 10 times better per year, which is, let's say it's four years [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=108.22s)]
*  from now, that would mean 10,000 times better. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  So maybe 100,000. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=123.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=128.7s)]
*  I think it will be able to do anything that any human can do, possibly within the next [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=130.98s)]
*  year or two. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  And then, how much longer than that does it take to be able to do what all humans can [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=145.38s)]
*  do combined? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  Not long, probably only three years from that point. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=155.46s)]
*  So like 2029 is 28, something like that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=164.3s)]
*  The other conversation we've had, and you came out on the same side as Jeffrey Hinton [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=170.5s)]
*  in this, was 80% probability it's going to be awesome. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=176.9s)]
*  20% probability we're screwed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=181.9s)]
*  Are you still on those odds? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=184.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's most likely going to be great, and there's some chance, which could be 10 [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=187.5s)]
*  to 20%, that it goes bad. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=195.02s)]
*  The chance is not zero that it goes bad, but overall, I could say it covers 80% full is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=200.1s)]
*  one positive way to look at it, maybe 90%. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=206.94s)]
*  I like that increasing odds. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=210.26s)]
*  What keeps you up at night besides running six companies? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=213.0s)]
*  Well, waking up early to participate in talks like this one. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=218.8s)]
*  I felt very guilty asking you to do this, but thank you for joining us on the lease. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=227.48s)]
*  But in terms of worrying about the future? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=235.08s)]
*  Well, I think AI is a significant existential threat and something we should be paying close [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  attention to. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  But it's probably the most significant near-term threat. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  The longer term than that is the global population collapse. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=252.68s)]
*  Both rates have been collapsing pretty much worldwide. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=257.24s)]
*  And we're headed to a situation where, for example, based on current birth rates, South [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=261.48s)]
*  Korea would have about a third of its current population, perhaps much less. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  Europe would have about half of its current population, perhaps much less. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  And I should say those numbers are if the birth rate were suddenly to return to 2.1 [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=280.0s)]
*  per woman, which is a stability point, which it's not doing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=286.44s)]
*  So if the current compounding effect continues, you would see really many countries become [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=290.24s)]
*  five percent of their current size or less within three generations. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=302.8s)]
*  I know you've been doing your best. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=308.12s)]
*  I would consider that to be a very big, very big problem. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=309.32s)]
*  And I think for most countries, they should view the birth rate as the single biggest [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=312.92s)]
*  problem they need to solve. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=319.12s)]
*  If you don't make new humans, there's no humanity. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=322.24s)]
*  And all the policies in the world don't matter. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  I know you've been doing your part to maintain the birth rate in the U.S. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=328.56s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=332.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, you've got to walk the talk. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=334.96s)]
*  So I do have a lot of kids and I encourage others to have lots of kids. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=340.0s)]
*  But on the AI, I'm sorry to go negative on this, but what are you what are you doing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=346.36s)]
*  right now that's most important for countering that 10 percent probability of dystopian [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=351.36s)]
*  outcomes? Is there something or do you is there a regulation that you're promoting? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=358.16s)]
*  How do you think about, you know, the upside will take care of itself. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  How do you protect against the downside? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=368.48s)]
*  Well, my my thing with respect to AI safety is that you have to create a maximally truth [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=369.96s)]
*  seeking AI, which may sound obvious, but that's what I'm seeing being produced is not [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  maximally truth seeking. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=382.2s)]
*  It tends to be trained to be politically correct. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  And for a lot of the AIs that are being trained in in the San Francisco area, it's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  that they have they have taken on the philosophy of the people around them, which kind [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=396.12s)]
*  of makes sense. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=401.12s)]
*  So, you know, you have sort of a woke, nihilistic, in my opinion, philosophy that is [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=402.72s)]
*  being built into these AIs and they're being brought to say crazy things. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=412.08s)]
*  And so I think that's the kind of thing that's being taught in the AI community. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=418.96s)]
*  Or to say crazy things in some cases that are very troubling. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=424.88s)]
*  So you really want to have a maximally truth seeking AI. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=429.32s)]
*  And I can't emphasize that enough. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=432.6s)]
*  That's incredibly important. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=436.36s)]
*  And also built an AI that loves humanity. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=438.64s)]
*  And, you know, and I think these are a little concerned. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  That's why I created XAI, which is to have an AI that is maximally truth seeking, that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=446.48s)]
*  aspirationally does love humanity and will seek the best interests of humanity going [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=453.84s)]
*  forward. You know, you just tweeted that you're doubling the size of the Colossus [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=460.08s)]
*  cluster. What are your thoughts? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=466.96s)]
*  We already have with XAI the most powerful training cluster in the world. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=471.96s)]
*  And we're about to double it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  Energy is a point of conversation here. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=480.2s)]
*  How concerned are you about providing sufficient energy for the growing hungry [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=483.92s)]
*  clusters globally? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=488.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think things will things are currently. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  Triplimited or not quite triplimited. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=497.36s)]
*  There it gives the point where delimited by voltage transformers and installation. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=500.56s)]
*  And they will become limited by energy. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=506.36s)]
*  So there will be a tremendous amount of energy that's needed for for digital intelligence [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  and for. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=517.24s)]
*  And for also for electrification of transport. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  So those two things are a big deal. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=522.96s)]
*  Yeah, we need a lot of energy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=529.04s)]
*  The long term, the almost all the energy that we will get is going to come from the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=531.24s)]
*  sun. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=535.12s)]
*  So one way to look at civilization is progress on the Kardashev scale. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=537.88s)]
*  We're just barely getting to one. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=542.8s)]
*  Well, we're far from OK. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=545.56s)]
*  I think we're probably we might be close. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=547.8s)]
*  I'm not sure. It's not going to be aware of one percent on the Kardashev scale one. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=551.24s)]
*  Because because of scale one means you've you've harnessed all the power of a planet. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=555.48s)]
*  I think we I think we've probably harnessed less than one percent of the power of Earth. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=560.4000000000001s)]
*  Now, Kardashev scale two is you've harnessed all the power of your son. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=569.6400000000001s)]
*  The sun is overwhelmingly the largest source of energy in the solar system. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=574.0s)]
*  Everything else is the energy of the sun. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=579.24s)]
*  Largest source of energy in the solar system. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  Everything else is maybe amounts to about a trillion of the energy in the solar system [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=584.36s)]
*  compared to the sun. Less safely less less than a trillion of all the energy is non-sun. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=591.52s)]
*  In our solar system. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=598.6s)]
*  Yeah, we're using one eight thousandth of the sun's energy hits the surface of the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=599.8000000000001s)]
*  Earth. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=603.36s)]
*  Just that just that hits the surface of the Earth. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=605.12s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=606.96s)]
*  But and the percentage of the sun's energy that hits the surface of the Earth is [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=608.64s)]
*  is less than a trillion of the energy that the sun produces. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  So almost all energy long term will be solar. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=618.36s)]
*  We call it ground. It rounds up to 100 percent. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=622.96s)]
*  So it runs up to 100 percent. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=627.32s)]
*  That's how much of the energy in the future will be solar. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=629.36s)]
*  When you when you view things from a Kardashev standpoint. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=634.16s)]
*  You know, you know, we have a number of national leaders, corporate financial leaders from [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=637.0s)]
*  the Middle East here. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=644.48s)]
*  What's your advice to decision makers here in the room that don't want to miss the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=645.96s)]
*  AI transformation and will be part of the leadership of that AI transformation? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  Do they need to build their own clusters here? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=662.28s)]
*  Are they partnering? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think there's probably all countries will have their own clusters over [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=666.96s)]
*  time. It's currently very difficult to actually build an AI cluster and have it run. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=673.84s)]
*  It's not like just pulling a computer out of a box. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=683.32s)]
*  It's they are currently very difficult to run. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=686.48s)]
*  And you have to say, oh, you're going to be training a frontier model, because if you're [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=689.84s)]
*  training a frontier model, then you need a massive amount of compute and a level of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=696.04s)]
*  technical skill that is only a few a few companies per possess. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=701.2s)]
*  So. But over time, I think every country will have AI compute clusters. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=708.16s)]
*  It's just it's just going to be a normal thing that every country has. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=717.24s)]
*  So. Yeah. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=721.28s)]
*  So basic infrastructure for every nation, like they have an electrical grid. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=724.72s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be something like electricity or, you know, just or, you know, having an [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=729.44s)]
*  airline or something like that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=735.92s)]
*  It's every every country will have AIs or multiple AIs. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=736.96s)]
*  So. And there will be a lot of robots. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=742.2s)]
*  There'll be a lot of robots. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=748.5200000000001s)]
*  But we had way more robots than people. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=750.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, let's have that conversation a second, because people are concerned about, as you [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=752.2800000000001s)]
*  said, dwindling populations, AI and robots have potential to help support the GDP. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=757.44s)]
*  Yes. Congratulations on Optimus 2 and soon Optimus 3. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=765.32s)]
*  I your prediction on the number of robots by 2040 humanoid robots to be specific. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=770.28s)]
*  What order of magnitude? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=777.4s)]
*  By 2040. Yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=780.48s)]
*  So. I think by 2040, probably there are more humanoid robots than there are people. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=782.24s)]
*  So on the 10 billion. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  Yes. And your price point on these humanoid robots, you're you're pretty good on pricing. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=796.4s)]
*  Sometimes you're on timing. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=804.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm often optimistic on timing. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=808.0s)]
*  But although the press will report when I'm late, but not when I'm early. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=810.72s)]
*  You know, for example, our Shanghai factory, we thought it would take about a year and a half. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=818.88s)]
*  And we did it in 11 months. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=823.28s)]
*  Are you going to buy a factory? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=826.0799999999999s)]
*  We thought two years. We did it in 18 months. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=827.4s)]
*  Or the Colossus cluster. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=831.24s)]
*  Texas factory two years. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=833.0s)]
*  We did it in 14 months. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=834.1999999999999s)]
*  So I've been early actually many times. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=835.6s)]
*  It's just that it's just not reported. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=837.8s)]
*  So when I make a prediction, I try to figure out, I try to say, what is the 50th percentile [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=841.12s)]
*  likely, which means that half the time I should be wrong. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=847.12s)]
*  So I'm not sand backing, essentially. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=850.44s)]
*  So. But I think it's once you get out 2040, that's a long time from now. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=857.6s)]
*  Over 25 years. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=866.72s)]
*  There'll be at least 10 billion humanoid robots. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=869.4s)]
*  And price price. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=872.64s)]
*  Yeah. The price point will be, I think, quite low. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=874.72s)]
*  Probably. Twenty, twenty five thousand dollars for a robot that could do anything. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=877.6s)]
*  We will be in a future. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=885.72s)]
*  Assuming we are in the good path of AI. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=889.52s)]
*  I think we will be in a future of abundance. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=892.72s)]
*  Obviously, you wrote a book called Abundance. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=894.96s)]
*  So I think you would agree that that is probably the outcome. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=897.08s)]
*  Basically, anyone will anyone will be able to have any goods and services they want. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=900.64s)]
*  The actual marginal cost of goods and services will be extremely low in the future. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=905.68s)]
*  Let me. So in our last four minutes, let me change the subject to something near and [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=911.92s)]
*  dear to both of our hearts. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=916.4s)]
*  Congratulations on Starship. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=918.72s)]
*  It was literally awesome. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=921.24s)]
*  Probably the engineering feat of this decade, if not more. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=923.52s)]
*  We did that with no AI was involved in that whatsoever. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=927.4s)]
*  So I'm glad to say that we're all entirely with human brains and without AI. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  I think in the future, the AI might look at that and say, not bad for a bunch of monkeys. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=938.88s)]
*  When are we on Mars? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=944.56s)]
*  When is Starship on Mars? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=945.88s)]
*  I think we will be able to launch. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=950.24s)]
*  The next Mars window, which is in about 26, 27 months, that we're just about to start. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=952.0s)]
*  We're at the beginning of a Mars transit window now and they occur every 26 months. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=959.76s)]
*  So just over two years, we'll be sending our first uncrewed Starship to Mars. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=963.84s)]
*  And then we'll be sending our first uncrewed Starship to Mars. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=971.44s)]
*  So we're just about to start. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=975.44s)]
*  Just over two years, we'll be sending our first uncrewed Starship to Mars. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=977.0s)]
*  And then if those work out well, and we don't increment the crater accounts on Mars, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=982.0s)]
*  then we'll send humans two years after that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=988.1600000000001s)]
*  So a challenge to be on the surface of Mars before the end of the decade sounds like a [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=992.4s)]
*  reasonable proclamation for either side of the White House. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=998.5600000000001s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1007.36s)]
*  Yeah, I feel more optimistic about it with the Trump White House than a non-Trump White [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1009.44s)]
*  House, because the biggest impediment to progress that we're experiencing is [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1015.2s)]
*  regulatory, is overregulation. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  You got to keep those whales and sharks safe. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1024.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. It just takes us, I mean, it takes longer to get the permit to launch [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1027.2s)]
*  and to build a giant rocket. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1034.6799999999998s)]
*  And the bureaucracy in the US has been growing every year and has particularly grown [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1036.28s)]
*  under the Biden administration. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1043.24s)]
*  And unless we do something to scale back the overregulation, I call it sort of [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1045.3999999999999s)]
*  America is getting, and a lot of countries are getting slow strangulation from [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1053.7199999999998s)]
*  overregulation. Unless something is done to push back on that, it'll eventually become [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1057.32s)]
*  illegal to do almost any large project and we won't be able to get to Mars. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1063.88s)]
*  Last subject, congrats on the cyber cab rollout. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1069.16s)]
*  Pretty extraordinary. Kathy Woods predicted it to be, you know, multiple trillions of [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1075.5600000000002s)]
*  dollars of potential GDP growth and impact. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1080.0s)]
*  Yeah. Give us some predictions on when we'll see cyber cab, when we'll be ordering a [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1085.3600000000001s)]
*  cyber cab. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1091.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, Tesla unsupervised full self-driving. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1094.56s)]
*  We expect to be working in the US next year with the Model 3 and Y. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1101.2s)]
*  So you don't have to wait for the robot taxi or cyber cab to work for Tesla to [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1105.68s)]
*  release autonomy. We're currently expecting to exceed human safety levels in Q2 next [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1113.76s)]
*  year and then substantially go beyond that thereafter. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1120.72s)]
*  And so really, it's just a software update to the cars to be able to launch our [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1125.56s)]
*  self-driving network. So we expect to do unsupervised full self-driving and start [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1133.92s)]
*  that in California and Texas around the middle of next year. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1138.96s)]
*  And then we have seven million cars on the road. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1144.64s)]
*  We'll have nine, nine and a half million cars by the end of next year. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1149.92s)]
*  So eventually we'll have a fleet of 100 million plus vehicles and they'll all be [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1155.0800000000002s)]
*  autonomous. The cyber cab with no steering wheel or pedals, we're expecting to reach [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1161.8400000000001s)]
*  volume production in 2026. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1169.28s)]
*  So that's certainly interesting. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1172.0s)]
*  But like I said, the actual launch of a robotic taxi unsupervised full self-driving [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1175.9199999999998s)]
*  is actually next year. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1183.32s)]
*  And at the event, the Tesla autonomy event, we had 50 cars, 30 Model Ys that were [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1185.28s)]
*  driverless and 20 of the cyber cabs. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1193.9599999999998s)]
*  And so autonomy is here, is what I'm saying. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1197.16s)]
*  And yeah, and all cars will drive themselves. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1201.56s)]
*  This is a no-brainer. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1207.4s)]
*  And they'll get to where they're 10 times safer than human driven cars, which will [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1209.88s)]
*  save under a past a million lives a year, lovely. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1215.44s)]
*  And then after this starts limited production next year, 2025, and then should [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1219.6799999999998s)]
*  be in volume production in 26. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1230.1999999999998s)]
*  And then we'll grow to, I think, ultimately be the biggest product of any kind ever. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1232.3999999999999s)]
*  So I kind of agree with Arkin Vest and Cathie Wood that autonomy, like the sort of [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1239.08s)]
*  robotic taxis makes Tesla kind of like a $5 trillion company. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1247.3999999999999s)]
*  The Optimist Robot, I think, makes Tesla a $25 trillion company. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not even clear what money means in that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1257.12s)]
*  We end up in a post-capitalist society at some point. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1261.52s)]
*  Elon, you make it look easy. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1264.92s)]
*  Yeah, we do sort of end up, it does become kind of post-capitalist. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1266.0s)]
*  And like I said, and I know you agree with us that we're looking at the most likely [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mofEOSUkMpA&t=1269.3600000000001s)]
