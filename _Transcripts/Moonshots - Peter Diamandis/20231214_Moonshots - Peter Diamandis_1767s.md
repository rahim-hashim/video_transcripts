# The Simple Exercise Routine That Will Extend Your Life w/ Helen Messier | EP #77
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo)
*  My dad, you know, was getting out of his bed at night, tripped, fell, broke his pelvis, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=0.0s)]
*  ended up in the hospital. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  And a lot of times what happens next is you develop a pneumonia and then it's a slow [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=8.02s)]
*  glide to the end of your life, which happened with him. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=15.26s)]
*  Diet and sleep and, you know, all of the things, kind of the lifestyle pillars of longevity [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=18.46s)]
*  and optimal health, if you have to choose one of them, it would be exercise. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=24.2s)]
*  If you're over 60, if you exercise, you know, at least once a week, you reduce your chance [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=31.0s)]
*  of cancer threefold and you reduce your chance of all-cause mortality by 50%. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=37.36s)]
*  Most important, just move. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=43.0s)]
*  Move every day. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=45.56s)]
*  If it means just getting up and walking, that's better than nothing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=46.56s)]
*  In fact, the research shows that the biggest benefit of exercise happens for those that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=50.24s)]
*  have nothing to doing something. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=55.92s)]
*  Let's dive into one more topic in this segment of our series here, which is exercise. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=60.9s)]
*  Because I think if I were going to say that if there was one thing you could do that has [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=69.08s)]
*  the biggest impact on longevity, if you could bottle up and sell it, it would be, you know, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=76.16s)]
*  a trillion dollar blockbuster drug, it is exercise. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=82.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=86.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=87.8s)]
*  No question. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=88.8s)]
*  Oh my God, so important. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=90.6s)]
*  And yet people, yeah. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=91.6s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=92.6s)]
*  Let's dive into exercise. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=93.6s)]
*  Yeah, no, I was just going to really confirm that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=94.6s)]
*  Really if, you know, people ask if you had to choose between diet and sleep and, you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  know, all of the things, kind of the lifestyle pillars of longevity and optimal health, if [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=103.12s)]
*  you have to choose one of them, it would be exercise. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  I think that by and far can, doesn't mean go and eat at McDonald's every day and then [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  exercise, but it's so critical. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=117.96s)]
*  It's, it's in the evidence, I think it's overwhelming. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=121.32s)]
*  There's really no question. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=126.28s)]
*  You know, yes, there's controversy on what the perfect diet is. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=127.52s)]
*  Yes, there's controversy, but I don't think there's any controversy on the benefits of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=130.88s)]
*  exercise. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=135.24s)]
*  And so, you know, definitely different types of exercise. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=136.72s)]
*  You want to get cardio respiratory fitness. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=140.28s)]
*  And you know, muscles are, like we talked about at the beginning, so critical for overall [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=143.98s)]
*  longevity and they predict mortality. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=153.38s)]
*  And exercise also keeps those little mitochondria, the power plants of your cell, healthy, which [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=157.1s)]
*  is fundamental for longevity. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the number I remember recently, I was with the team from Tonal, which is a, one [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  of the products I use to get my daily exercise in. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=172.5s)]
*  And the CEO was sharing some stats that I found impressive. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=176.3s)]
*  If you're over 60 and you're listening to this podcast, if you exercise, you know, at [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=181.66s)]
*  least once a week, right, twice, twice preferably, you reduce your chance of cancer threefold [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=186.46s)]
*  and you reduce your chance of all cause mortality by 50%. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=195.94s)]
*  I mean, it's a huge, huge difference. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=199.94000000000003s)]
*  So that's pretty amazing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  It is amazing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  And I think a lot of that benefit comes from the muscle mass. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  And I think muscle mass, a lot of the benefit of having the muscle mass is because muscle [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=210.5s)]
*  contains a lot of mitochondria. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=215.3s)]
*  So every cell in our body contains mitochondria, right, the power plants. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=217.66000000000003s)]
*  The muscle, brain, the tissues in our body that need the most energy are the brain, the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=223.22s)]
*  muscles, and they are the ones that contain the most mitochondria. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=230.46s)]
*  Wouldn't it be great if you could like make more brain? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=233.94s)]
*  You just make more brain connections, but not more brain cells. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the other thing that muscle contains a lot of is stem cells, which are important. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=248.38s)]
*  So let's talk about, you know, when I, what we wrote in Longevity Practical Playbook is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=249.82s)]
*  a focus on muscle, overall muscle mass, and then also VO2 max in your sort of your, you [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=257.62s)]
*  know, cardiovascular side. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=268.74s)]
*  So let's dive into muscle mass. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  So I'm on a mission to add, you know, 10 pounds in this calendar year. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=273.38s)]
*  And I've gotten about plus six and I'm pushing hard to get there by A360 next year. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=278.82s)]
*  And I don't think there's any substitution for building muscle mass other than really [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=286.14s)]
*  working out. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=293.9s)]
*  I mean, I wish there was a pill, maybe someday there will be a pill. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=295.34s)]
*  I keep on, I've made a few investments in startups that are, again, sarcopenia. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=299.3s)]
*  Sarc is the term for muscle loss as you age, you lose muscle mass over time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=306.82s)]
*  You know, we've just announced an XPRIZE, one of the parameters that teams are working [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=312.74s)]
*  on is reversing your muscle loss by 20, as much as 20 years. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=319.18s)]
*  But it comes down to actually doing the work. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  You can supplement that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=333.26s)]
*  You can make it easier for yourself. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=334.26s)]
*  But let's talk about what it takes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=335.26s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you can. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=337.7s)]
*  There's some really innovative biotech startups now, as you know, Peter, that are, I think, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=339.02s)]
*  from stem cell secretions to, you know, the really amazing work being done that is shown [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  to increase muscle mass. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=351.78s)]
*  Now, even in those cases, it's still important to use your muscles to stimulate them. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=358.9s)]
*  No matter what you have to move, if you sit on a, in a bed, bed rest or sitting on a couch, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=360.73999999999995s)]
*  you're going to lose muscle mass very quickly. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=366.73999999999995s)]
*  So most important, just move, no matter what you do. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=368.85999999999996s)]
*  Move every day. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=373.7s)]
*  If it means just getting up and walking, that's better than nothing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=374.82s)]
*  In fact, the research shows that the biggest benefit of exercise happens for those that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=378.41999999999996s)]
*  have nothing to doing something. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=384.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=385.9s)]
*  So zero to one. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=386.9s)]
*  Zero to one. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=388.17999999999995s)]
*  Just getting up off the couch, you're going to get huge benefit. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=389.34s)]
*  Then, you know, obviously you get more benefit incrementally more as you, as you work harder. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=392.9s)]
*  But doing weight training, I think is really important. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=398.82s)]
*  I, you know, we can talk about how we really build mitochondria and make them more efficient [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=401.5s)]
*  by doing zone two training. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=407.62s)]
*  So the way I like to think of how much to exercise, what you should do is, is think [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=409.76s)]
*  of your base, your foundation is that zone two. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=415.05999999999995s)]
*  Now zone two is the rate of exercise. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=418.58s)]
*  It's typically a fast walk for most people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=422.9s)]
*  It's where your heart rate is such that, you know, when you're at rest, we've mentioned [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=426.18s)]
*  that your mitochondria like to burn fat. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=430.86s)]
*  As you start to work out and you demand more energy, right. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=434.3s)]
*  So when you're burning fat, you're using oxygen to, to burn and make that energy. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=438.46s)]
*  As you start to work out more and you have more demands for more energy on your, your [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=444.4s)]
*  body needs, your muscles need more energy, that more ATP, your mitochondria can't keep [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=449.64s)]
*  up. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=455.2s)]
*  And so they're going to switch from oxygen and fat to burning glucose, right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=456.2s)]
*  So something called glycolysis and carbohydrate, that point at which they switch from fat to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=460.76s)]
*  glucose burning, you know, sort of without oxygen, that's what makes lactate, right. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=466.35999999999996s)]
*  We've all heard of lactic acid in our muscles when we work out too hard. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=471.6s)]
*  So that lactate threshold, so to speak, when you start making lactate switching, that's [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=475.32s)]
*  your zone two. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=479.96s)]
*  Now Inigo Sanmilan has published some amazing research on this and he's shown that that's [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=481.52s)]
*  what increases mitochondrial efficiency. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=487.06s)]
*  So doing that for about four hours a week, that zone two, it's really easy to do, right. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=490.08s)]
*  You can do it on your treadmill in front of your desk if you need to. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=494.88s)]
*  And then on top of that, you want to do some weightlifting. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=498.92s)]
*  So let's continue on zone two one second, because I have, I'm staring here at a Techno [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=502.76s)]
*  Gym bike that I take my Zoom meetings on, you know, I'm sitting on too many boards and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=507.48s)]
*  I have these boring board meetings. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=514.0s)]
*  And so unless I'm presenting, I'm going to be on a bike doing something else. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=516.6s)]
*  Or you know, during COVID, I took all of my meetings as walking meetings. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  I live in Santa Monica. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to take advantage of the situation. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  And it's, you know, but for me, you can calculate your zone two heart rate. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=530.4000000000001s)]
*  You can get it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=537.6400000000001s)]
*  There's ways to do it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=538.6400000000001s)]
*  But your zone two heart rate for me, I'm just going to read this out loud here. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=539.6400000000001s)]
*  So first of all, calculate your maximum heart rate. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=544.36s)]
*  It's 220 minus your age. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=548.2s)]
*  So for me, I'm 62. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=550.88s)]
*  So my maximum heart rate is 158. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=553.84s)]
*  I think that's reasonably stands up to my experience of my maximum heart rate. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=558.08s)]
*  So 220 minus your age. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=563.52s)]
*  Then calculate your lower limit of zone two, which is your maximum heart rate times 60%. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=565.68s)]
*  So that comes out to 100. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=573.92s)]
*  And then calculate your upper limit, which is your maximum heart rate times 70%, which [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=575.72s)]
*  is 110. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=580.64s)]
*  So I find 110 as that level where I'm, you know, having a little bit difficulty talking [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=581.92s)]
*  on the bike. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=590.84s)]
*  And so my technogen bike has a heart rate monitor or I'll wear one and I'll get myself [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=592.64s)]
*  there and keep myself going. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=600.88s)]
*  Now what happens at zone two besides the switch from fat to glucose? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=603.12s)]
*  Are we stimulating the growth of more mitochondria or making the ones we have more efficient? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=608.48s)]
*  Both actually. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=614.88s)]
*  So what you're doing is you're sending a signal to the cell, to your body to say, I can't [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=616.2s)]
*  keep up with the energy demand. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=621.84s)]
*  And so that's the purpose of exercise, the purpose of, we can get into the phytonutrients [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=624.2s)]
*  too. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  Basically, sometimes they're negative stimulators, meaning your body has to respond in order [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  to meet the demands that you're making. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=635.92s)]
*  Even with weight training, you're inducing small tears in your muscle, which actually [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=638.68s)]
*  the, when your body repairs, it makes you stronger, right? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=643.6s)]
*  So exercise can be damaging. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=646.96s)]
*  So what you're doing is you're stimulating your body to make more mitochondria and you're [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=648.98s)]
*  stimulating them to be more efficient when you do that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=653.68s)]
*  So it's, it's, your body's just trying to meet the demands. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=657.48s)]
*  Now, if you go too far and you, you know, that's important too, to get to that VO2 max. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=660.48s)]
*  And we'll, we'll talk about that in a minute, but you don't want to do the vast majority [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=666.6s)]
*  of your training at that level. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=670.4s)]
*  You know, that intense, intense VO2 sort of that level of maximum consumption of oxygen. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=672.08s)]
*  It's important to do that because the VO2 max does correlate with longevity. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=679.6s)]
*  There's no question, but you do also cause a lot of those free radicals, a lot of oxidative [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=683.96s)]
*  damage. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=689.76s)]
*  So you don't want to do that too often, but you want to get that foundation of just stimulating [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=690.76s)]
*  enough, but not too much to damage. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=697.24s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=699.88s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=703.4s)]
*  love. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=708.52s)]
*  The company is called Fountain Life and it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=709.52s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=714.2s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=716.44s)]
*  We're all optimists until that day where you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=721.12s)]
*  in the emergency room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=726.4000000000001s)]
*  stage three or four going on. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=730.48s)]
*  And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=732.6400000000001s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time, but because we never look, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=735.4000000000001s)]
*  we don't find out. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=740.96s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=742.48s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=747.94s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=752.72s)]
*  CT, looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=759.04s)]
*  blood workup. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=764.76s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=766.14s)]
*  250 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=769.56s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=779.4399999999999s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=781.3599999999999s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=783.68s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=786.5799999999999s)]
*  to your life and we provide them to you at our centers. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=790.4799999999999s)]
*  So if this is of interest to you, please go and check it out. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=795.36s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=800.12s)]
*  When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=804.3000000000001s)]
*  to us for Fountain Life memberships. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=810.34s)]
*  If you go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter, we'll put you to the top of the list. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=812.48s)]
*  Really it's something that is for me one of the most important things I offer my entire [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=818.4s)]
*  family, the CEOs of my companies, my friends. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=824.16s)]
*  It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=827.16s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=832.4399999999999s)]
*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=834.4399999999999s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=838.8s)]
*  So you mentioned the amount of zone two, not to be confused with VO2 max zone two exercise, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=840.6s)]
*  right? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=846.8s)]
*  And for me, it's 110 beats per minute. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=847.9599999999999s)]
*  How many hours and how much chunk at a time? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=852.64s)]
*  So what's the minimum there you need to be hitting? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=856.68s)]
*  Yeah, you really want to strive for about four hours a week. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=859.4s)]
*  You can divide it up into four one-hour sessions. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=864.3399999999999s)]
*  You can do 30-minute sessions, 45, whatever works. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=866.88s)]
*  It doesn't really matter that it's all in one go. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  But if you can get about three, but ideally four hours a week is really what you want [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=872.78s)]
*  to strive for in the zone two. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=878.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=882.06s)]
*  And then there's one other layer which you've talked about, which is interval training. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=883.06s)]
*  So what's that mean? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=887.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the interval training or the HIIT training, that's when you push your heart rate really [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=890.4599999999999s)]
*  to its maximum or close to its maximum, 80% of its maximum. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=896.3s)]
*  And that, again, that also stimulates cardiorespiratory fitness. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=901.5s)]
*  That's really important. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=906.58s)]
*  And we do know that VO2 max, when you work out at that level, you increase your ability [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=908.22s)]
*  to work out harder and faster at that level. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=912.7s)]
*  You increase your VO2 max over time. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=915.46s)]
*  So that again has been associated with longevity, right? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=918.28s)]
*  People that have a higher, better VO2 max have a much lower risk of dying. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=921.76s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=926.94s)]
*  One of the reasons, unfortunately, that people who've got sarcopenia, reduced muscle pass, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=928.9399999999999s)]
*  and it's something, unfortunately, I suffered with, lost my dad and many people have, which [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=937.98s)]
*  is as you get older and you've lost muscle mass, it becomes easier to trip and fall and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=944.5799999999999s)]
*  break your hip or your pelvis. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=952.78s)]
*  My dad was getting out of his bed at night to go to the restroom, tripped, fell, broke [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=955.62s)]
*  his pelvis, ended up in the hospital. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=962.5s)]
*  And a lot of times what happens next is you develop a pneumonia and then it's a slow glide [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=966.22s)]
*  to the end of your life, which happened with him. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=974.14s)]
*  And the numbers are staggering for people who, after the age of 60, I think, end up [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=977.5s)]
*  breaking their hip or pelvis, there's a large percentage that don't make it back. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=984.7199999999999s)]
*  And what you really want is have the strength to catch yourself, the strength to not trip [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=989.3199999999999s)]
*  and fall. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=994.0799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=995.0799999999999s)]
*  It's all far, far too common, right? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  People they get sarcopenia or loss of muscle mass, which goes along with loss of bone mass, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=998.5999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1004.16s)]
*  Osteopenia or osteoporosis. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1005.16s)]
*  And when you do slip and fall, you end up breaking a bone. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1007.3599999999999s)]
*  Again, that is the end for kind of that long, slow decline for far, far too many people. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1011.36s)]
*  And so you definitely need the muscle mass. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1017.28s)]
*  But also it's important to work on kind of flexibility and remember that it's our nervous [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1020.8s)]
*  system that controls our muscles as well. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1026.24s)]
*  And so before you start working out, you really want to assess whether you have any dysfunctional [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1029.48s)]
*  movement patterns as well. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1035.48s)]
*  So if you're moving in a slightly off pattern over time, if you're walking a lot or doing [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1037.48s)]
*  something that can lead to injury. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  And once you get injured, it's really hard to keep up that exercise. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1045.72s)]
*  So really important to assess that, get a functional movement screen done. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1050.5s)]
*  I think that's really important for most people. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1056.04s)]
*  And then just get that neurological connection from your brain to your muscles in your body. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1058.88s)]
*  A lot of us have lost that. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1063.6s)]
*  As we're kids, when we learn to move, we start crawling, right? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1066.52s)]
*  That crawling is such a great neurological muscle integration. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1072.3s)]
*  A lot of times I get people back on the ground starting to crawl again. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1076.8799999999999s)]
*  There's a great book called Original Strength that really talks about that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1081.1999999999998s)]
*  And even kids that have skipped the crawling phase, they go from the bum scooching to the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1085.84s)]
*  walking right away. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  They tend to have problems later in life because they didn't actually do that neurological [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  integration. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1096.56s)]
*  Sometimes we get people back to rolling, right? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1098.28s)]
*  Just basics. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1100.96s)]
*  Try rolling on the ground without using your arms and see if you can do that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1101.96s)]
*  A lot of people have lost the ability to- [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1107.6s)]
*  I'll go check right now. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1108.6s)]
*  Yeah, but getting up without using your hands to a standing position is something you lose [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1109.6s)]
*  fairly quickly along the way. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1114.8s)]
*  I think one of the points that is really important for people to hear is the biggest challenge [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1117.56s)]
*  we have as we age is injury. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1124.28s)]
*  You may be in great shape, but you fall, you tear a ligament, you break a bone, and it [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1130.12s)]
*  ends you up in bed rest and sarcopenia. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1139.28s)]
*  It is difficult to recover after that. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1145.7800000000002s)]
*  So minimizing injury is super important. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1147.7800000000002s)]
*  That comes from flexibility. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1151.98s)]
*  It comes from, like you said, just coordination. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1153.72s)]
*  Like I say, we'll talk about this later, not doing stupid things. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1159.22s)]
*  Not doing stupid things, yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1163.0200000000002s)]
*  One of the things I think that people also confuse sometimes is flexibility versus stability. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1165.0600000000002s)]
*  This was a great example of, I took a functional movement screen course a number of years ago, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1172.3s)]
*  and there was a physiotherapist there that could not bring his hand up his back. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1178.06s)]
*  He couldn't touch his shoulder blades if he put his hand behind his back and lifted it [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1183.1399999999999s)]
*  up, and he thought it was a flexibility problem. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1186.6599999999999s)]
*  So he spent years doing towel stretches and trying to get him more flexible. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1189.6599999999999s)]
*  With assessment, it turned out it was a stability problem, and he actually wasn't, his brain [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1195.18s)]
*  was not stabilizing his shoulder blade before he could move his arm. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1200.94s)]
*  And once we taught about five minutes of teaching his brain to stabilize, he had full range [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1205.1399999999999s)]
*  of motion again. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1210.26s)]
*  So sometimes it's surprising, and so that movement patterns are really important. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1211.66s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1217.3799999999999s)]
*  I want to take a quick break from this episode to tell you about a health product that I [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1218.3799999999999s)]
*  love and that I use every day. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1222.46s)]
*  In fact, I use it twice a day. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1225.22s)]
*  It's Seeds DSO-1 Daily Symbiotic. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1227.66s)]
*  Hopefully by now you understand that your microbiome and your gut health are one of [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1231.18s)]
*  the most important modifiable parts of your health. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1234.8600000000001s)]
*  Your gut microbiome is connected to everything, your brain health, your cardiac health, your [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1238.02s)]
*  metabolic health. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1242.46s)]
*  So the question is, what are you doing to optimize your gut? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1243.46s)]
*  Let me take a moment to tell you about what I'm doing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1246.46s)]
*  Every day I take two capsules of Seeds DSO-1 Daily Symbiotic. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1249.26s)]
*  It's a two-in-one probiotic and prebiotic formulation that supports digestive health, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1254.22s)]
*  gut health, skin health, heart health, and more. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1260.02s)]
*  It contains 24 clinically and scientifically proven probiotic strains that are delivered [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1262.46s)]
*  in a patented capsule that actually protects the contents from your stomach acid and ensures [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1268.06s)]
*  that 100% of it is survivable, reaching your colon. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1274.06s)]
*  Now if you want to try Seeds DSO-1 Daily Symbiotic for yourself, you can get 25% off your first [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1277.46s)]
*  month's supply by using the code Peter25 at checkout. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1284.02s)]
*  Just go to seed.com slash moonshots and enter the code Peter25 at checkout. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1288.26s)]
*  That's seed.com slash moonshots and use the code Peter25 to get your 25% off the first [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1294.26s)]
*  month of Seeds Daily Symbiotic. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1301.46s)]
*  Trust me, your gut will thank you. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1303.78s)]
*  All right, let's go back to the episode. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1305.94s)]
*  Anything else on exercise that you want to, let's talk about one last element here, which [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1308.1s)]
*  is if you're trying to build muscle mass, let's talk about the supplements or what you [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1313.2s)]
*  recommend for building muscle mass. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1320.64s)]
*  So we've talked about protein, talked about 0.8 to 1 gram per body pound weight. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1323.04s)]
*  So I'm 150 pounds, I'm taking 150 grams. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  I'll do that with a neutral leaven shake and then a kachava shake and then some fish and [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1333.0s)]
*  then some chicken. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1338.4s)]
*  And I attack my protein. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1340.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't eat red meat for a number of reasons. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1342.64s)]
*  We can not talk about that right now, but what are the other elements? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  Creatine, other supplements, protein, I mean amino acids, what are your thoughts there? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1358.92s)]
*  Yeah, so definitely like we talked about, get enough protein. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1363.96s)]
*  Your muscles are made of protein. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1367.8400000000001s)]
*  There's other things you can do like creatine. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1370.16s)]
*  Creatine is an energy source for your muscles. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1372.68s)]
*  Your body is going to make creatine because it's so important. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1375.96s)]
*  But when it makes creatine, it uses up a lot of capacity. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1380.78s)]
*  So we've probably all heard of methylation, right? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1385.5800000000002s)]
*  The ability to add methyl groups to a lot of different things in our body, including [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1388.5600000000002s)]
*  DNA, which controls DNA expression. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1393.64s)]
*  So we use methylation to make neurotransmitters, to make new DNA and RNA and new cells essentially. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1397.04s)]
*  And so we also need methylation to make creatine. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1403.36s)]
*  And when your body, if you're working out a lot, you are going to be using up quite [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1407.12s)]
*  a bit of creatine. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1411.72s)]
*  And so you need, if you, it's fine, your body will make it, but then it uses up from other [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1413.24s)]
*  areas where you need that methylation capacity. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1417.6s)]
*  And so taking the creatine supplies that very, very safe. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1420.88s)]
*  And it frees it up for your body to do other things with the methylation. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1426.24s)]
*  How much creatine should you take? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1430.0s)]
*  Yeah, around five grams or so. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1432.0s)]
*  Five grams, I'm sorry. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1435.1200000000001s)]
*  And again, creatine is really easy to get. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1437.16s)]
*  It's kind of flavorless. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1440.9s)]
*  You can add it to any shake, put it in water. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1442.0400000000002s)]
*  One of the easiest things you can take. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1446.0800000000002s)]
*  Great. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1447.8400000000001s)]
*  What else? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1448.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, looking at, you could do free-form amino acids if you want. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1450.08s)]
*  But I think if you eat enough protein, you're probably good with that. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1455.1999999999998s)]
*  And then the other things to support your mitochondria. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1460.04s)]
*  You know, that will help you build muscle and help you exercise more as well. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1463.48s)]
*  And your mitochondria need a lot of support. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1468.1599999999999s)]
*  They need your B vitamins, you need your antioxidants, coenzyme Q10. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1470.9199999999998s)]
*  Magnesium is a big one. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1476.76s)]
*  A lot of us are magnesium deficient. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1478.16s)]
*  If we get that tightness in our muscles, you know, if you get a tightness in your neck [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1480.88s)]
*  or tightness, that's often you're not having enough magnesium. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1484.68s)]
*  Because calcium helps your muscles contract and magnesium helps them relax. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1488.8000000000002s)]
*  And so I'd say 85% of us are deficient in magnesium. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1493.6000000000001s)]
*  And we need it every day. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1498.18s)]
*  And the more stress we're under, the more we need it. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1499.64s)]
*  And we'll talk about peptides when we get to meds and supplements and peptides a little [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1502.0s)]
*  bit later. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1507.68s)]
*  But there are some peptides that can support muscle growth as well. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1508.68s)]
*  How about testosterone for men who are? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1511.72s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, definitely keeping your hormones in an optimal range. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1514.52s)]
*  As we get older, testosterone for men, estrogen, progesterone for women, I think are really [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1519.16s)]
*  low hanging fruit when it comes to longevity. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1527.04s)]
*  Both of them support muscle mass, bone mass, and brain health, cardiovascular health. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1531.0800000000002s)]
*  So that's really a no brainer. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1536.12s)]
*  Helen, thank you for this conversation on diet and exercise. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1538.4s)]
*  When we get together next, we'll jump into sleep, what we call our annual found upload. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1543.56s)]
*  How do you image and diagnose yourself? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1550.88s)]
*  What can you know about what's going on in your body? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtkGmpIqkJo&t=1553.28s)]
