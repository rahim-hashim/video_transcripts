# I'm Working with OpenAI to Make Work Better for Humans w/ Arianna Huffington | EP #126
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8)
*  We have a healthcare crisis, I think is the way that you put it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=0.0s)]
*  It isn't just a US crisis, it's a global crisis. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3.36s)]
*  It's infinitely preventable and or reversible. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=7.2s)]
*  We are not going to change hearts and minds through numbers. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=12.92s)]
*  We need to tell stories. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=17.68s)]
*  I wanted to do something more. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=19.48s)]
*  I wanted to help people change behaviors. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=21.52s)]
*  Elevating these issues from the warm and fuzzy, nice to have, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=24.36s)]
*  to kind of business imperatives. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=31.04s)]
*  We call them productivity multipliers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=33.44s)]
*  What CEO wouldn't want to maintain productivity multipliers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=36.56s)]
*  even when you're cutting budgets? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Ray's belief is that we are going to merge with AI. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=44.4s)]
*  I completely disagree with him. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  I think that human beings have a soul and AI does it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=51.0s)]
*  Everybody, welcome to Moonshots. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=61.2s)]
*  On today's program, I'm going to be interviewing an incredible female CEO, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=63.04s)]
*  a dear friend, Arianna Huffington. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=67.56s)]
*  She is the founder and CEO of Thrive Global. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=69.88s)]
*  We'll be talking about how she's looking at revolutionizing the entire healthcare industry. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=73.16s)]
*  She was also the founder of Huffington Post, which she started in 2005, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=77.76s)]
*  leading to winning a Pulitzer Prize. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=83.0s)]
*  She sold that company to AOL in 2011, then went on to start Thrive Global in 2016. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  She's the author of 15 books, Thrive and The Sleep Revolution. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=91.52s)]
*  She's incredible and then went on to partner with Sam Altman and OpenAI [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=95.6s)]
*  to create Thrive AI Health. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=99.84s)]
*  By the way, Arianna Huffington is going to be with me on stage [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=102.2s)]
*  at my private event, Abundance 360, next March. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=105.8s)]
*  I usually don't open it up to the public, but if you're interested, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=109.24s)]
*  I do reserve five tickets for Moonshot listeners. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=113.16s)]
*  If this is you and you want to talk to my team about it, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=116.36s)]

*  All right, let's jump into the episode. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=123.96s)]
*  Hi, Arianna. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=126.12s)]
*  Hi, Peter. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  How are you? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=130.12s)]
*  How are you? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm very good. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=132.88s)]
*  This is going to be conducted in Greek, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=134.4s)]
*  We're going to translate this podcast, this Moonshot podcast, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=137.28s)]
*  goes out in Portuguese, and we're going to put it out, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=140.52s)]
*  this one in particular, in Greek, so we won't have to translate that part. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=143.24s)]
*  But it's great to see you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=147.04s)]
*  I'm in Santa Monica at this moment, yourself in New York. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  And I'm in New York. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=152.16s)]
*  But as you know, I spent quite a bit of time in LA. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=153.44s)]
*  I still have my home there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=156.88s)]
*  How long have we known each other now? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=159.68s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=161.8s)]
*  We met shortly after I launched the Huffington Post [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  at a dinner that Larry and Sergey had for you in San Francisco. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=169.68s)]
*  And you invited me to join the board of ex-price. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=176.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=181.24s)]
*  So it must have been 2004. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  So Larry joined at the end of late 2004, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  which is probably when I invited you as well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  We had quite the board. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=193.16s)]
*  We had you and Larry. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  Elon was on the board. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=196.88s)]
*  We brought Jim Giannopoulos. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=199.16s)]
*  James Cameron had joined. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=201.12s)]
*  He was quite a rock star. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  The board grew to like 25 people, to the point [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=204.12s)]
*  where I couldn't call a board meeting anymore [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=206.88s)]
*  because it was impossible to get everybody's schedule aligned. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=208.72s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=211.4s)]
*  But now, man. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=213.8s)]
*  Amazing, great, amazing board meetings. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=214.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know that this year, Ariana, is our 30th anniversary. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=217.96s)]
*  So we've known each other for 20 years. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=222.2s)]
*  Happy anniversary. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=224.28s)]
*  Happy anniversary. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=225.44s)]
*  Our friendship has lasted longer than my marriage. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  That's good. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=231.44s)]
*  It only lasted 11 years. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=232.44s)]
*  Your marriage has been much more successful. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  Marriage is tough. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=238.44s)]
*  It's part of the stressors in our health. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  But it's an important part of our health as well. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=242.16s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=246.2s)]
*  This is our 30th anniversary, Ariana. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  We've launched 30 X prizes, about close to $600 million [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=250.64s)]
*  in cash purses, driving nearly $10 billion in R&D. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=256.28s)]
*  So I'm very proud of what we all created together. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=262.52s)]
*  It's been quite the journey. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm very proud of you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=268.4s)]
*  It's been really incredible. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  And I'm proud of you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=271.8s)]
*  Man, you are quite the entrepreneur, young lady. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=272.8s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=276.4s)]
*  In your intro, I was just noting all of the different successes [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=277.8s)]
*  you had. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=282.2s)]
*  And one of the things, we're going to get into health care, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=283.44s)]
*  how insane our health care system is, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=288.68s)]
*  how broken it is, the importance of using tech and AI [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=291.32s)]
*  to bolster us, and what you're doing with Thrive Global. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  But I want to hit something else. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=302.12s)]
*  A lot of our listeners around the world are entrepreneurs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=304.4s)]
*  And we're so driven. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=307.6s)]
*  And in our early entrepreneurial careers, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  you at Huffington Post, myself at XPRIZE, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=315.92s)]
*  and my other space ventures, where you've [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  got this insane dream, this moonshot you're going after. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=325.6s)]
*  And you're willing to work at it 24-7 [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  and sacrifice everything to it, relationships and health. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  What advice do you have for entrepreneurs in that mind? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=338.12s)]
*  Well, my advice came from my own experience [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=342.6s)]
*  and from tons of science and data. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=346.56s)]
*  Two years into building the Huffington Post in 2007, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=349.92s)]
*  I had bought into this collective delusion, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=355.68s)]
*  as I call it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  I love that, collective delusion. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=359.68s)]
*  In order to be the super founder and super mom [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=361.08s)]
*  of my two little girls, I didn't have the luxury [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=365.12s)]
*  to take care of myself. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=369.28s)]
*  Sleep, to eat right, exercise, et cetera. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=371.56s)]
*  And I literally collapsed. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=375.12s)]
*  I hit my head on my desk, broke my cheekbone. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=376.88s)]
*  And that was the beginning of my journey. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=380.32s)]
*  To not just change my own behavior, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=383.88s)]
*  but become an evangelist about encouraging entrepreneurs [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=386.56s)]
*  and others to really look at the data and the science. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=390.6s)]
*  It's kind of ironic, Peter, because as entrepreneurs, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  we are very data-driven. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=399.68s)]
*  We look at all the metrics. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=401.76000000000005s)]
*  And yet, when it comes to the unequivocal science [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=404.48s)]
*  that we are going to be the most productive, most creative [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  versions of ourselves, if we also take care of ourselves, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  we tend to ignore it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=418.44s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=420.28s)]
*  You think of it for somebody else and not for myself. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=421.76s)]
*  And in fact, if everybody else is doing it, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=425.08s)]
*  but I push a little bit further, I'll be able to get ahead. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=428.64s)]
*  So at the Huffington Post, after my own collapse, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=433.11999999999995s)]
*  I started covering these issues exhaustively. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  And I remember sitting at a dinner with Jeff Bezos. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=440.96s)]
*  And he said to me, I had just written my book on sleep. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=444.0s)]
*  And he said, you know, I sleep for eight hours a night. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=448.32s)]
*  I said, you do? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=452.56s)]
*  He said, yes. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=453.8s)]
*  He said, I have analyzed my decisions. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=454.64s)]
*  And when I'm sleep deprived, my decisions [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=459.2s)]
*  are not as good as I have gotten a good full night's sleep. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=462.32s)]
*  And he said, as a CEO of Amazon, which he still was at the time, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=467.28s)]
*  I'm judged by the quality of my decisions, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=472.32s)]
*  not the quantity of my decisions. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=477.32s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=480.28s)]
*  That's actually brilliant of him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=482.08s)]
*  It is amazing. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=484.04s)]
*  And I said to him, you must write about it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=484.92s)]
*  He said, no, I'm private. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=489.08s)]
*  I don't want to write about it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=490.24s)]
*  He said, it's not about you. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=491.48s)]
*  It's about teaching people who admire you, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=494.44s)]
*  admire your success, how to do it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=498.64s)]
*  And finally, after I kept texting him for three months, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=502.32s)]
*  he did it, I think, to get me off his back. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=507.48s)]
*  And then CNBC picked it up, different business publications. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=510.44s)]
*  It became a part of the culture. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  So Satya Nadella is another one who talks about how much sleep [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=520.6s)]
*  he gets. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=525.08s)]
*  I was at a Microsoft CEO summit. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=525.72s)]
*  And he came up to me and he said, you know, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=529.6s)]
*  I didn't get all the sleep I wanted last night. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=531.92s)]
*  So I won't be my best. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=535.68s)]
*  So these are people who are incredibly effective, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  incredibly successful, who also know that if they take time [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=542.76s)]
*  to unplug, recharge, they're going to be the best versions [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=549.68s)]
*  of themselves. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=553.76s)]
*  And also, Peter, we see that from athletes, right? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=554.88s)]
*  And I think that's the way that elite athletes know [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=559.52s)]
*  that recovery is part of peak performance. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=564.16s)]
*  It is. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  And I changed my tune all through medical school, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  all through graduate school. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=573.72s)]
*  And the first 20 years of an entrepreneurship, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=576.16s)]
*  I'll sleep when I'm dead was my motto. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  And it was like minimizing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=581.76s)]
*  I remember having lunch with you at the Crosby Hotel in New [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=583.72s)]
*  York, and I was like, I'm going to be a little bit [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=588.88s)]
*  too much because you are rushing to get a plane. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  And I was trying to convince you of that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=595.52s)]
*  And you were like on the edge. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=597.8s)]
*  I think soon after that, you were convinced. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=599.88s)]
*  But you know, you are really a hardcore I'll sleep when I'm [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  dead guy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=607.64s)]
*  Yeah, my dad used to say, your fork is on fire. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, the prunus and a Nabi. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=613.24s)]
*  And I was just judging everything incorrectly. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=617.4s)]
*  And today I'm in bed at 930 every night and, you know, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=622.04s)]
*  consistency of sleep cycle and eight hours is my objective [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=628.24s)]
*  every single day. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=632.6s)]
*  I mean, I always get it, but it's my objective. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=633.6s)]
*  And I can feel my next day if I don't. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=636.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=640.4s)]
*  And in particular, it's not just the eight hours, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=641.4s)]
*  it's trying to get an hour of deep sleep at least. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=643.0s)]
*  I think what you said is very important. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=646.6800000000001s)]
*  There are going to be nights when we don't get it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=650.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=652.9200000000001s)]
*  This is not about doing this perfectly. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=653.96s)]
*  We are all wax in progress. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=656.6s)]
*  And the worst thing we can do is judge ourselves [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=659.08s)]
*  when we don't get it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=661.6s)]
*  You know, judgment, and we'll talk about this later. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=664.36s)]
*  We judge ourselves. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=668.08s)]
*  Humans around us inherently judge us and we each other. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=670.2s)]
*  And the beautiful thing about AI is it doesn't judge you. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=675.5200000000001s)]
*  That's one of the most spectacular things. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=680.44s)]
*  There's not that sense of, oh no, I have to lie to it [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=683.0s)]
*  because it will think badly of me. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=686.88s)]
*  You know, you can be completely honest and, you know, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=689.12s)]
*  it's going to be empathic and sympathetic [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=691.72s)]
*  and we'll get to that in a little bit. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=693.76s)]
*  I want to start with, you and I have a common passion [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=695.6400000000001s)]
*  and belief that we need to completely destroy [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=700.84s)]
*  obliterate, burn down and sprinkle holy water [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=705.88s)]
*  on the current healthcare system. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=708.04s)]
*  And it needs to be reinvented because it is, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=711.24s)]
*  and I won't say that as dramatically, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  but the healthcare system is broken and the numbers, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=718.8s)]
*  and it's not just healthcare, it's the food system [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=723.0799999999999s)]
*  and it's many different elements of our society. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=727.48s)]
*  We are, we have a healthcare crisis, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=731.36s)]
*  I think is the way that you put it, right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=734.16s)]
*  And I wrote down a few stats and I know you have [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=736.68s)]
*  some of your favorites too. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=740.48s)]
*  And again, because we're speaking to entrepreneurs [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=742.56s)]
*  going after moon shots, I think one of the biggest [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=746.0s)]
*  opportunities on the planet is the fixing [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=748.76s)]
*  this healthcare crisis and delivering new systems, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=753.24s)]
*  new capabilities. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=757.92s)]
*  And I'd like to give some of the stats as motivations [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=759.4s)]
*  if you don't mind. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=763.4s)]
*  I'm happy to go first, if you have your favorites, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=766.16s)]
*  you can go as well. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=769.36s)]
*  I've written things down, I don't know if you have [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=771.4s)]
*  these memorized or not, but it's crazy. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=774.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, we should stress because this is [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=777.08s)]
*  a global audience, that it isn't just a US crisis, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=779.6s)]
*  it's a global crisis. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=783.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  We have over eight million people in line for healthcare [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=786.92s)]
*  in the United Kingdom. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=794.08s)]
*  We spend 18% of our GDP, $4 trillion in the US [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=797.72s)]
*  on healthcare and outcomes are getting worse every year. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=809.04s)]
*  I mean, we work at Thrive with many self-insured employers [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=814.3199999999999s)]
*  and they're alarmed at the increase in healthcare costs [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=818.8399999999999s)]
*  every year. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  So this is a universal crisis, but you know what, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=825.92s)]
*  Peter, from my days in the media world, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=833.3199999999999s)]
*  I have learned that we're not going to change hearts [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=838.0s)]
*  and minds through numbers. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=840.8399999999999s)]
*  We need to tell stories. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=843.2s)]
*  And there is a story which actually the New York Times [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=846.0s)]
*  covered in Austin, Texas, which has become [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=849.24s)]
*  the amputation capital for people with diabetes. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=855.04s)]
*  Last year, there were 150,000 people with diabetes [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=860.6s)]
*  who had their legs or toes amputated. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=865.96s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=869.48s)]
*  That's an alarming number. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=871.08s)]
*  It's alarming, it's barbaric. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=873.08s)]
*  And also, not to mention the incredible cost in dollars, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=875.5600000000001s)]
*  these operations, prosthetics, infections, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=885.4s)]
*  the cost in human lives. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=889.0s)]
*  And human hope and human wellbeing and belief [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=891.88s)]
*  that life is a better tomorrow. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=897.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you've had part of your body cut off, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=899.52s)]
*  it's gotta be soul crushing. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=902.0s)]
*  Exactly everything you've said about optimism [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=905.12s)]
*  and how optimism helps us be healthier. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=907.88s)]
*  But the story in the New York Times was the story [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=911.16s)]
*  of one man, Robert Perez, 39-year-old record producer, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=914.04s)]
*  not an old man. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=919.28s)]
*  39, yeah. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=921.56s)]
*  And he was shown in a picture being fitted [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=923.44s)]
*  with a prosthetic. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=925.96s)]
*  And he said, and he was diagnosed with diabetes [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=928.04s)]
*  four years earlier. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  And he said he could never believe [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=932.36s)]
*  that it would get to this point. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  So how come that people don't know what's available to them, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=935.6s)]
*  not just in terms of medication, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=941.0799999999999s)]
*  but in terms of behaviors, in terms of what they eat, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=944.28s)]
*  their stress levels, their sleep, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=948.7199999999999s)]
*  and how all that impacts the progression of the disease. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=951.12s)]
*  And the sad thing is it's infinitely preventable. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=955.88s)]
*  And or reversible. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=961.92s)]
*  Yes, or manageable. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=964.64s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=967.0799999999999s)]
*  As you know, Thrive works on these five behaviors, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=968.8399999999999s)]
*  sleep, food. Please. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=972.1999999999999s)]
*  Actually, let's take a second [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=974.28s)]
*  and give the overview of Thrive Global, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=976.48s)]
*  because I think it's important for context [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=980.36s)]
*  for the rest of our hour here. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=982.36s)]
*  So when did you start Thrive Global? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=984.1999999999999s)]
*  And what does it do? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=987.3199999999999s)]
*  I started Thrive in 2016. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=989.16s)]
*  And the reason I did is because I wanted to go beyond [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=994.2s)]
*  just raising awareness, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=998.72s)]
*  which I could have continued doing [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1000.88s)]
*  through a media company at the Huffington Post. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1002.76s)]
*  I wanted to- [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1005.92s)]
*  That you had sold Huffington Post to AOL? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1006.76s)]
*  But I sold it in 2011. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1008.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1011.32s)]
*  And I continued running it. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1012.16s)]
*  And my intention was to continue running it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1013.76s)]
*  But after I started covering these issues exhaustively [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1017.2s)]
*  on the Huffington Post, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1022.36s)]
*  writing two books on the subject, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1023.6s)]
*  Thrive and the Sleep Revolution, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1025.68s)]
*  I wanted to do something more. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1028.88s)]
*  I wanted to help people change behaviors. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1030.92s)]
*  I didn't just want them to know [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1034.32s)]
*  that they need to get a good night's sleep [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1036.44s)]
*  or not eat a lot of sugar and ultra processed foods. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1038.72s)]
*  I wanted to help them do that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1042.1200000000001s)]
*  And I couldn't do that through a media company. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1045.32s)]
*  I had to build a behavior change technology company. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1048.04s)]
*  And that's why I left the Huffington Post in 2016 [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1053.48s)]
*  to launch Thrive. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1058.4399999999998s)]
*  And frankly, I'm grateful to my mom, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1060.6799999999998s)]
*  my amazing Greek mom, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1063.2s)]
*  who had taught me- [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1065.76s)]
*  What was her name? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1067.6799999999998s)]
*  Her name was Ellie. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1070.48s)]
*  She had taught me not to be afraid of failing. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  And that's something for all entrepreneurs here. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1075.32s)]
*  When you leave a very successful media company [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1078.72s)]
*  in 18 countries with a pool, it's- [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1081.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was amazing. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  And a great newsroom. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1086.6799999999998s)]
*  To start again, there are no guarantees of success. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1090.6799999999998s)]
*  My mother used to say, don't be afraid of failure. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1094.84s)]
*  Failure is not the opposite of success. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1098.04s)]
*  It's a stepping stone to success. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1100.64s)]
*  Smart woman. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1103.44s)]
*  So, I literally left the Huffington Post. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1104.52s)]
*  Sophia. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1106.84s)]
*  Sophia started again, raising money, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1107.96s)]
*  hiring people, et cetera. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1112.04s)]
*  And the goal was to be a B2B company [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1113.96s)]
*  where we could go into enterprises [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1118.08s)]
*  and help them reduce stress and burnout [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1121.32s)]
*  and make the connection [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1125.0s)]
*  between improving wellbeing and health, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1127.08s)]
*  reducing stress and burnout, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1129.6s)]
*  and improving business metrics. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1131.4399999999998s)]
*  Kind of elevating these issues [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1134.12s)]
*  from the warm and fuzzy, nice to have, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1137.1999999999998s)]
*  to kind of business imperatives. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1141.1999999999998s)]
*  We call them productivity multipliers. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1143.52s)]
*  I love that reframing. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1146.8s)]
*  Because what CEO wouldn't want to maintain [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1150.1999999999998s)]
*  productivity multipliers, even when you're cutting budgets? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1155.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1158.8s)]
*  Otherwise, it becomes the first thing to be cut [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1159.6399999999999s)]
*  in tough times and uncertain times, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1164.52s)]
*  which is what we have all the time now. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1167.0s)]
*  So, we were very lucky. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1171.24s)]
*  We brought in some great partners, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1175.76s)]
*  Accenture, Salesforce, Walmart, AT&T, et cetera, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1180.44s)]
*  and started seeing the results. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1186.2s)]
*  And the results that got me to move more and more [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1189.3600000000001s)]
*  towards health are the results at Walmart. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1193.8s)]
*  Because we're in our sixth year there, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1197.64s)]
*  working with many of their associates, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1200.3200000000002s)]
*  as they call their employees, who are minimum wage, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1203.16s)]
*  who through these five behaviors that we work on, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1207.52s)]
*  sleep, food, exercise, stress management, and connection, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1212.1599999999999s)]
*  started having real health results, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1220.12s)]
*  reversing hypertension, reversing diabetes, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1224.04s)]
*  without obviously any medical interventions. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1227.8s)]
*  This is all digital, what you call these micro steps. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1232.8s)]
*  Micro steps, yes. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1237.8799999999999s)]
*  Our behavior change methodology, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1239.56s)]
*  we have a great scientific board, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1242.44s)]
*  BJ Fogg from Stanford is the chairman, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1244.36s)]
*  great behavior change economists like Kevin Volpe [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1247.8799999999999s)]
*  and David Arsh from Penn. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1251.24s)]
*  Everything is broken down into micro steps, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1254.0s)]
*  tiny, daily, incremental steps that become healthier habits. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1257.04s)]
*  And you have a great quote by Aristotle in your book [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1263.1599999999999s)]
*  that basically our habits are who we are, here it is. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1268.28s)]
*  We are what we repeatedly do. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1274.2s)]
*  Excellence then is not an act, but a habit. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1277.24s)]
*  And one of my favorite quotes. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1281.0s)]
*  And so if we repeatedly do small incremental things [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1284.56s)]
*  that are good for our health, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1290.28s)]
*  we are going to build cumulatively healthier habits. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1292.72s)]
*  And I love this. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1296.68s)]
*  I think one of the things that's been a great insight for me [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1298.0s)]
*  and I wrote about this, I added a chapter [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1302.44s)]
*  to my upcoming book, Longevity Guidebook on routines, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1306.16s)]
*  because I realized that it was the single most important [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1310.92s)]
*  thing I was doing was learning these routines, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1314.5600000000002s)]
*  learning these habits. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1318.24s)]
*  And a great habit is something you do [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1320.2s)]
*  so you don't negotiate with yourself. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1322.76s)]
*  It's just something you're gonna do. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1324.92s)]
*  So if you're warm and cozy under the covers in the morning [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1326.76s)]
*  and the alarm goes off [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1334.0s)]
*  because you've scheduled yourself to go work out, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1335.68s)]

*  You'll find it at viome.com slash Peter. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1480.24s)]
*  You know, Ariana, those five elements [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1484.16s)]
*  are so critically important. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1487.2s)]
*  And I do wanna hit just a couple of points on the numbers. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1489.76s)]
*  And you're right, it is. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1494.0s)]
*  We learn in story. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1495.8000000000002s)]
*  And for any entrepreneur, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1497.64s)]
*  it's like giving numbers is one thing. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1499.5600000000002s)]
*  Telling great stories is 100 times more powerful, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1501.44s)]
*  which is why Ariana's such a great entrepreneur. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1504.68s)]
*  But I am gonna hit a few numbers here. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1507.2s)]
*  And the thing that is so scary [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1509.5200000000002s)]
*  is the healthcare obesity epidemic, right? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  We're at 41.8% obesity in the US and rising. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1515.0s)]
*  And it's causing diabetes and heart disease and cancer. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1521.76s)]
*  And there are multiple causes, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1526.12s)]
*  but small changes, small micro steps as you teach [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1529.6799999999998s)]
*  can change that. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1534.76s)]
*  And the other element here is, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1538.36s)]
*  you know, the numbers that I pulled [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1543.1999999999998s)]
*  were like 400,000 deaths per year are preventable [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1545.2399999999998s)]
*  because of diet or tobacco. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1549.9599999999998s)]
*  You know, I haven't seen a, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1552.96s)]
*  I haven't seen a tobacco carton in a long time. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1555.44s)]
*  And I saw one in the trash the other day. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1559.88s)]
*  And I don't know how, how can they be more explicit? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1562.56s)]
*  It says, this package will kill you. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like skull and crossbones. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1568.0800000000002s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1573.52s)]
*  But you know, what we are finding [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1574.3600000000001s)]
*  is that people are more likely to change behaviors [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1576.8s)]
*  if you focus on what they're looking forward to. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1581.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1584.56s)]
*  Like on the fact that they want to take [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1585.52s)]
*  their grandchild to the park [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1588.32s)]
*  or celebrate their daughter's wedding [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1591.0s)]
*  or be able to still go on a hike as they age. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1594.6s)]
*  These are much more likely to get them [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1599.52s)]
*  to do what's good for their health [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1602.6399999999999s)]
*  than if you tell them you're going to die. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1604.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1607.24s)]
*  And that's why behavior change methodology [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1608.08s)]
*  is so important. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1610.28s)]
*  And Peter, we have been doing it wrong for so many years. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1611.24s)]
*  You know, first of all, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1615.76s)]
*  we've been focusing on new year resolutions, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1616.6s)]
*  which tend to be abandoned within two to three weeks [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1620.3999999999999s)]
*  in general because they're so big. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1625.16s)]
*  You know, they're like, I'm going to go to the gym [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1627.6399999999999s)]
*  first thing in the morning for an hour every day, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1630.08s)]
*  or I'm going to completely give up sugar. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1633.56s)]
*  I know you and I have completely given up sugar, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1635.8799999999999s)]
*  but it was gradual for me. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1639.12s)]
*  I didn't wake up one day and did it. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1641.7199999999998s)]
*  And now it's like effortless. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1644.76s)]
*  I have- [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1647.56s)]
*  It is effortless. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  And for me, it was doing it in a group setting, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1649.2399999999998s)]
*  going through it with a community, right? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1652.08s)]
*  Which is supportive. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1655.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1658.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to find your, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1658.84s)]
*  we call them accountability buddies. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1660.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1662.7199999999998s)]
*  People who will support you. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1663.6399999999999s)]
*  And then you begin to feel better. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1665.9199999999998s)]
*  And it becomes easier and easier [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1669.84s)]
*  until there's no more self-negotiation. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1671.64s)]
*  It's like you don't have the dessert [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1674.72s)]
*  put down in front of you, period. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1678.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's my hack. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1681.28s)]
*  It just, I don't want to see it. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1682.84s)]
*  I don't want to be negotiating with myself. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1684.4s)]
*  I don't want to be tempted. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1686.6s)]
*  Just know. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1688.12s)]
*  Also, you have to know yourself. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1688.96s)]
*  I have an addictive personality. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1690.36s)]
*  Like there are people who can say, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1693.28s)]
*  I'm just going to have a bite of this dessert. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1695.24s)]
*  I'm not, I'm just going to have a bite person. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1697.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1700.3200000000002s)]
*  I feel like I'm not going to have any, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1701.16s)]
*  or I'm going to have the whole thing. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1702.6000000000001s)]
*  The other thing is that I found that [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1705.6000000000001s)]
*  what has changed all my habits around exercise [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1709.0s)]
*  was what we call a thrive habit stacking. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1712.68s)]
*  You add a habit you enjoy, or you do regularly [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1716.64s)]
*  on top of another habit, which you, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1721.64s)]
*  it's harder for you. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1725.8400000000001s)]
*  So I have added watching my favorite shows [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1727.72s)]
*  only when I'm on my treadmill or on my bike. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1732.2s)]
*  Love it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1736.3600000000001s)]
*  And it's been amazing. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1737.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, when I wanted to see the end of Succession [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1738.6000000000001s)]
*  or recently, what was the, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1743.72s)]
*  Mama's on and Apple show. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1749.0s)]
*  I literally was on my treadmill for two and a half hours. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1753.48s)]
*  I didn't want to stop. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1757.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1759.44s)]
*  What is it that you knew that's going to [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1762.28s)]
*  end the self negotiation? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1765.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1769.8s)]
*  You know, for me, I do my board calls. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1770.96s)]
*  If I'm not presenting on my, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1773.96s)]
*  it's right over here, my Techno Gym bike, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1776.8s)]
*  just because I think of sitting as the new smoking. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1779.64s)]
*  And we spend so much time sitting down. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1782.6799999999998s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1784.72s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1786.12s)]
*  So exactly, you found your own way to combine [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1786.96s)]
*  something with something else. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1790.4399999999998s)]
*  Talk to me more about a user coming onto Thrive, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1793.36s)]
*  onto the Thrive platform. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1798.48s)]
*  So, I mean, I think I want to understand where it is today [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1800.28s)]
*  and where you're going with it and how it collects the data [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1804.76s)]
*  so that, you know, we can get people a vision [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1810.28s)]
*  of the future here. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1813.2s)]
*  Great. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1814.8799999999999s)]
*  So, to give you the vision of the future, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1815.8s)]
*  I need to also tell you that we launched a new company, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1820.68s)]
*  which is funded jointly by Thrive Global and OpenAI [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1823.76s)]
*  with two strategic investors, Eli Lilly [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1833.0s)]
*  and the Alice Walton Foundation. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1837.4s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1840.4s)]
*  And the purpose of this company is to just create [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1841.24s)]
*  an AI health coach. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1847.44s)]
*  And that's called Thrive AI Health? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1849.48s)]
*  Thrive AI Health, yes. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1851.88s)]
*  So, the original company, Thrive Global, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1854.24s)]
*  is focused on meeting people where they are at work. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1860.2s)]
*  Like, if you spend a lot of your day on Microsoft Teams, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1864.72s)]
*  Thrive will meet you on Microsoft Teams. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1871.48s)]
*  If you spend a lot of your day on Slack or Webex, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1874.0s)]
*  we meet you there. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1877.08s)]
*  By the way, you've got an important stat there, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1878.48s)]
*  which I'd love you to share, because I've heard this. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1880.84s)]
*  And it's, again, a really important entrepreneurial tip [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1883.84s)]
*  on meeting people where they are [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1888.04s)]
*  versus trying to get people to come to you. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1890.68s)]
*  Could you describe that? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1892.44s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1894.24s)]
*  Pfizer is one of the companies we work with. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1895.3999999999999s)]
*  The numbers on engagement, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1899.28s)]
*  you Thrive colleagues, as they call their employees, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1904.28s)]
*  engaging, Pfizer colleagues engaging with Thrive, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1907.76s)]
*  on the Thrive app is 14%. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1912.72s)]
*  14, okay. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1916.68s)]
*  Pfizer colleagues engaging with Thrive, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1917.52s)]
*  exactly the same content, the same micro steps [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1921.32s)]
*  on Microsoft Teams is 76%. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1924.48s)]
*  Because they're there already. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1928.48s)]
*  Because they're there, we come to you. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1929.96s)]
*  Yeah. We eliminate friction. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1932.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1935.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's such an important lesson [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1936.24s)]
*  for entrepreneurs to realize, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1937.96s)]
*  don't expect the users you want to always come to you. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1942.28s)]
*  Where are they hanging out? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1947.6399999999999s)]
*  What are a whole are they in already? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1949.0s)]
*  And how do you present yourself there? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1951.72s)]
*  An easy, you know, increment, small micro step, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1953.8s)]
*  as you say, to get to you. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1957.72s)]
*  Yes. And, but also at Thrive, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1960.72s)]
*  we have what we call a cultural activation. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1965.6s)]
*  So that we, when we start a partnership, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1969.52s)]
*  we have a fireside chat [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1975.24s)]
*  with the CHRO or even the CEO or a business leader [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1980.72s)]
*  that sets up what we're doing and why. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1986.88s)]
*  So that people at every level of the company [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1992.0s)]
*  have cultural permission to engage. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1995.32s)]
*  As you know, culture is changed at the top. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=1998.64s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2001.52s)]
*  And I mean, I have done so many amazing fireside chats [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2002.56s)]
*  with CEOs who talk about their micro steps, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2008.4s)]
*  what they are doing, how they learn, for example, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2012.08s)]
*  to put their phone away at night. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2016.28s)]
*  As you have, Peter, are you still doing it? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2018.96s)]
*  Remember the phone? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2022.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm like, my, one of the hacks I learned [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2023.6s)]
*  from Matt Walker, who wrote also an amazing book on sleep, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2027.8s)]
*  is I will only look at my phone while I'm standing up [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2031.8s)]
*  before going to sleep. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2036.32s)]
*  And then when I lie down, the phone goes away. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2038.12s)]
*  And I get very tired at night sitting there, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2042.24s)]
*  like last few texts or emails, and then it's gone. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2045.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2050.2s)]
*  You know, this is the most important sleep micro step. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2051.04s)]
*  I do remember you built these little beds [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2054.4s)]
*  for our phones to charge. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2057.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2059.08s)]
*  This is the only physical product we have produced at Thrive [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2059.92s)]
*  is the little phone beds that we sell at cost on Amazon [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2064.2799999999997s)]
*  in mahogany and light wood. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2068.3199999999997s)]
*  Love it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2070.48s)]
*  And the idea is to live outside everybody's bedrooms [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2071.3199999999997s)]
*  and be the place where everybody's phones go. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2075.4s)]
*  Yours, your wife's, your twins, your twin bodies. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2079.16s)]
*  The twins don't have phones yet. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2082.6s)]
*  They're not gonna have phones till they're 16. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2083.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2085.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm drawing the line. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2086.64s)]
*  But once, I'm going to send you the new version, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2087.48s)]
*  the new improved version of the phone bed. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2093.48s)]
*  So when the twins get the phone, they learn phone hygiene. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2096.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2100.36s)]
*  From day one. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2101.2s)]
*  Your phone doesn't sleep with you. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2102.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2104.44s)]
*  Because that is an issue for a lot of teens right now. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2105.28s)]
*  You know, they bring their phone to bed [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2109.12s)]
*  and they're under the covers on social media, you know, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2111.44s)]
*  which will steal two hours of sleep. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2115.7599999999998s)]
*  And people need to realize you get your deep sleep [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2118.48s)]
*  at the beginning of your sleep cycle, right? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2121.8799999999997s)]
*  Which is so critically important. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2125.48s)]
*  If you wake up too early, you're gonna eliminate some REM, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2127.2799999999997s)]
*  but you'll have gotten your deep sleep already. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2131.3999999999996s)]
*  But that's why you see by having this cultural activation, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2133.8799999999997s)]
*  these fireside chats, these webinars, leadership journeys [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2137.8399999999997s)]
*  who have over 50 facilitators, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2142.3999999999996s)]
*  by having all that in an ongoing way, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2146.0s)]
*  we actually create a culture where the platform [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2150.52s)]
*  and the digital products can be embedded. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2156.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2159.48s)]
*  And accepted. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2160.32s)]
*  And accepted and practiced. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2161.1600000000003s)]
*  And then we collect stories from the CEO down, you know, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2163.2000000000003s)]
*  how are you doing it? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2168.28s)]
*  What micro steps are you using? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2169.56s)]
*  Which inspire others to join. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2172.12s)]
*  You know, one of the things that you did as part of this [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2176.4s)]
*  is your reset program. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2181.52s)]
*  Yes. Right? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2184.3199999999997s)]
*  Which I found fascinating. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2185.6s)]
*  Can you explain what that is? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2189.48s)]
*  And I think we have teed up a 60 second Ariana reset. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2191.2s)]
*  So it's actually kind of one of my absolute favorite features [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2196.2799999999997s)]
*  at Thrive because in 60 seconds, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2201.84s)]
*  you can have such an impact. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2205.32s)]
*  It's based on the neuroscience as you know, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2207.32s)]
*  that while stress is unavoidable, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2210.48s)]
*  there is nobody who has a stress free existence, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2213.5600000000004s)]
*  cumulative stress is avoidable. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2216.96s)]
*  And it takes 60 to 90 seconds to move from the sympathetic [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2219.88s)]
*  to the parasympathetic nervous system [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2224.6800000000003s)]
*  away from the fight or flight response. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2227.36s)]
*  Yes, to the rest and digest. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2230.44s)]
*  Yes. Exactly. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2231.92s)]
*  So whether you are on Teams or Webex or Slack [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2233.16s)]
*  or on the Thrive app, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2237.36s)]
*  you have access to hundreds of Thrive resets [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2239.04s)]
*  that have a breathing bubble [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2243.8s)]
*  so that you can breathe consciously. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2245.84s)]
*  Because as you know, our breath is our superpower. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2247.68s)]
*  Music, images, quotes, and you can pick what you like. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2251.52s)]
*  One of my favorite illustrations of the power of resets [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2257.04s)]
*  is we've brought them into dozens of contact centers [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2262.4s)]
*  around the world. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2267.72s)]
*  And you know, contact center agents [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2268.92s)]
*  are among the most stressed populations. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2270.96s)]
*  And because time is so precious, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2274.36s)]
*  we only give them three resets a day. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2278.48s)]
*  The employer decides what the triggers are. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2283.32s)]
*  The results have been amazing. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2287.84s)]
*  The results in productivity, in customer success. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2289.96s)]
*  But my favorite data point is Synchrony, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2293.84s)]
*  the financial company did a survey and asked their agents, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2298.36s)]
*  do you prefer continuing to get three Thrive resets a day [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2302.88s)]
*  or get three five minute breaks? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2307.1600000000003s)]
*  So 15 versus three minutes. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2310.3199999999997s)]
*  And 76% said, we'd rather get the resets. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2313.24s)]
*  Because if we get the five minutes, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2318.24s)]
*  they talked about what are they going to do? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2320.72s)]
*  They're going to go doom scroll the news [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2322.7599999999998s)]
*  or go on Instagram and get more stressed out [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2325.96s)]
*  comparing their lives to somebody else's life. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2329.3599999999997s)]
*  And this is like a 60 second resets [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2332.8399999999997s)]
*  a 60 second reset. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2338.32s)]
*  It's a fuel for your soul. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2342.6800000000003s)]
*  Fuel for your soul, exactly. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2345.1600000000003s)]
*  And we've now created a system where you can go on Thrive [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2347.0s)]
*  and build your own personal reset [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2353.32s)]
*  with things that give you joy [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2355.6000000000004s)]
*  and remind you of what you're grateful for in your life. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2357.32s)]
*  And I love that. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2361.36s)]
*  And I built my own 60 second reset [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2363.0s)]
*  and we made a partnership with Universal Music [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2368.6400000000003s)]
*  so that you can take 60 second of Universal Music songs [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2371.76s)]
*  and you can update them. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2376.88s)]
*  Mine was recently updated [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2379.32s)]
*  with a picture of my grandson, Alexander. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2381.1200000000003s)]
*  Congratulations, yeah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2384.5600000000004s)]
*  Thank you, yeah, yeah, exactly. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2386.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, Huffington when he started. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2387.88s)]
*  Well, why don't we take a look at your reset video [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2392.6800000000003s)]
*  so people can see what this is [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2394.8s)]
*  and how the power with imagery and music [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2396.8s)]
*  to calm your soul and to put you [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2402.0s)]
*  into that parasympathetic mode. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2404.32s)]
*  We've talked about this before of just taking a few deep [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2406.36s)]
*  breaths and in particular before eating your lunch or dinner [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2410.8s)]
*  so you can put yourself into a rest and digest situation [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2415.44s)]
*  instead of a fight or flight, which is the wrong place. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2419.1600000000003s)]
*  First of all, to be making decisions from [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2422.04s)]
*  and secondly, to be consuming your nutrients. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2424.04s)]
*  If we could, let's play Ariana's reset. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2427.76s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2492.76s)]
*  It worked for me as well, which is amazing. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2497.76s)]
*  Would you like to see mine? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2501.76s)]
*  Yes, oh my God, I'm so happy you made one. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2503.28s)]
*  I could not not make one. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2506.76s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2508.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's an early draft, but I think this shares [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2510.28s)]
*  a little bit about who you are in an intimate form. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2516.6800000000003s)]
*  In an intimate fashion. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2521.7999999999997s)]
*  So let me share a little bit about who I am. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2523.96s)]
*  All right, let's roll my reset. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2527.16s)]
*  ["Restarting My Life"] [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2529.96s)]
*  ["Restarting My Life"] [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2551.68s)]
*  ["Restarting My Life"] [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2581.68s)]
*  Wow, this is amazing. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2601.68s)]
*  I absolutely love it. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2604.3599999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2606.96s)]
*  Seeing your twins and your parents and your wife [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2607.8s)]
*  and favorite quotes, I mean, it has an impact on me. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2612.8s)]
*  Yeah, I was so excited about it when I saw yours [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2618.04s)]
*  and I was like, there's so many times during the day [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2623.7200000000003s)]
*  that I'm stressed because I'm just, I'm running nonstop. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2627.88s)]
*  And again, many entrepreneurs are in the same mode [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2632.7200000000003s)]
*  where it's like back to back to back to back to back. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2637.16s)]
*  Who creates this crazy schedule? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2640.56s)]
*  Who can I blame yourself? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2642.64s)]
*  Having just the ability to know that you're stressed [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2645.3599999999997s)]
*  and to play that. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2651.0s)]
*  Everybody, I wanna take a short break from our episode [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2652.04s)]
*  to talk about a company that's very important to me [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2653.96s)]
*  and could actually save your life [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2657.04s)]
*  or the life of someone that you love. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2659.24s)]
*  Company is called Fountain Life. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2660.8799999999997s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2662.92s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2666.08s)]
*  Most of us don't actually know [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2669.04s)]
*  what's going on inside our body. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2670.64s)]
*  We're all optimists until that day [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2672.88s)]
*  when you have a pain in your side, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2675.64s)]
*  you go to the physician in the emergency room and they say, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2677.36s)]
*  listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2679.64s)]
*  but you have this stage three or four going on. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2681.06s)]
*  And it didn't start that morning. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2684.2799999999997s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2687.24s)]
*  but because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2690.68s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2694.28s)]
*  was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2696.6400000000003s)]
*  We have four across the US today [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2699.78s)]
*  and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2702.1200000000003s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2704.4s)]
*  a brain, a brain vasculature, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2707.32s)]
*  an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2709.36s)]
*  DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2712.48s)]
*  a full executive blood workup. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2715.8s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2717.92s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2721.36s)]
*  and our physicians to find any disease [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2724.96s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2728.2000000000003s)]
*  You're gonna find out eventually. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2731.2000000000003s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2733.08s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2735.32s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2738.36s)]

*  as one of my listeners. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2789.6400000000003s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2790.76s)]
*  I wanna get a little bit now, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2792.48s)]
*  well, I'll say one other thing, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2795.88s)]
*  which is these are intimate and they share [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2797.2200000000003s)]
*  what is the most meaningful part of your life, right? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2803.04s)]
*  So every night when I go to sleep, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2805.88s)]
*  I will do my best to focus in on [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2810.98s)]
*  what I'm most grateful for, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2815.0s)]
*  the three things I'm most grateful for the day, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2817.88s)]
*  from the day. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2820.8s)]
*  And typically it's 90% the things [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2822.2200000000003s)]
*  that an entrepreneur doesn't think about. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2827.56s)]
*  It's your kids, it's your friends, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2828.84s)]
*  it's the hugs and all of that. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2831.08s)]
*  And so that realization is really sort of amplified in this [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2835.88s)]
*  and so it can ground you once again, very quickly. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2842.12s)]
*  And also again, it's based on the science [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2846.44s)]
*  that gratitude is an antidote to stress and anxiety. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2849.48s)]
*  So stress and anxiety are part of life, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2859.4s)]
*  but when we remember what we're grateful for, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2862.46s)]
*  that's more powerful. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2867.06s)]
*  And the other thing we do is we start team meetings [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2869.46s)]
*  with spinning a wheel and one of us plays the reset. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2873.3s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2879.42s)]
*  So you get a little bit of an insight into everybody's lives. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2880.26s)]
*  Yes, you get a little glimpse. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2885.82s)]
*  I'll wanna do that for my team meetings for sure. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2889.3s)]
*  I think what I really want is my AI [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2895.42s)]
*  to be measuring my cortisol levels and my heart rate [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2898.78s)]
*  and the tenor of my voice and to say, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2904.02s)]
*  Peter, excuse me a second, watch this video. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2908.0600000000004s)]
*  Yes, well that's what the coach, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2911.5800000000004s)]
*  that's what we're training the coach to do. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2914.7000000000003s)]
*  So the AI, the Thrive AI coach is trained [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2917.9s)]
*  on only on peer reviewed literature, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2921.5400000000004s)]
*  not on the whole of the web. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2924.86s)]
*  On our behavior change. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2928.7000000000003s)]
*  That's a good thing, not on the whole of the web. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2930.6200000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of shocking recommendations out there. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2933.1800000000003s)]
*  Our behavior change methodology, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2937.6200000000003s)]
*  our thousands of micro steps, videos, articles, resets, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2939.94s)]
*  and also the very, very thorough onboarding. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2945.78s)]
*  So when we onboard you, we'll get all your biometric data, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2954.62s)]
*  lab data, medical data, but also all your preferences. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2958.46s)]
*  The foods you like to eat, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2963.06s)]
*  the time you like to go to sleep, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2967.5s)]
*  the exercise you like, everything. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2969.86s)]
*  So that our recommendations and nudges and micro steps [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2973.14s)]
*  are going to be hyper personalized. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2978.94s)]
*  I think that's really the superpower of AI. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2980.66s)]
*  The level of hyper personalization would not be possible [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2984.62s)]
*  without the context window of AI, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2988.8599999999997s)]
*  billions and potentially trillions of data points. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2991.8599999999997s)]
*  And the multimodal version, right? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2995.62s)]
*  We're all gonna have, so I speak about this a lot, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=2997.3399999999997s)]
*  the notion that we're all gonna have some version [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3000.54s)]
*  of Jarvis from Iron Man. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3002.66s)]
*  Call it a co-pilot, call it your coach [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3003.9s)]
*  that knows everything about you. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3006.58s)]
*  You're gonna give it permission to know anything [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3009.58s)]
*  and everything about you so that it can maximize [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3012.3s)]
*  its support of you, right? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3016.02s)]
*  It's measuring your sleep. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3017.78s)]
*  You'll give it permission to listen to your conversations, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3020.22s)]
*  to read your emails. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3022.66s)]
*  And at least I believe there's gonna be a future [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3025.7s)]
*  where it heard my conversation with somebody, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3028.74s)]
*  I walk into the room, it knows I'm stressed, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3033.1800000000003s)]
*  the music changes, my reset video comes up on the screen [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3035.78s)]
*  and I'm psychologically reset. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3041.78s)]
*  At the same time, my AI is measuring my blood sugar, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3046.6200000000003s)]
*  my vitamin levels, my mRNAs, whatever, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3050.38s)]
*  and it's telling the robot in the kitchen [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3053.54s)]
*  what meal to prepare needed for my blood markers [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3056.46s)]
*  at this moment. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3061.46s)]
*  And I love the fact that there is so much [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3062.58s)]
*  that's possible right now and then there are things [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3067.1s)]
*  that are going to be possible maybe sooner than we think, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3071.42s)]
*  like a robot in the kitchen preparing our meal. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3075.02s)]
*  But I think it's important to know how much [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3077.98s)]
*  is available right now because people are hurting. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3080.14s)]
*  Yeah, and I love the fact that you've really come, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3085.94s)]
*  I mean, you and I have approached this [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3088.86s)]
*  from two different ends of the spectrum, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3090.46s)]
*  but Thrive Global and Thrive AI has really made this possible [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3092.7400000000002s)]
*  on a de minimis cost, right? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3099.7400000000002s)]
*  And I think the fact of the matter is this is a price [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3102.7s)]
*  that an employer is willing gratefully to pay [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3109.3s)]
*  because of increased productivity and less days missed [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3114.2200000000003s)]
*  and reduced healthcare costs, and it's a win-win-win. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3119.8599999999997s)]
*  And I'm sure the numbers are pretty dramatic. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3124.54s)]
*  I quoted you in the book about some of the numbers. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3127.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you have them there accessible? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3131.66s)]
*  Well, the numbers are dramatic, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3133.8199999999997s)]
*  and thank you for quoting them in the book, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3135.8599999999997s)]
*  both in terms of productivity, absenteeism, recruitment, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3138.3399999999997s)]
*  all the metrics that matter to an employer, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3144.3399999999997s)]
*  but also, Peter, what we are doing now, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3148.86s)]
*  and that's kind of the additional new part for Thrive, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3152.54s)]
*  is working through big companies like Eli Lilly. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3156.6200000000003s)]
*  So neither Thrive Global nor Thrive AI Health [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3163.1000000000004s)]
*  are going to be a consumer product. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3168.3s)]
*  At some point, maybe Thrive AI Health [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3171.06s)]
*  will launch a consumer product, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3173.5800000000004s)]
*  but right now, the model is B2B and B2B2C. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3175.3s)]
*  And just to give you an example of the B2B2C, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3181.7000000000003s)]
*  Eli Lilly wants to go directly to consumers. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3187.1400000000003s)]
*  They want to have a direct relationship with consumers, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3192.0600000000004s)]
*  so they launched Lilly Direct. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3195.7400000000002s)]
*  Thrive is already a partner. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3199.1800000000003s)]
*  So you go to Lilly Direct, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3202.1400000000003s)]
*  you have a telehealth appointment, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3203.9s)]
*  you get your obesity, diabetes, migraine, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3205.7000000000003s)]
*  soon Alzheimer's drug, whatever you drug your own, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3210.1s)]
*  and then you are given the coach for free. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3213.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3217.42s)]
*  Now, as you know, as an amazing entrepreneur, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3218.26s)]
*  incentives are superpowers. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3221.38s)]
*  They are, I built a whole XPRIZE around that. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3223.6600000000003s)]
*  Exactly, so we need to understand [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3227.46s)]
*  why would a pharma company give you a coach for free [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3230.02s)]
*  to improve your daily behaviors [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3235.34s)]
*  while you are taking your drug? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3238.18s)]
*  And the reasons are so clear. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3241.02s)]
*  One of the biggest problems pharma companies have [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3243.62s)]
*  exactly is adherence. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3247.22s)]
*  25% of people do not even fill the first prescription. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3249.82s)]
*  Now, if they have a coach [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3255.22s)]
*  that is involved in their daily behaviors [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3257.54s)]
*  and their relationship is not just transactional, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3261.74s)]
*  but much deeper and more intimate, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3266.34s)]
*  you are improving adherence categorically. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3268.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3272.42s)]
*  And also another thing is pharma companies, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3273.3s)]
*  PBMs, payers, providers, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3277.46s)]
*  are dealing with a reputation problem at the moment. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3280.1s)]
*  Yes, they are, for sure. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3284.06s)]
*  Building a relationship, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3286.62s)]
*  it's not just transactional, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3290.46s)]
*  it's a huge reputation hello. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3294.2599999999998s)]
*  So we are just always looking at what are [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3296.2999999999997s)]
*  the incentives here so that we can scale. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3302.2999999999997s)]
*  And the goal of the coach is to democratize access [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3306.02s)]
*  to what the people you and I know [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3309.62s)]
*  and you work with are already doing. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3313.78s)]
*  People with resources are already optimizing [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3315.98s)]
*  for these five behaviors. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3318.98s)]
*  It, well, the more wise you get [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3321.2200000000003s)]
*  and the more you, the older you get, bluntly, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3326.02s)]
*  the more you realize that these things are fundamental. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3330.26s)]
*  I love life, I wanna see as much of it as I can [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3336.02s)]
*  and it's not gonna happen without optimization. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3338.94s)]
*  And the things that you can do today are sleep, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3344.02s)]
*  diet, exercise, mindset, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3348.7000000000003s)]
*  those are literally free and low cost things [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3351.54s)]
*  that you can alter. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3355.38s)]
*  But people don't because it's easy [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3357.1400000000003s)]
*  to continue doing what you've always done. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3362.1400000000003s)]
*  And also because the majority of people don't have access [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3364.54s)]
*  to that expert level coaching [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3370.38s)]
*  that so many people with resources do have access to. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3374.38s)]
*  So that's really the reason why Alice Walton invested [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3379.38s)]
*  in the company is because her whole goal [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3382.54s)]
*  is to bring the power of AI to the heartland, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3384.82s)]
*  to basically democratize and scale everything [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3390.3s)]
*  that we know scientifically that AI makes possible. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3394.5s)]
*  And that's really what I'm so excited about. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3399.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, health inequities for me are the biggest inequity. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3402.02s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3408.3s)]
*  You know, you and I are gonna be on stage together [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3410.2200000000003s)]
*  at the Abundance Summit in March [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3412.82s)]
*  and going into depth on this and excited to see you personally [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3416.14s)]
*  and give you a big hug, hopefully before then, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3421.94s)]
*  but at least in March. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3424.54s)]
*  You too. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3426.38s)]
*  You know, I'm gonna have the team from Felmton Life [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3427.3799999999997s)]
*  that will be there, which has been my diagnostics [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3431.14s)]
*  and therapeutics center. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3434.54s)]
*  You know, we're taking a different part of the sector [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3436.22s)]
*  where we're really gathering 200 gigabytes of data [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3441.4599999999996s)]
*  about your current state of physiology, right? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3446.4599999999996s)]
*  It's full body MRI, brain, brain vasculature, coronary CT, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3450.02s)]
*  DEXA scan, lung scan, microbiome, metabolome, all of that. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3453.66s)]
*  And then through a functional medicine lens, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3460.42s)]
*  answering the two questions, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3463.7s)]
*  is there anything going on inside your body [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3465.8199999999997s)]
*  you need to know about right now? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3468.22s)]
*  Because sadly, we're all optimists about our health [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3469.5s)]
*  and we actually have very little idea [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3474.46s)]
*  of what's going on inside our body unless you look. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3476.8199999999997s)]
*  And then what's likely to happen to you down the line [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3479.66s)]
*  and how do we prevent that from happening [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3484.1400000000003s)]
*  and optimize you in that way. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3486.26s)]
*  But what you're doing is so important [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3488.9s)]
*  as the upfront portion of that at scale. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3494.06s)]
*  And so I'm super thankful. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3498.26s)]
*  And I really wanna see if we can deliver Thrive Global [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3502.1s)]
*  to all of our members there. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3506.54s)]
*  Can I ask you, you got Sam Altman involved [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3509.86s)]
*  as a co-founder of Thrive AI. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3512.86s)]
*  How did that materialize? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3516.54s)]
*  I know that Sam is interested in longevity. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3518.46s)]
*  I've had those conversations. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3523.2200000000003s)]
*  I've had him on the abundance stage as well. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3524.46s)]
*  And I know he had partnered with Joe Betts-Lecroi [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3527.1s)]
*  to create retro biosciences, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3532.54s)]
*  looking at epigenetic reprogramming. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3536.02s)]
*  Was this something that he approached you on [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3539.1800000000003s)]
*  or did you approach him on? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3541.34s)]
*  How did it materialize? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3543.5s)]
*  We got to know each other. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3544.98s)]
*  We met at a conference three years ago. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3546.54s)]
*  And during the time we spent together, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3550.18s)]
*  we found an alignment around behaviors. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3556.8199999999997s)]
*  For him, for two reasons. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3562.7s)]
*  One is that personally, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3564.18s)]
*  he talks about how he was dealing with crippling anxiety [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3566.62s)]
*  and how he started prioritizing his sleep, his meditation. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3571.1s)]
*  You know, he's a meditator, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3575.38s)]
*  he's been to retreats, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3577.98s)]
*  to just actually connect with a deeper part of himself, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3582.1s)]
*  food, exercise, all these things that we're talking about. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3585.8199999999997s)]
*  How he brought them to his life [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3589.14s)]
*  and how it changed outcomes [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3592.14s)]
*  and made him infinitely more productive. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3595.62s)]
*  And also able to be in the eye of the hurricane, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3598.66s)]
*  to deal with multiple stresses and crises and problems [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3603.3799999999997s)]
*  as he's dealing with everything. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3607.8599999999997s)]
*  He is in the eye of the hurricane, for sure. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3609.8999999999996s)]
*  But learn how to be in the eye of the hurricane. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3611.7s)]
*  And also, he wanted to tell a fuller story around AI. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3615.46s)]
*  Because right now, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3623.22s)]
*  the story around AI is either around productivity. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3626.14s)]
*  It's going to make us more productive. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3631.66s)]
*  You'll have an assistant who can do anything great, fantastic. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3633.62s)]
*  But it doesn't affect millions of people. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3638.2599999999998s)]
*  Or it's about razzle-dazzle features. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3642.18s)]
*  You know, this text will become a video. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3645.22s)]
*  A feature movie. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3648.58s)]
*  A feature movie. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3650.86s)]
*  Your wife will tell you about a podcast she loves, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3653.3s)]
*  not give you the name, but AI will find it. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3657.94s)]
*  Great, fun, fun, okay. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3660.7400000000002s)]
*  But you know, I'm struggling. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3663.02s)]
*  130 million people are struggling with their health. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3666.82s)]
*  Chronic diseases. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3670.54s)]
*  Can you do anything for me? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3671.7400000000002s)]
*  So I think being able to tell a story [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3673.6200000000003s)]
*  for what OpenAI describes as everyday people [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3676.6200000000003s)]
*  is a very important part for all of us [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3682.26s)]
*  who care and believe in AI. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3684.6200000000003s)]
*  It can't just be a tool for the elites, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3687.34s)]
*  while millions of people are simply anxious [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3691.42s)]
*  about AI taking their job. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3694.98s)]
*  If I might, you are very much in the eye [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3698.3s)]
*  of this AI hurricane as well. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3703.42s)]
*  I mean, you know most of the [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3706.1800000000003s)]
*  tech elite to use that term. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3711.86s)]
*  How do you feel about the future of AI? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3715.1800000000003s)]
*  I had, you know, Elon and Jeffrey Hinton [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3717.98s)]
*  and Ray Kurzweil on stage with me [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3721.34s)]
*  at the Abundance Summit last year. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3723.26s)]
*  And the sense was, in summary, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3725.78s)]
*  there's 80% chance AI is gonna be amazing and we're great. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3730.78s)]
*  20% chance we're screwed. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3734.82s)]
*  You know, it's like, how does the public [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3737.1400000000003s)]
*  think about that? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3741.7s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3742.54s)]
*  What's your advice for people thinking about that? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3743.38s)]
*  Well, my advice, and actually I just wrote a piece [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3745.54s)]
*  about Yuval Harari's new book, Nexus. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3749.46s)]
*  And he is a bit of an AI doomsayer, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3753.3s)]
*  but in a very, very interesting, fascinating way [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3756.94s)]
*  because he's brilliant and an amazing public intellectual. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3759.78s)]
*  And my piece focused on certain things he has said [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3764.42s)]
*  that I totally believe in, which is, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3768.98s)]
*  while AI has a long way to go, so do humans. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3773.02s)]
*  We are also a work in progress. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3780.82s)]
*  And if you don't acknowledge that, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3784.06s)]
*  if you don't acknowledge that AI can help us [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3786.18s)]
*  become the best versions of ourselves, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3789.02s)]
*  then I think we are doomed. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3792.62s)]
*  Because ultimately, what we do with AI depends on humans. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3795.34s)]
*  I know that AI is not just a tool, it's an agent, et cetera, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3800.98s)]
*  but ultimately we can't be deterministic about technology. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3805.5s)]
*  And, you know, Yuval said something, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3810.2200000000003s)]
*  actually not in his book, but on the Daily Show, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3814.38s)]
*  that I end my piece on his book with, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3818.3s)]
*  which I want to read it to you if you don't mind. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3823.5800000000004s)]
*  Please, I'd love to, yeah. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3825.34s)]
*  Because I think it's everything I believe [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3826.46s)]
*  about the future of AI. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3829.3s)]
*  He said, if for every dollar and every minute [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3831.3s)]
*  that we invest in developing artificial intelligence, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3835.82s)]
*  we also invest in exploring and developing our own minds, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3840.5s)]
*  it will be okay. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3845.6200000000003s)]
*  But if we put all our bets on technology, on AI, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3847.9s)]
*  and neglect to develop ourselves, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3852.54s)]
*  this is very bad news for humanity. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3855.2599999999998s)]
*  I get that. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3858.58s)]
*  And of course, there are two points of view here. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3860.58s)]
*  Ray's belief is that we are going to merge with AI. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3865.38s)]
*  Definitively, we're giving birth to a new species, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3871.1s)]
*  AI is our progeny, we're feeding it on our data, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3876.06s)]
*  and it's becoming godlike with a small g, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3881.74s)]
*  omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent in so many ways, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3888.02s)]
*  but there is a sense that we will be able to merge [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3891.22s)]
*  with it into the future. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3896.14s)]
*  You know, I like to say, quote one of the singularity [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3897.74s)]
*  faculty, Neil Jacobstein, said, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3901.7s)]
*  I'm not worried about artificial intelligence, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3903.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm worried about human stupidity. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3905.98s)]
*  But my point is that human stupidity is obviously [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3908.14s)]
*  a fact of history, but it doesn't have to be. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3913.14s)]
*  And I love Ray, I think Ray is totally brilliant, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3918.14s)]
*  but I completely disagree with him. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3921.2999999999997s)]
*  I think that human beings have a soul, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3923.8599999999997s)]
*  and AI doesn't. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3929.38s)]
*  And the more we can connect to our soul, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3931.98s)]
*  we will connect to our own wisdom. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3936.14s)]
*  And when we connect to our own wisdom, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3939.22s)]
*  we can yet use AI to be the best versions of ourselves. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3941.58s)]
*  And you know, so Jonathan had this great quote [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3947.2999999999997s)]
*  about how every human being is a mixture. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3950.8599999999997s)]
*  He actually said, the line between good and evil [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3953.98s)]
*  goes through every human heart. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3957.74s)]
*  So how can AI help us activate the best part of us? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3960.82s)]
*  That for me is the greatest hop of AI. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3970.6600000000003s)]
*  AI doesn't have a soul, it doesn't have consciousness, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3975.7400000000002s)]
*  and we do, and we need to access it more. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3979.82s)]
*  You know, why do you think reset works, Peter? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3983.6200000000003s)]
*  It works because we all have a place of peace, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3987.38s)]
*  wisdom, and strength in us. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3992.1s)]
*  Most of the time we're disconnected from it. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3994.46s)]
*  The more we can connect to it, the more we can tap into it, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=3997.82s)]
*  the better everything is, the wiser we are, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4002.86s)]
*  the more compassionate and empathetic we are. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4005.7000000000003s)]
*  And I believe that whether people call themselves atheists [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4008.82s)]
*  or not is irrelevant. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4013.82s)]
*  They still have that place in them. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4014.9s)]
*  Real quick, I've been getting the most unusual compliments [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4017.38s)]
*  lately on my skin. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4020.1800000000003s)]
*  Truth is, I use a lotion every morning and every night [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4021.86s)]
*  religiously called One Skin. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4025.5s)]
*  It was developed by four PhD women [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4027.42s)]
*  who determined a 10 amino acid sequence [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4030.06s)]
*  that is a synolytic that kills senile cells in your skin. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4033.3s)]
*  And this literally reverses the age of your skin. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4037.3s)]
*  And I think it's one of the most common reasons [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4040.6600000000003s)]
*  and I think it's one of the most incredible products. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4042.7799999999997s)]
*  I use it all the time. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4044.94s)]
*  If you're interested, check out the show notes. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4047.3799999999997s)]
*  I've asked my team to link to it below. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4049.18s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the episode. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4051.18s)]
*  I wanna pick up something we mentioned earlier, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4052.94s)]
*  which is the notion that will AI be empathic? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4056.14s)]
*  Will it be, it will be infinitely patient? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4063.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, the notion, it was an interesting study [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4067.02s)]
*  and I think it was in JAMA looking at how, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4069.7s)]
*  if you compare empathy of physicians versus empathy of AIs, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4074.54s)]
*  the AI is one by 10 to one. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4081.74s)]
*  That the AI was infinitely patient, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4084.3399999999997s)]
*  infinitely there to reflect back on you what you said [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4087.9399999999996s)]
*  while a physician, I was talking to a doctor yesterday [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4093.14s)]
*  who has transitioned in her practice, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4097.58s)]
*  but she says, you know, I had an iPad with a countdown timer. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4101.42s)]
*  The patient would walk in, I would hit it [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4105.94s)]
*  and it would count down from seven minutes. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4108.1s)]
*  And by the time it was zero, that patient was out the door [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4109.74s)]
*  with or without being all the questions being answered. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4112.94s)]
*  And that has been American medicine filled with paperwork [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4115.86s)]
*  and insurance forms and all of that stuff. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4119.1s)]
*  How do you think about AIs being empathic [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4121.98s)]
*  and being therapists who don't judge you [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4126.58s)]
*  and will take all the time to help you? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4131.26s)]
*  I completely agree with that. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4133.740000000001s)]
*  That's not AI having a soul, it's AI having a memory. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4135.46s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4138.900000000001s)]
*  And I totally agree. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4139.820000000001s)]
*  It's what you said, the key thing is [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4142.58s)]
*  that you are not being judged. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4144.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a little bit like the GPS in your car. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4146.860000000001s)]
*  You know, if you take the wrong turn, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4150.06s)]
*  the GPS doesn't say, oh, Peter, you're such a... [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4153.46s)]
*  It simply recalculates. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4158.54s)]
*  And that's what AI does, which is great and empathetic, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4161.18s)]
*  but it doesn't mean that it's a transcendent being. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4165.78s)]
*  You know, I mean, I happen to be a deep believer [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4169.9800000000005s)]
*  in a transcendent reality. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4175.5s)]
*  And whatever religion you are at the heart of it [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4178.34s)]
*  in its esoteric form, whether it's Christianity, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4185.06s)]
*  Judaism, Islam, Judaism, you know, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4188.62s)]
*  there is that truth that unites us. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4193.26s)]
*  And as I said, most of the time we're not connected to it. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4198.5s)]
*  But- [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4203.54s)]
*  Yes, our mind is whizzing away. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4204.38s)]
*  Our mind is whizzing away. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4206.22s)]
*  We are driven by fears, anxiety. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4208.740000000001s)]
*  The more we can connect to that, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4211.9400000000005s)]
*  the wiser and the healthier we'll be, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4215.06s)]
*  and the more empathetic. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4217.820000000001s)]
*  And you know, that's one of the things [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4219.9800000000005s)]
*  the coach is going to do. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4222.66s)]
*  Let's say it will find out from you, Peter, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4224.740000000001s)]
*  what are some of the things that must connect you [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4227.740000000001s)]
*  to that deeper part? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4231.02s)]
*  It could be a piece of poetry that you barely remember. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4231.9400000000005s)]
*  It could be a song that you heard in Greece. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4237.06s)]
*  It could be a hymn, because a lot of people who are atheists [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4240.38s)]
*  may have gone to church early on, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4243.54s)]
*  and there is a hymn that evokes something in them. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4245.820000000001s)]
*  And we'll feed you these things. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4249.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, our Greek compatriots said, know thyself. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4251.740000000001s)]
*  Nobody's going to know us better than atheists. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4255.9800000000005s)]
*  Nos esepton, yes. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4258.1s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4260.18s)]
*  You know, and it's, so some people who are cynical [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4261.02s)]
*  will say, oh, so you'll just get manipulated by AI to be, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4265.9s)]
*  but you're choosing to ask the AI to help get you [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4270.58s)]
*  into a better state of mind, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4275.339999999999s)]
*  because no one likes being stressed. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4276.98s)]
*  And also, Peter, we're being manipulated [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4279.299999999999s)]
*  all the time right now. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4283.94s)]
*  By the news media, for sure. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4285.62s)]
*  But we're by social media, news media, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4286.82s)]
*  but we're being hacked, you know, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4289.62s)]
*  to be the worst version of ourselves. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4293.299999999999s)]
*  We're being hacked by tapping into our biases, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4296.78s)]
*  our outrage, our anger. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4298.94s)]
*  I believe companies can make a lot of money [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4302.9s)]
*  by hacking into what's good in us. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4305.74s)]
*  I believe that, Arianna, and, you know, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4310.38s)]
*  grateful to you for this, you know, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4313.7s)]
*  third act in your entrepreneurial life. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4318.66s)]
*  You know, I want to balance an idea off you, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4323.22s)]
*  which is the idea of wisdom. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4327.06s)]
*  Sophia, you know, if you were to ask the question, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4329.740000000001s)]
*  what makes a person wise, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4334.1s)]
*  or people who are on a sort of a wisdom council, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4336.42s)]
*  I would imagine it is because they've seen enough things [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4340.54s)]
*  to have experienced them to be able to say, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4346.06s)]
*  young woman or young man, if you go down that path, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4350.78s)]
*  it ends, you know, in a poor fashion. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4353.38s)]
*  This way has a possibility, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4358.179999999999s)]
*  but this way, while it's more difficult, is, you know, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4360.46s)]
*  and they have that wisdom through experience [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4362.94s)]
*  in their own lives and passed down from previous generations. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4367.86s)]
*  And I think of that as wisdom. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4370.94s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4372.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4373.7s)]
*  So here's the question. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4375.139999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to see a world in the very near future [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4377.7s)]
*  where AIs are able to simulate billions of scenarios [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4382.22s)]
*  in society to be able to say probabilistically [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4389.22s)]
*  for the situation that you're in, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4396.22s)]
*  this is the path that is the greatest, you know, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4398.66s)]
*  greatest probability of a positive outcome. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4403.0599999999995s)]
*  And so I do think we can see wisdom from that definition [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4406.379999999999s)]
*  coming out of AI simulation systems. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4410.78s)]
*  But I think there is more to wisdom. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4413.419999999999s)]
*  First of all, can we all agree that at the moment, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4416.179999999999s)]
*  we are drowning in data? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4419.62s)]
*  There's never been more data in the world, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4421.86s)]
*  and we are starved for wisdom. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4423.9s)]
*  I would say those are both true statements. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4426.94s)]
*  And it's not because we don't have amazing technology. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4429.66s)]
*  Wisdom is something more. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4434.1s)]
*  Wisdom is connected to the deepest part of ourselves, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4436.860000000001s)]
*  to our intuition, to our sense of wonder about the universe, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4441.5s)]
*  to the ability to forgive and to love. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4446.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, it's connected with the deepest things [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4452.780000000001s)]
*  that make us human. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4455.780000000001s)]
*  It's not just about deciding what road to take. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4456.860000000001s)]
*  It's about, you know, if you take Marcus Aurelius, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4461.66s)]
*  who I believe is the greatest leadership philosopher, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4464.22s)]
*  I have his book, Meditations, on my nightstand [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4468.9400000000005s)]
*  and read a page before I go to sleep, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4472.38s)]
*  because he was in the world. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4475.3s)]
*  He was the emperor of Rome for 19 years. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4477.7s)]
*  He dealt with every crisis, plague, betrayals, invasions, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4482.22s)]
*  and he was able to be unflappable. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4488.14s)]
*  He epitomized wisdom, and his philosophy was that, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4492.18s)]
*  I can, I, Marcus Aurelius, I, Arianna, you, Peter, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4498.9400000000005s)]
*  cannot control events. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4502.54s)]
*  The only thing we can control is how we respond to events. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4505.5s)]
*  And if we learn to respond without being reactive, angry, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4510.780000000001s)]
*  in reality, I don't mean not showing it, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4517.46s)]
*  I mean not feeling it, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4521.5s)]
*  then we have what Hugo Harari in his book [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4524.58s)]
*  calls the self-correcting mechanisms. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4530.7s)]
*  You know, we all need sharper self-correcting mechanisms [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4534.9400000000005s)]
*  because we are human. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4538.62s)]
*  We're going to make a lot of mistakes. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4540.42s)]
*  How quickly can we course correct? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4543.66s)]
*  And how quickly can we forgive? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4545.98s)]
*  I think forgiveness is at the heart of wisdom. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4547.78s)]
*  I agree, I've got, you know, one of, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4551.54s)]
*  nevermind, please, it's, my mom will love you [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4554.98s)]
*  for saying all of this, for sure. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4558.58s)]
*  But that's it, the wisdom of your mom and my mom. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4560.74s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4565.299999999999s)]
*  That's wisdom. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4566.139999999999s)]
*  You know, and it's different than your mom [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4568.86s)]
*  or your mom giving us advice as to what decision to make, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4571.42s)]
*  which I can absolutely help us do. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4575.06s)]
*  But what your mom and my mom taught us was deeper. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4578.26s)]
*  Yep, which is the root of family as foundational in society. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4581.700000000001s)]
*  Exactly. That's so important. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4587.740000000001s)]
*  Arianna Mu, I am so grateful for this time. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4588.9400000000005s)]
*  I want to say thank you for all you do. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4593.22s)]
*  It's not a surprise that you're the number one woman [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4595.46s)]
*  on LinkedIn, the fifth most followed person on LinkedIn [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4599.860000000001s)]
*  in general. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4605.58s)]
*  They can find you at Arianna Huffington on LinkedIn. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4606.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4610.66s)]
*  Is that your social? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4611.5s)]
*  And then to learn more about Thrive Global, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4612.34s)]
*  how, where should they go? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4616.86s)]
*  Should they go to their companies and ask their- [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4618.0599999999995s)]

*  All right, ask your CHRO to get your company [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4626.78s)]
*  on Thrive Global so that your company can make more money [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4630.259999999999s)]

*  And Peter, I just love this. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4638.26s)]
*  I treasure our friendship, my God, 20 years. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2gcvtmb5o8&t=4641.3s)]
