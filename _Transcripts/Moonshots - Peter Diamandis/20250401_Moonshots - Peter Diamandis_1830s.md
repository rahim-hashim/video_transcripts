# AI Venture Capitalist: These Tech Predictions Will Change Everything by 2030 w/ Vinod Khosla | #159
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo)
*  The only thing we know about the future is it'll be uncertain. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=0.0s)]
*  We have to figure it out in increments. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=4.28s)]
*  Vinod Khosla. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=6.8s)]
*  Vinod Khosla. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=7.7s)]
*  Vinod Khosla. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=8.76s)]
*  From Sun Microsystems. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=9.68s)]
*  To billion dollar beds. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=11.0s)]
*  He is shaping the future of AI, clean energy, and biotech. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=12.32s)]
*  How do you think about the future of programming? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=15.88s)]
*  No more programmers or everyone's a programmer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  In the past, users of computers have had to learn computers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  I think in the future, computers will learn humans. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  There are no resource limitations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=29.479999999999997s)]
*  Technology is a force that converts whatever was scarce into abundance. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=30.959999999999997s)]
*  This business of bipedal robots will be larger than the auto industry within 20 years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=34.92s)]
*  And the auto industry doesn't know it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=41.56s)]
*  What's going to be the impact on them? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=43.6s)]
*  Well, let me put it this way. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=45.8s)]
*  Now that's a moonshot, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=50.2s)]
*  Welcome, Vinod. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=60.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=61.36s)]
*  It's been too long. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=62.36s)]
*  It's been long, but it's great to see people who believe in abundance. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=64.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=70.36s)]
*  To see so many people who believe in it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=71.12s)]
*  So congratulations for that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=74.24s)]
*  My favorite saying is skeptics never did the impossible. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=80.88s)]
*  So that's a good place to start. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=81.44s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=83.12s)]
*  And I've had the pleasure of knowing you for a couple of decades now and to be in some [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=85.56s)]
*  deals together through Bold Capital. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=92.4s)]
*  But I always love your vision. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=95.72s)]
*  But I think it's important for you to realize that Vinod, beyond being a great investor, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  is an entrepreneur and a company builder. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=103.0s)]
*  You've built some extraordinary companies. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=106.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  I want to read a... [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=108.68s)]
*  I have to say, in 40 years, I haven't once called myself an investor. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Because I don't like investors very much. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  So in December 23, I have a wide range of questions. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  I try and get through as many as we can. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  And please take your questions down for Vinod, because we'll be going to Q&A with him and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=125.28s)]
*  Brett shortly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=129.68s)]
*  So December 23, you predicted a billion bipedal robots by 2040 and that the robots would play [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=130.44s)]
*  a larger role than the auto industry. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  And six months ago, you suggested robots could be at 10K and be as essential as smartphone. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=139.72s)]
*  So coming off of Brett's presentation, talk to me about your thoughts on... [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=146.12s)]
*  I think Brett is right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=149.52s)]
*  It is going to be a large business. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=152.4s)]
*  And from a situational awareness point of view, how many people have read the situational [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=155.04s)]
*  awareness paper? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=160.36s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=162.84s)]
*  For the rest of you, you should read it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=163.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=165.12s)]
*  And if you don't want to read the whole thing, grab the paper, put it in Notebook LM and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=165.64s)]
*  listen to the podcast. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=173.04s)]
*  It is an extraordinary paper. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is extraordinary. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  I think what I would say is this business of bipedal robots or some equivalent like that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  in various form factors and configurations will be larger than the auto industry within [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=189.12s)]
*  20 years and the auto industry doesn't know it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=197.24s)]
*  So when, if we have a billion bipedal robots, and I think that's an underestimate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=200.76s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=205.96s)]
*  First, these robots will do more work than all of the manual labor humanity does across [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=207.4s)]
*  seven billion people today. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=214.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=217.0s)]
*  And there may be many more than a billion and they'll be working 24-7, not eight hours [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=217.8s)]
*  with breaks. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=224.68s)]
*  So the capacity for labor goes up dramatically while AGI, we can address that, increases [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=226.24s)]
*  the capacity for human thinking and human expertise, which will essentially be free. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=234.68s)]
*  We can come back to that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=240.0s)]
*  But it's such a large opportunity that very few people and almost nobody in the group [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=241.76s)]
*  that should understand this, which is the auto industry, their biggest opportunity has [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  failed to recognize it except Elon. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=256.84s)]
*  Elon says it will be bigger. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=259.84s)]
*  It'll be the biggest part of Tesla will be optimist. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=262.88s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=265.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=266.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=268.24s)]
*  You go on in your predictions, you mentioned expertise will be free with AI based tutors [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  and doctors 24-7. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=273.28s)]
*  And so for the abundance members here that are running health care and education companies, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  what's going to be the impact on them? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=281.28s)]
*  Well, let me put it this way. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=284.36s)]
*  It was 2012. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=287.08s)]
*  I wrote a blog, two blogs. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=288.56s)]
*  The first one was called Do We Need Doctors? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=290.84s)]
*  Just to be a little conversational. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  And now it's clear they will play a minor role in health care. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=295.72s)]
*  They will play a role in certain levels of human connection. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  That'll be important. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  And my second blog was Do We Need Teachers? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=308.04s)]
*  And frankly, I just saw a piece out of Beijing today about why the Chinese government is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  going to adapt AI tutors for kids. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=318.04s)]
*  So this was 2012. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=320.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=322.76000000000005s)]
*  Almost certainly, no matter what expertise you're talking about, AI doctors, AI teachers, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=324.04s)]
*  AI oncologists, AI structural engineers, AI accountants. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, we investing in all these. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=337.04s)]
*  Any place the US Bureau of Labor says there's more than 100,000 workers in that category, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=339.44s)]
*  we should be investing in all these categories. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=345.76s)]
*  So what will its impact be? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=349.68s)]
*  At the level, you have to talk about timeframes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=352.68s)]
*  The next five years, all of you should be thinking every single professional can get [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  five AI interns. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=364.72s)]
*  So if you're an MD, you can supervise five AI interns just like they graduated out of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=366.6s)]
*  St. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=373.56s)]
*  Ferdinand School. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=374.12s)]
*  If you're an accountant, you already had junior accountants fresh out of school. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=375.64s)]
*  Imagine five AI intern accountants in whether they grow up in three years, five years or [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  10 years. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=387.4s)]
*  A little hard to predict and vary by category. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=388.2s)]
*  But that's a good model to think about. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=390.8s)]
*  First, leveraging expertise. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=393.8s)]
*  But the more interesting question that I've asked a number of boards I speak to in the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=395.8s)]
*  health care business is if all expertise were free, how would you design a health care [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=401.8s)]
*  system? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=408.68s)]
*  I think that's the right question. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=409.36s)]
*  That's the right model. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=411.76s)]
*  That's the right model for if you're a health care provider of any sort. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=412.68s)]
*  But let me go a little further and say at the national policy level, if a farm worker [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=417.44s)]
*  and an oncologist have exactly the same expertise up level to what an AI has, how do you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=425.2s)]
*  pay people? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=431.48s)]
*  Interesting question to ask. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=433.24s)]
*  Everybody, I hope you're enjoying this episode. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  You know, earlier this year, I was joined on stage at the 2025 Abundance Summit by a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=437.72s)]
*  rock star group of entrepreneurs, CEOs, investors focused on the vision and future for AGI, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  humanoid robotics, longevity, blockchain, basically the next trillion dollar opportunities. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=450.56s)]
*  If you weren't at the Abundance Summit, it's not too late. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=455.92s)]
*  You can watch the entire Abundance Summit online by going to exponentialmastery.com. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=458.48s)]
*  That's exponentialmastery.com. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=464.52s)]
*  You've said that the most consumer access of the Internet could be agents acting for [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=467.2s)]
*  consumers. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=473.56s)]
*  I don't think my agent is going to be interested in Google ads or is interested in a TV [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=475.04s)]
*  commercial of somebody with white teeth on a toothpaste. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=484.04s)]
*  What happens to advertising if agents are doing the buying? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=488.76s)]
*  I actually might disagree. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=491.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=493.56s)]
*  First, I'd say the one thing that's clear is the level of unpredictability in all this, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=493.76s)]
*  including what I say. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=499.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=501.0s)]
*  The only thing we know about the future is we'll probably be wrong. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=502.12s)]
*  Well, the only thing we know about the future is it'll be uncertain. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=506.4s)]
*  We have to figure it out in increments. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=510.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=512.6s)]
*  But what is advertising? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=513.24s)]
*  It's information. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=516.0s)]
*  To emotionally induce us into buying a $300 pair of jeans when $30 Levi's will do just [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  fine, that's a filter the AI can apply. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=528.96s)]
*  So the nature of advertising, I suspect, will change to more informational, which is the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  original purpose of advertising. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  It has switched to one of my big beefs with capitalism is mostly capitalism is about [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  making you buy things you had no intention of buying. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=551.68s)]
*  That's what advertising has become. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=555.28s)]
*  But that's not what it was. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=557.7199999999999s)]
*  And so making people buy things they don't want to buy or had no intention of buying [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=560.7199999999999s)]
*  makes them unhappy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=567.28s)]
*  That doesn't add to societal good. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=569.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=572.8s)]
*  But information is valuable. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=573.6s)]
*  In frankly, I think people will pivot into other models. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=575.52s)]
*  I mean, chat GPD has been phenomenally successful and nobody thought consumers would [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=581.28s)]
*  pay $20 a month. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=588.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=590.56s)]
*  I you know, look, if that was true, that's more revenue per user than Google or Facebook [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=591.28s)]
*  get. In fact, they should have tried this model earlier if they added enough value, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=598.56s)]
*  which, you know, in the past, pre-AI, they had added a lot of value. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=607.56s)]
*  So where will this stop? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=612.2399999999999s)]
*  You know, the $200 a month level of chat GPD is incredibly valuable. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=614.4s)]
*  How many people have tried it? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  A good number of hands. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=624.0799999999999s)]
*  How many people have tried deep research? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=625.28s)]
*  Yeah, it is amazing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=629.52s)]
*  Like it is way more valuable. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=631.16s)]
*  I'll tell you a fun story. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=633.68s)]
*  My chief of staff is a PhD in viral immunology, and we were researching a particular [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=635.0s)]
*  application like a developmental model, a model for developmental biology, a [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=641.4799999999999s)]
*  fundamental foundation model for developmental biology. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  She did an 18 page report for me, including recommending what indications to go into. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  After she'd finished, I said, just enter into deep research and give it some time to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=659.04s)]
*  think. Coincidentally, it came back with an 18 page report and the same two end [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  disease indications to go after. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=671.4s)]
*  Now that's mind blowing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=674.0799999999999s)]
*  It is. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=675.76s)]
*  How much did you pay deep research for that? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=676.68s)]
*  Not a lot. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=678.68s)]
*  Well worth it for anybody who hasn't tried it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=680.3599999999999s)]
*  I was just talking to the CFO. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=683.76s)]
*  So I gave you a very technical example. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=688.8399999999999s)]
*  I was talking to the CFO of OpenAI and she was talking to a retailer. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  You've been a big investor supporter of OpenAI. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we committed in 2018 and you have to believe in things. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=699.0s)]
*  And I believed in it enough to make the largest initial investment I'd ever made by a [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=704.16s)]
*  factor of two. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=711.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  In 40 years of venture capital, I'd never even made an investment half the size [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=712.56s)]
*  because I was a believer. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=718.36s)]
*  That's turned out well. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=720.12s)]
*  Yeah, it has turned out well. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=721.1999999999999s)]
*  But my point is this retailer's CEO was talking to her and he said he had just [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=722.28s)]
*  finished a large strategy review on what products to add to their retail operation. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=732.4s)]
*  She while on the call, someone deep research. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=739.24s)]
*  It came back with a report she gave to him almost instantly, tens of minutes. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=746.6800000000001s)]
*  And he said, you know, to be honest, this was a better report than my strategy team [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=753.08s)]
*  produced over the last however many months. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=758.72s)]
*  So we are at a transition point. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=762.84s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things I tell people, you know, you're not using this [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=765.08s)]
*  technology, even a fraction of your potential. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=770.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=774.08s)]
*  Is it open in every board meeting? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=774.2800000000001s)]
*  Is it open every, every executive meeting? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=775.84s)]
*  Are you giving it the same challenges you're giving your team? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=778.2s)]
*  Let's talk about. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=784.2s)]
*  Yeah, look, the other thing I want to add is the range of applicable applicability is [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  large from what products should a retailer add? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=791.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  To I was sitting in a scientific meeting for a couple of days, multiple days, a small [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=796.4s)]
*  group of scientists going after a particular topic of personal interest to me. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=806.52s)]
*  So I sat in and anything I didn't understand. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=810.88s)]
*  And then. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=815.32s)]
*  ChatGPD was able to explain to me where I could really not only follow the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=817.2800000000001s)]
*  conversation, but ask not so dumb questions. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=821.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=825.44s)]
*  I mean, it is a superpower. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=826.36s)]
*  And one of the things I love, I keep on mentioning this is the ability to ask it to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=827.72s)]
*  look at something from a completely different perspective. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=831.6400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=834.72s)]
*  My favorite is like, how would Steve Jobs answer this question? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=835.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=839.4000000000001s)]
*  And we are so limited inside our organization by the knowledge and the opinions that we [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=840.8000000000001s)]
*  have in our team that why would you limit yourself in that way? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=846.64s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  The best example is the road 37 example. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=852.1600000000001s)]
*  Of course, you know, centuries of humans hadn't come up with the road 37 example, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=855.48s)]
*  because we look incrementally about upon what others have done, not think outside the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=861.48s)]
*  box. So that's a real massive accelerator for humanity pretty soon when AI does [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=867.88s)]
*  science and scientists and things. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=874.52s)]
*  Do you believe that most Nobel prizes in the future will get basically derived from [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=876.88s)]
*  AI human partnerships or AI alone? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  Possibly AI alone. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=886.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think that will happen. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=888.4799999999999s)]
*  Now, whether us humans will allow recognize it as recognized AI as winning, capable of [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=891.28s)]
*  winning a Nobel Prize, that's a human limitation. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=897.24s)]
*  But that's also true in most creative tasks. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=900.88s)]
*  Let's go into programming. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=907.04s)]
*  So probably the single area that's had the most success with the LLMs besides just [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=908.76s)]
*  written word has been programming. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=914.64s)]
*  How do you think about the future of programming? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=919.16s)]
*  Is it a future of no more programmers or everyone's a programmer? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=922.2s)]
*  Both. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=928.24s)]
*  So we investors, to be fair, in cognition, that doesn't give you a copilot like [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=929.64s)]
*  Microsoft does for a programmer. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=935.72s)]
*  It does the programming for you. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=937.64s)]
*  And their model is very much what I explained earlier. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=939.96s)]
*  They'll give you a software intern who can program an intern programmer today, and [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=943.64s)]
*  they'll grow up in seniority and experience over time. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=950.84s)]
*  At the other end, we investors in Replet. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=954.76s)]
*  Which company? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  Replet. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=960.1999999999999s)]
*  So you don't need to know anything about programming or even know the names of the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=961.1999999999999s)]
*  language you're coding in. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=966.68s)]
*  You just speak in English language and it codes for you. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=968.36s)]
*  So whether you're an individual, your son or daughter asks you a particular question, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=974.04s)]
*  you want to build a model of the planetary system, you just code it in Replet without [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=981.48s)]
*  ever having touched code or knowing anything about coding. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=987.48s)]
*  That as well as, you know, if there's an employee in a large enterprise and this is [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=991.84s)]
*  starting to happen, every employee can write their own applications without going to [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=999.84s)]
*  IT. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1005.76s)]
*  So any of you who worked in large companies and need to go through IT and security [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1006.84s)]
*  reviews and all that other stuff, know how freeing it is if you don't have to deal with [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1012.4399999999999s)]
*  IT at all. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1018.52s)]
*  You can just program your apps on in English language. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1019.92s)]
*  So there's a fundamental thing I like to say. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1023.72s)]
*  In the past, users of computers have had to learn computers. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1027.24s)]
*  You get trained on SAP or Oracle or Workday or your favorite application. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1033.08s)]
*  I think in the future, instead of humans learning computers, computers will learn [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1039.8s)]
*  humans and humans won't have to adapt to how our program works. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1044.36s)]
*  The notion of a menu will go away, I think. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1050.1999999999998s)]
*  It's about 13 years ago, I had my two kids, my two boys, and I remember at that moment [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1053.12s)]
*  in time, I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1058.52s)]
*  Without question, I wanted to see their kids, their grandkids, and really, you know, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1062.52s)]
*  during this extraordinary time where the space frontier and AI and crypto is all [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1068.16s)]
*  exploding, it was like the most exciting time ever to be alive. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1072.92s)]
*  And I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1076.72s)]
*  And I've done that in three key areas. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1080.0s)]
*  The first is going every year for a fountain upload. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1082.88s)]
*  Fountain is one of the most advanced diagnostics and therapeutics companies. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1087.72s)]
*  I go there, upload myself, digitize myself, about 200 gigabytes of data that the AI [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1091.2s)]
*  system is able to look at to catch disease at inception. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1097.56s)]
*  You know, look for any cardiovascular, any cancer, neurodegenerative disease, any [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1101.76s)]
*  metabolic disease. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1106.2s)]
*  These things are all going on all the time and you can prevent them if you can [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1107.88s)]
*  find them at inception. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1112.32s)]
*  So super important. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1113.88s)]
*  So fountain is one of my keys. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1115.16s)]
*  I make it available to the CEOs of all my companies, my family members, because [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1116.48s)]
*  health is a new wealth. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1121.52s)]
*  But beyond that, we are a collection of 40 trillion human cells and about another [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1123.92s)]
*  100 trillion bacterial cells, fungi, viri. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1129.44s)]
*  And we don't understand how that impacts us. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1133.1200000000001s)]
*  And so I use a company and a product called Viome. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1137.16s)]
*  And Viome has a technology called Metatranscriptomics, it was actually developed [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1141.0s)]
*  in New Mexico, the same place where the nuclear bomb was developed as a [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1148.04s)]
*  bio-defense weapon. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1152.52s)]
*  And their technology is able to help you understand what's going on in your body [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1153.72s)]
*  to understand which bacteria are producing which proteins. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1160.28s)]
*  And as a consequence of that, what foods are your superfoods that are best for you [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1163.32s)]
*  to eat or what food should you avoid? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1168.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1171.3999999999999s)]
*  What's going on in your oral microbiome? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1171.68s)]
*  So I use their testing to understand my foods, understand my medicines, understand [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  my supplements, and Viome really helps me understand from a biological and data [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1180.6s)]
*  standpoint, what's best for me. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1186.04s)]
*  And then finally, you know, feeling good, being intelligent, moving well is [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1189.0s)]
*  critical, but looking good. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1193.12s)]
*  When you look yourself in the mirror saying, you know, I feel great about life [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1194.28s)]
*  is so important, right? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1198.1599999999999s)]
*  And so a product I use every day, twice a day is called OneSkin, developed by four [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1200.0800000000002s)]
*  incredible PhD women that found this 10 amino acid peptide that's able to zap [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1206.44s)]
*  senile cells in your skin and really help you stay youthful in your look and [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1212.92s)]
*  appearance. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1218.3600000000001s)]
*  So for me, these are three technologies I love and I use all the time. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1219.5600000000002s)]
*  I'll have my team link to those in the show notes down below. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1224.92s)]
*  Please check them out. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1228.72s)]
*  Anyway, hope you enjoyed that. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1230.2s)]
*  Now back to the episode. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1231.7600000000002s)]
*  I remember early on the Palm pilot had us adapting to it to have the proper [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1233.24s)]
*  language. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1241.4s)]
*  And then finally the computer got smart enough to adapt to us. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1242.0s)]
*  Energy. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1245.68s)]
*  Energy is one of the single most important things from so many with tips [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1246.2s)]
*  health, it tips AI, it tips everything. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1249.48s)]
*  You've been a huge investor proponent across a multitude of different energy [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1252.3600000000001s)]
*  investments. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1256.6000000000001s)]
*  How are you thinking about where we're in the near term and the middle term? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1257.56s)]
*  Well, so I am pretty optimistic about energy in about climate solutions. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1261.44s)]
*  So let's talk about energy. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1270.1200000000001s)]
*  Coincidentally, the year we committed to opening, I which was 2018, we made two [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1273.56s)]
*  other investments. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1280.4s)]
*  I'm very proud of one was Commonwealth Fusion. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1282.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1285.4s)]
*  Happened to be same time. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1285.88s)]
*  They weren't orchestrated. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1287.16s)]
*  I didn't connect AI will need more power. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1288.68s)]
*  So it wasn't that visionary. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1291.0s)]
*  And the third was another one of my favorites, which hopefully we'll have [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1293.16s)]
*  time to talk about public transit using AI. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1296.6000000000001s)]
*  It completely upends every assumption about public transit. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1301.16s)]
*  There is no chance if you have a chauffeured car, it'll be more convenient [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1307.8000000000002s)]
*  than public transit. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1313.24s)]
*  That's the world we're going towards. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1314.2s)]
*  I suspect most cars in most cities will be replaced by 2050. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1315.48s)]
*  But let's talk about energy. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1320.3600000000001s)]
*  So let's talk about. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1322.1200000000001s)]
*  So Commonwealth is a fusion company. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1322.92s)]
*  Last time I looked the node, there were some, I mean, blows me away. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1325.8s)]
*  There was something like 40 VC funded fusion companies, which I would have [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1329.0s)]
*  never imagined. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1335.16s)]
*  Well, you couldn't imagine that till 2018. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1335.8s)]
*  Nobody wanted to fund fusion. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1339.32s)]
*  I won't name the names who said never to me when we funded it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1341.32s)]
*  They said, are you really you're being ridiculous. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1345.72s)]
*  It's 50 years. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1348.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1350.12s)]
*  It's always been 50 years in weight and holding. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1350.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1352.9199999999998s)]
*  And the Department of Energy didn't want to talk about fusion as an energy [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1353.32s)]
*  source when I visited them. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1357.8s)]
*  We invested anyway. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1359.3999999999999s)]
*  Almost certainly, this won't be a question in five years. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1362.52s)]
*  So my current perspective is everything we can make happen by 2030. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1367.32s)]
*  By 2030, nobody will be debating whether fusions of economic possibility. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1371.72s)]
*  There may be some question of exactly how much it costs. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1378.9199999999998s)]
*  So educate us one second on Commonwealth. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1382.9199999999998s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1385.72s)]
*  What have they been able to demonstrate? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1387.32s)]
*  So, you know, without going into details, they expect to be able to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1388.9199999999998s)]
*  demonstrate positive energy, net energy output, net energy output by early 2027 [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1394.52s)]
*  and start soon thereafter the construction of their first plant. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1405.32s)]
*  And they've announced a site for it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1410.1999999999998s)]
*  In the interest of time, let me just say they won't build fusion power plants. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1414.12s)]
*  The fastest way to deploy fusion, I believe one of my forecast is we will replace [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1420.6000000000001s)]
*  every coal and natural gas plant in this country by just repowering the boiler. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1427.08s)]
*  So we'll have a fusion. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1434.1200000000001s)]
*  Love that vision. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1435.88s)]
*  You know, the environmentalists who say, well, we need to shut down all the coal plants. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1438.1200000000001s)]
*  I think we will repower them with fusion boilers and maybe a turbine change and [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1442.8400000000001s)]
*  steam conditions. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1447.72s)]
*  There's lots of technical detail, but you don't need 10 years of permitting, 10 years [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1448.6000000000001s)]
*  of getting a grid connection, power lines, all that stuff. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1453.64s)]
*  You just retrofit the same locations. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1458.1200000000001s)]
*  That's why I'm optimistic this won't be a problem. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1460.68s)]
*  There's another technology that nobody's talking about. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1464.44s)]
*  Please. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1468.04s)]
*  Geothermal. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1469.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1470.44s)]
*  We've toyed at the edges. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1471.32s)]
*  We need better drilling. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1473.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1475.0s)]
*  So turns out the same well, if it's 200 degrees or 250 degrees, which is almost all [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1475.56s)]
*  geothermal anywhere in the world today, produces a certain amount of power. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1483.6399999999999s)]
*  But you take that drill to 400 degrees or 450 degrees, you get 10 times the power out [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1490.04s)]
*  of the same well. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1497.08s)]
*  Suddenly super hot geothermal, as it's called, is cheaper than natural gas. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1498.76s)]
*  And I think that will be deployed well before 2030. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1506.04s)]
*  We have two different efforts. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1509.8799999999999s)]
*  The hard part is drilling at high temperatures because metal becomes soft and metal can't [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1511.6399999999999s)]
*  drill in hard rock. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1516.6s)]
*  And sometimes hard rock is hard to frack. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1518.2s)]
*  Both those technologies are well on their way and will surprise us in how much power [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1521.72s)]
*  they can generate. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1528.28s)]
*  Do you want to jump into cultured meat? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1530.6799999999998s)]
*  Do you want to dive into transportation? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1535.0800000000002s)]
*  What are you most excited about? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1537.4s)]
*  I'm very excited about transportation. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1538.52s)]
*  Let's go there. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1540.28s)]
*  What does it look like? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1542.04s)]
*  I want to go from point A to point B in the future. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1542.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1544.6000000000001s)]
*  So here's what it looks like. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1545.0800000000002s)]
*  First, let me start by what it shouldn't be and what the right role for self-driving [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1547.48s)]
*  cars are. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1552.3600000000001s)]
*  When we added Uber to cities, what happened? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1554.1200000000001s)]
*  Congestion increased. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1557.4s)]
*  Simulate driverless cars and they'll increase even more. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1559.48s)]
*  So we'll have gridlock but people won't be driving. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1563.72s)]
*  Driverless cars are cool. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1570.3600000000001s)]
*  I recommend everybody fly to a site that has driverless cars and try them. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1572.0400000000002s)]
*  They're amazing. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1576.92s)]
*  But they increase congestion. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1579.72s)]
*  So what should you do? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1582.92s)]
*  Driverless public transit, that is personal vehicles. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1584.2800000000002s)]
*  So you get off your restaurant job at 1 a.m. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1588.1200000000001s)]
*  A car shows up for you. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1591.24s)]
*  You don't need to know when on the schedule. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1592.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1595.56s)]
*  Because there's no driver. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1595.9599999999998s)]
*  So your cost is zero to have a car available when you show up, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1597.9599999999998s)]
*  not when the public transit is scheduled. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1602.36s)]
*  It gets to where you're going. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1604.84s)]
*  Independent time of day, traffic lights, doesn't stop anywhere, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1606.9199999999998s)]
*  gets to your destination and drops you off. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1610.76s)]
*  And because it's personal, nobody gets picked up or dropped off along the way. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1613.8799999999999s)]
*  So it will always be faster than a chauffeur-driven car. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1617.8799999999999s)]
*  That's the right use of self-driving. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1621.8s)]
*  And then off these fixed routes is when a Waymo might make sense for the last mile. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1624.28s)]
*  And I think it has a useful purpose. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1633.8s)]
*  But here's the fundamental thing. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1636.44s)]
*  What is the one thing, if you ask basic question, that's limited in cities? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1638.04s)]
*  It's street widths. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1645.56s)]
*  Only one thing limited. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1647.16s)]
*  Everything else you can change. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1648.6s)]
*  And so if you can increase the throughput of city streets, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1651.24s)]
*  because you're not going to destroy the buildings on both sides of a street, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1656.28s)]
*  you've got solved congestion. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1661.16s)]
*  Turns out with a self-driving system like this, if you model it, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1663.56s)]
*  it can 10x the capacity of a street by building more capacity than light rail [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1668.6s)]
*  in a bicycle lane width. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1678.6s)]
*  That's the system we are designing. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1680.92s)]
*  It can run in bicycle lanes on the road in cordoned off areas, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1683.32s)]
*  not interacting with other traffic because that's key to throughput. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1687.6399999999999s)]
*  But 10x the capacity of street, you've suddenly created 10 streets wherever you had one. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1691.96s)]
*  And regular cars can just still flow without disrupting the thing. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1699.24s)]
*  This is a far better solution than congestion charges [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1704.36s)]
*  and New York has 14 streets you can't have public or private cars on. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1709.24s)]
*  Constraints isn't the right way to go. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1715.72s)]
*  Getting 10x more capacity is the right way to go. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1718.84s)]
*  And then you can solve the housing problem too, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1722.28s)]
*  because you can live further away and have the same 30-minute commute. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1725.32s)]
*  I love that. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1729.32s)]
*  I want to close on a question before we go to the Q&A. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1730.6s)]
*  So please, again, get your questions ready. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1734.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, I have been so adamant since I wrote Abundance with Steven Kotler about [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1736.44s)]
*  there is no resource constraints. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1742.3600000000001s)]
*  There are no resource limitations. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1746.3600000000001s)]
*  Technology is a force that converts whatever was scarce into abundance. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1748.0400000000002s)]
*  I think you agree with that. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1752.7600000000002s)]
*  I 100% agree with that. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1755.16s)]
*  And I would urge somebody to ask me the question that always gets hacked. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1758.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, we have restricted amount of minerals, or metals, or ores. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1762.2s)]
*  Turns out it's a constraint because we are not looking or not looking with the right tools. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1767.64s)]
*  So we have a separate effort to look under the earth's surface for minerals and metals. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1774.2s)]
*  We only mine stuff that's on the surface mostly. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1782.04s)]
*  The most convenient stuff you run into. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1785.16s)]
*  Yeah, accidentally run into. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1787.16s)]
*  And if we can look a kilometer under the earth's surface, we'll have plenty of abundance of [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1789.4s)]
*  minerals, metals, cobalt, lithium, whatever you're looking for. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1795.4s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1798.8400000000001s)]
*  All right, guys, let's give it up for Vinod Khosla. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_-DGzB9bo&t=1800.0400000000002s)]
