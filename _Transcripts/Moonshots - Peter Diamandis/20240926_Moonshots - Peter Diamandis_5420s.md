*  IOMS is amazing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=38.12s)]
*  There is no such thing as universal healthy food. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=39.12s)]
*  It is simply good for you right now or bad for you right now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=42.64s)]
*  We have collected over 100 quadrillion biological data and they're applying AI to it to understand [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  exactly what is causing inflammation in your body. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=54.6s)]

*  And since then, he's given birth to three extraordinary kids. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=81.12s)]

*  All right, now on to the episode with Naveen Jain. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  Hey, Naveen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=110.44s)]
*  Good to see you, my friend. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=111.04s)]
*  Peter, it's always such a pleasure to see you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=112.68s)]
*  You know it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=114.48s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=115.2s)]
*  But I've got to start this conversation by saying I turn my back, I close my eyes for [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=115.84s)]
*  a microsecond and your son, Ankur, is on the billionaire's list and he's being married [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=120.8s)]
*  under the pyramid in Egypt. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=127.12s)]
*  I mean, that's pretty awesome. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=129.64s)]
*  You know, I mentored him, what, 15 years ago and the transformation must be mostly all [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=132.44s)]
*  you because what he's done is amazing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=139.4s)]
*  So you must be extraordinarily proud. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=141.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, Peter, as you know, to me, the biggest joys of my life comes watching [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  these children growing up in a great family. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=149.08s)]
*  But more often than not, really learning from you about taking on the audacious challenges [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=153.72s)]
*  and going out and implementing them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=159.32s)]
*  So it's just not that Ankur who's doing it in audacious idea that he took on. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  And our daughter, as you know, Priyanka, and she's running a women's health company. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=166.92s)]
*  And Neel, I mean, you know, he just not only a Schwarzman scholar, he just went on to take [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=173.04s)]
*  on another challenge. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=178.16s)]
*  And, you know, for you and I, nurturing young people for them to find their moonshots and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=179.84s)]
*  help them implement their moonshots. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=187.32s)]
*  Because if any one of our children or anyone else that we talk to succeed, their humanity [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=189.6s)]
*  is better off. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=195.4s)]
*  So it doesn't matter whether it's our children, your children or someone else's children, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=196.08s)]
*  they just benefit humanity. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  So I want to come back to this towards the end of our of our moonshot conversation to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=201.72s)]
*  talk about how do you raise moonshot kids? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=206.08s)]
*  Because you've done an amazing job. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  Mine are 13. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=209.44s)]
*  But before we jump to that, before we jump to our main course of health care and AI, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  what was it like being under the pyramids for that wedding? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  I've never been to the pyramids. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=220.56s)]
*  It's on my next, you know, adventure list. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  Must have been really cool. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=224.56s)]
*  How you arrange to have a pyramid wedding? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  Is that like super hard? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think first of all, you know, it's one of those type of things that you have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=229.6s)]
*  to want to do it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=232.88s)]
*  And as a young kid, uncle went to Egypt and he just fell in love with the idea of these [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  great structures that were built, you know, five thousand seven thousand years ago and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  being married right under the sphinx. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  So they built the custom built structure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=248.12s)]
*  But, you know, to me, honestly, all these things are amazing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=250.44s)]
*  And then, you know, him having an audacious idea of wedding. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=254.0s)]
*  But to me, you know, the fact that he's willing to do what it takes and actually get it [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=257.68s)]
*  done is something that every child should learn. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=263.48s)]
*  And we don't get back to it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  So let's talk about health care and AI for a second and get back to parenting. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=268.6s)]
*  Because there are a lot of things about parenting I really think is very counter [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=273.12s)]
*  intuitive, which is unconventional way of looking at parenting, because most people, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=276.68s)]
*  when they do talk about their children, they think they're trying to do what's right [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=282.6s)]
*  for them. At the end of the day, it turns out to be extremely selfish thing to do at [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=287.16s)]
*  the cost of our actually children growing up to be amazing human beings. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=292.88s)]
*  All right. If you're a parent listening to this, we're going to come back to this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=297.6s)]
*  conversation because I'm a parent and I want to hear and learn from you, buddy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=300.12s)]
*  So let's jump in. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=304.0s)]
*  Naveen, the work you've been doing both in moonshots and in health care as the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  founder, CEO of IOMS, amazing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=310.56s)]
*  And I've often said this, you deserve a medical degree. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=312.96s)]
*  And the amount of knowledge you've soaked up is extraordinary. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=317.16s)]
*  Let me set the table here and give some of the numbers for folks on how really, I [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=320.88s)]
*  don't want to say bad, I want to say awful the U.S. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=327.16s)]
*  health care system is and the challenges that we have. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=329.44s)]
*  So here are the numbers. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=332.08s)]
*  I talk about longevity, escape velocity and blowing through 100. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=333.28s)]
*  But the reality is today, U.S. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  life expectancy has dropped to 76 years and it's the lowest since 1996. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=340.68s)]
*  So it's been going down. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=348.68s)]
*  I think we're going to have some incredible breakthroughs that will drive us towards [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=350.32000000000005s)]
*  longevity, escape velocity. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=354.88s)]
*  U.S. health spend is 18 percent of the GDP, highest ever. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=356.92s)]
*  Obesity rates. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=361.44s)]
*  Right. I mean, listen, I was in Europe and I'm sorry. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  Everyone who was obese there on the average was you could bet they were an American. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, 42 percent of American adults are considered obese. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=374.32s)]
*  It's increased almost 300 percent in the last 30 years. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=377.36s)]
*  And that's driven incredible numbers in diabetes. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. 34 million Americans increased or have diabetes now. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  It's 10 percent of the U.S. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  population, 320 percent increase in 30 years. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=392.04s)]
*  Here's a few more. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=396.24s)]
*  60 percent of American adults have at least one chronic disease and 40 percent have two [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=397.52s)]
*  chronic diseases. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=402.56s)]
*  And then one in five Americans describe having mental illness. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=403.88s)]
*  Last two numbers, the Bloomberg Health Efficiency Index, the U.S. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=410.92s)]
*  ranked 55 out of 57 countries evaluated. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=416.32s)]
*  I mean, it's incredible for 18 percent of our GDP. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=420.56s)]
*  And then the Legatum Prosperity Index ranked us 68th out of 167 countries. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=423.32s)]
*  What in the world is going on? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=431.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, Peter, I mean, chronic diseases is an epidemic that we have to start [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=434.2s)]
*  to solve. You know, most 90 percent plus of our health care dollars are spent on chronic [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=440.52s)]
*  diseases. Fortunately, the chronic diseases are something that we do have a control over [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=446.68s)]
*  as humanity. Unlike genetic diseases, something you're born with, we really don't have much [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=453.96s)]
*  control. And this idea of not taking personal responsibility for our own set of chronic [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=459.96s)]
*  diseases is really what's driving humanity, especially the people in the West. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=466.68s)]
*  Another problem that I see is that our medical industrial complex in the United States, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=472.2s)]
*  everyone in the system makes money when you and I are sick and no one makes money when [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=478.64s)]
*  we are healthy. And I'm not suggesting that these people are evil people, but the incentives [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=484.0s)]
*  are completely misaligned. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=489.44s)]
*  They, you know, whether it is your doctor, whether it's a hospital or even your [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=491.6s)]
*  pharmaceutical company or your insurance company, no one really has any incentive to [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=497.36s)]
*  keep you healthy. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=502.76s)]
*  It's a perverse system. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=503.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's a perverse system. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=505.12s)]
*  And I really think what you are doing, Peter, at Fountain Health or, you know, a Fountain [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=506.76s)]
*  Life is really the right way of doing it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=513.12s)]
*  It's where you say, look, you sign up for a system where you pay a fixed monthly fee. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=515.88s)]
*  And our goal is to keep you healthy because when you are sick, you create more work for [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=521.8s)]
*  us. So incentives are extremely well aligned to say, if I keep you healthy, I get paid [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=527.24s)]
*  and we have less work to do. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=533.16s)]
*  But when you are sick, you're still paying me the same thing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=534.84s)]
*  But now I have so much work to do. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=537.8s)]
*  So you essentially aligning the incentive of the medical care with the person who is [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=539.6s)]
*  actually being cared for. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=545.28s)]
*  That is what's lacking in our current medical industrial complex. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=546.8s)]
*  The second is, you know, people have to take personal responsibility for their action. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=551.16s)]
*  People somehow have been made to believe when they get sick, it's a bad luck. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=557.7199999999999s)]
*  It is something about something they are born with. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=564.5999999999999s)]
*  And yes, there is five or 10 percent of the the diseases that have a genetic [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=567.8s)]
*  implications, but 85 percent to 90 percent of the things are actually something that we [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=575.16s)]
*  can control through our lifestyle. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=580.92s)]
*  And once we understand that we actually have control over them, we can do something about [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=583.48s)]
*  them. And that's the reason at Fountain Life, as you see, when you get people the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=589.64s)]
*  information, you tell them exactly the kind of changes they need to make. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=594.72s)]
*  They see the results. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=599.36s)]
*  We see the same thing exactly at Wyoming. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=601.0s)]
*  We show people what is going on. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=603.6s)]
*  We tell them what to do about it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=605.36s)]
*  And we see the results coming back and saying people's health has actually improved. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=607.16s)]
*  And I think one of the things that you and I would agree on is that chronic inflammation is a [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=612.84s)]
*  root cause of chronic diseases. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  We tend to name them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  And we think if we can name them, we can tame them because that's really good for [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=623.64s)]
*  insurance. We have all these different diseases. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=627.32s)]
*  But the fact is the underlying cause of whether you're looking at diabetes, obesity, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=631.0s)]
*  heart disease and depression or anxiety, it is really is a lot of chronic inflammation [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=637.4s)]
*  in the body. And many of these things can actually be cured through a better lifestyle, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  whether it's a nutrition, meditation or relaxation, exercise, better sleep, finding a [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  true purpose in life. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=656.6s)]
*  I mean, these are the kind of things that are healthy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=657.92s)]
*  I love you for that, buddy. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=659.64s)]
*  I love you for it. You're absolutely right. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=661.52s)]
*  Inflammatory processes that are important. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=663.8s)]
*  Inflammation is an important part of healing in different stages of wounds. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=668.0s)]
*  But it is causing this extraordinary, you know, both on the cardiac, on the digestive, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=672.28s)]
*  on your cognitive side of the equation. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=682.44s)]
*  I've said, you know, listen, one example is sugar is a inflammatory agent and causes [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=684.32s)]
*  chronic disease. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  One of the things that I love about what you've done at Viome is you've brought science [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=692.84s)]
*  and data to what I should and should not eat. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=699.12s)]
*  So when I get my Viome results and I actually look at them to decide, you know, which [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=702.36s)]
*  vegetables are best for me, given my gut microbiome, you know, which meats are best [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=707.68s)]
*  for me and, you know, all of those things. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=714.3599999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, you're just you're going blind. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=717.04s)]
*  And the thing that what we have to realize is not not every not every food is best for [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=720.12s)]
*  for you. And it changes over time depending upon what your gut is like. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=730.16s)]
*  So talk one second a little bit about your discovery of this and how you think about [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=735.2s)]
*  you've been you've been a vegetarian all your life. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=740.16s)]
*  Right. And I've I've gone through keto, vegan, Mediterranean, and I've settled in on a [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=742.68s)]
*  Mediterranean diet. But talk to me about your thoughts on on food, because I do believe a [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=751.36s)]
*  lot of those health care disasters in the U.S. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=757.5999999999999s)]
*  are are fundamentally secondary to what people eat, what people put in their bodies. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=762.04s)]
*  Absolutely. And what people forget is that our human body is essentially is the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=768.3599999999999s)]
*  electrical biochemical body. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=774.1999999999999s)]
*  What we put into our body is actually being changed by a chemical factory called a gut [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=776.28s)]
*  microbiome and an oral microbiome. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=781.8399999999999s)]
*  So essentially, your oral microbiome is pre-processing the food, sending the signals to [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=783.8s)]
*  the brain. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=788.2399999999999s)]
*  And that in turn is actually now getting ready for what is coming. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=789.56s)]
*  And our gut microbiome, the hundred and hundred trillion of these microbes are actually [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=793.0799999999999s)]
*  processing the food, releasing a bunch of biochemicals. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=797.28s)]
*  Right. So imagine that we as humans, less than one percent of all the genes that are [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=800.28s)]
*  expressed in our body come from a mom and dad. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=806.04s)]
*  Ninety nine percent come from all these microbes. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=808.3599999999999s)]
*  And in some sense, we it's not about them and us. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=811.72s)]
*  We are a walking, talking ecosystem. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  And we have to start to think about we as one symbiotic superorganism. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=819.8s)]
*  And this superorganism, what we put in actually matters because based on what we eat, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  our microbes are actually processing them, metabolizing them and releasing the metabolite [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=833.16s)]
*  or call them a micro poop. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=838.4399999999999s)]
*  If you want to call them in simple words, that is what gets absorbed in our blood and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=839.64s)]
*  interaction between our food, what microbes are producing and our immune system is [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=844.88s)]
*  really key to understanding why we have immune diseases. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=851.12s)]
*  Right. So let's start from a very simple fact. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  Human body is like a donut. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=858.84s)]
*  There is a tube that goes through us on top of the tube. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=860.76s)]
*  We have. And by the way, everything is sealed. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=864.4s)]
*  So our body is all around that tube and the tube is nicely supposed to be sealed. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=867.2800000000001s)]
*  Seventy percent of our immune system is along our gut lining because this is really [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=872.6800000000001s)]
*  where the external environment meets the inner body. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=877.72s)]
*  So what's happening really is the food when it comes in, our oral microbiome starts to [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=881.6800000000001s)]
*  pre process the food. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=887.4000000000001s)]
*  And when it sees, as you mentioned, something like sugar, it starts to say, oh, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=889.0400000000001s)]
*  something sweet is coming. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=893.4000000000001s)]
*  It sends a signal for pancreas to start releasing insulin. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=895.12s)]
*  And now the body is ready for sugar. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=899.08s)]
*  Now, the second part that happens is when you eat something sweet, it's not sugar in [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=901.76s)]
*  itself, but sugar gets metabolized by your oral microbiome and it, in fact, changes [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=906.24s)]
*  the acidity of your mouth. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=912.52s)]
*  So not changing the acidity is what causes your tooth decay. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=915.8s)]
*  So it's not the sugar in itself that causes a tooth decay. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=920.12s)]
*  It is the microbes that process sugar, releasing the acid that causes the tooth decay. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=923.6s)]
*  Similarly, when you have that inflammation in your gum, suddenly your barrier to the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=930.4s)]
*  body is broken. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=937.04s)]
*  And now you have the microbes. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  Now they're able when you have a gum inflammation, now microbes are going into the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=939.8s)]
*  blood. Now you have a chronic inflammation because of that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=943.9599999999999s)]
*  And same thing happens in the gut. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=947.52s)]
*  When you have a leaky gut, your microbes are not able to go past the barrier that's [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=949.24s)]
*  supposed to keep them in side check is going into the blood causing chronic inflammation. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  Now, the food that we eat can actually cause inflammation. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=958.5200000000001s)]
*  So based on how the food is actually being metabolized. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  So this idea that Peter, you mentioned, what we learned is there is no such thing as [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=966.48s)]
*  universal healthy food. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=971.6800000000001s)]
*  There is no such thing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=973.76s)]
*  If food is good for you or bad for you. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=975.2800000000001s)]
*  It is simply good for you right now or bad for you right now. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=978.52s)]
*  And something that is good for you doesn't mean it's going to be good for your wife or [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  your friend. So when you hear someone saying, hey, I am eating avocado and I'm really [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=985.76s)]
*  benefiting from it doesn't mean if avocado is a superfood for you. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=991.52s)]
*  So based on your uric acid production, because your avocado increases your uric acid [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  production. So if your uric acid production is already too high, the last thing you want [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1003.12s)]
*  to do is to eat avocado because that's going to cause gout. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1008.0s)]
*  Same thing happens with broccoli. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1012.36s)]
*  So it's not the broccoli is bad or good. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1014.2s)]
*  If you have high sulfide production, then you shouldn't be eating broccoli because it [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1016.88s)]
*  increases the sulfide that's inflammatory. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1021.08s)]
*  And by the way, now I'm not I'm a vegetarian, but I'm not against eating meat. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1024.04s)]
*  So red meat contains choline and carnitine. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1028.56s)]
*  And when that gets processed by your microbes, they actually can convert that into TMA, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1032.8s)]
*  trimethylamine, which actually gets absorbed in the blood and your liver converts them [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1038.24s)]
*  into TMAO, trimethylamine oxide. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1043.8s)]
*  That is what causes the heart disease. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1047.0s)]
*  So if your microbes are not producing enough TMA, you should eat red meat. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1049.92s)]
*  It has a lot of nutrition in your body. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1054.92s)]
*  So it's not the red meat that's good or bad. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1057.04s)]
*  It is good or bad based on are you producing a lot of TMA or not enough TMA. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1059.72s)]
*  Right. So. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1064.68s)]
*  Yeah. So, buddy, I think this is this is, you know, critically important for folks to [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1065.96s)]
*  realize it's, you know, when I do I don't want to I don't want to over overstress on [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1071.2s)]
*  biome, but it's the only product I know right now that gives me feedback on which given [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1077.8s)]
*  the AI systems that you've built, which foods are appropriate given my oral and gut [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1083.8s)]
*  microbiome and the changes over time. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1089.6s)]
*  Right. So I've gotten a incredible increased respect for oral health and gut health [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1091.56s)]
*  because at the end of the day, it can make you or break you. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1099.24s)]
*  And I had a tooth infection secondary. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1103.76s)]
*  I'll go into it. But that drove me to have to do an antibiotic course. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1107.32s)]
*  I tried to avoid the antibiotics, but at the end of the day, antibiotics are what allowed [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1112.48s)]
*  us to double our lifespan in the last 40 years or 50. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1117.96s)]
*  And I ended up taking it and it changed my microbiome. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1121.76s)]
*  And I have to check again and make sure that I am properly repopulating my microbiome. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1124.5600000000002s)]
*  So how often does it all change? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1130.0800000000002s)]
*  How often how quickly do you see different, you know, food recommendations coming out [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1133.64s)]
*  of the system? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1139.5600000000002s)]
*  So it's very interesting, Peter. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1141.3999999999999s)]
*  We actually looked at the people doing the test every day, every week, every month. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1143.1599999999999s)]
*  And we saw that actually your microbes change in four to six months. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1148.72s)]
*  And that's the reason we tell people to retest every four to six months, because the food [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1152.76s)]
*  that used to be good for you may no longer be good for you because your microbes have [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1157.4399999999998s)]
*  completely changed because you travel, you're taking antibiotics course and food that [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1161.32s)]
*  you're eating. So when you're traveling, you're eating a very different types of food. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1166.1599999999999s)]
*  And over time, these things all have an impact. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1169.32s)]
*  Are you spending enough time in the forest near the trees? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1172.8s)]
*  Because all the trees, all the stuff that we are around, all the breathing, living, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1177.76s)]
*  breathing and changing our microbiome constantly. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1182.76s)]
*  And then we can, in fact, look at this stuff and we can talk a little bit more about that [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1185.6399999999999s)]
*  in terms of longevity. What have we found? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1189.76s)]
*  So, Peter, one of the interesting that you mentioned in the beginning is that it is a [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1192.1999999999998s)]
*  massive amount of data that we have collected that's allowing us to constantly [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1195.84s)]
*  actually change our recommendation. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1200.6s)]
*  We have now analyzed close to one million samples. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1203.3999999999999s)]
*  We have collected over one hundred quadrillion biological data [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1208.12s)]
*  points. Right. And then applying AI to it to understand exactly what is causing [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1213.2s)]
*  inflammation in your body. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1219.56s)]
*  So what we do is we analyze your oral microbiome through saliva. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1221.36s)]
*  We analyze your gut microbiome through stool. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1225.08s)]
*  And then we take a finger prick blood. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1227.36s)]
*  And in the blood, we are looking at all of your cellular health. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1229.3999999999999s)]
*  And that means we're looking at all of your interleukins, which are cytokines, to see [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1232.48s)]
*  what are the actually pro-inflammatory biomarkers, what are the anti-inflammatory [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1236.9199999999998s)]
*  biomarkers. We are looking at all of the gene expression from your mitochondria. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1241.6s)]
*  And most people forget that mitochondria has its own genes. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1246.6399999999999s)]
*  So in a sense, understanding how your mitochondria is actually being impacted by [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1251.32s)]
*  the foods we eat, how our inflammation is being impacted by the things we are doing [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1256.44s)]
*  and then taking all of that into account. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1261.52s)]
*  Then we come back with the recommendations. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1264.08s)]
*  But I want to focus on why I'm I want to just simply focus on human body and the [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1266.2s)]
*  human health as such. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1270.6s)]
*  So let's talk about I want to dive in. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1272.3999999999999s)]
*  I've listed seven ways that I think AI is going to reinvent health care. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1274.48s)]
*  Let me let me list these off and then I want to talk to you about them. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1279.24s)]
*  So the first is I think we're all going to have an AI health coach that is some [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1282.6s)]
*  version of Jarvis that is monitoring our body 24 7. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1288.08s)]
*  It's listening to our voice, the tenor of our cough, how we type and walk. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1293.6399999999999s)]
*  If you have augmented reality glasses, it's looking at the food you're eating and [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1299.12s)]
*  that health coach is going to suggest to you eat this, not that. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1303.12s)]
*  It's going to suggest to you you've got 30 minutes open in your calendar. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1309.28s)]
*  It's 75 degrees and sunny outside. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1312.9199999999998s)]
*  Go out for a walk. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1315.12s)]
*  It will say instead of taking the escalators, there's a staircase around the [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1316.3999999999999s)]
*  corner, take the stairs. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1319.36s)]
*  So I think we're going to see health coaches coming online and you can turn it off [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1320.8s)]
*  if it's annoying for you. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1326.56s)]
*  But that's one area. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1328.1599999999999s)]
*  The second is these health coaches are going to be then connected to your wearables [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1330.24s)]
*  and implantable. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1335.32s)]
*  So I've got a, you know, I'm wearing a continuous glucose monitor. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1335.96s)]
*  I've got my or a ring, my Apple watch, but, you know, bold capital, my fund, which [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1340.3200000000002s)]
*  which, you know, isn't all full disclosure and investor in Viome. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1346.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, we've invested a number of wearables and implantable devices, and I [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1351.64s)]
*  think these are going to give you continuous. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1356.0s)]
*  Right now you go for a full body upload and fountain once a year and then [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1358.96s)]
*  quarterly testing. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1363.04s)]
*  But this is going to be continuous testing, measuring what's going on. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1364.52s)]
*  Ultimately, I imagine that what's going on in your blood biochemistry is going to [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1369.08s)]
*  be delivered to your robot chef in the kitchen that will prepare the food that [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1374.24s)]
*  you need in that moment versus that you think you need in that moment. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1378.72s)]
*  Um, I think we're going to see, and you're doing this right now, uh, you know, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1383.2s)]
*  AI analyzing the, you know, the billions, as you've done quadrillions of biomarker [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1387.8400000000001s)]
*  data points, uh, there's no way any human can do that. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1395.3600000000001s)]
*  Um, one of my favorite ones is, uh, we've seen at deep mind, AlphaFold three, an [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1399.0s)]
*  AI model that can model the interaction of all molecules of life, like this [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1406.5600000000002s)]
*  protein, this Kyber, you know, carbohydrate, this RNA molecule, how do [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1411.72s)]
*  they interact with each other and where that's going to go is an AI model that [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1416.4s)]
*  is modeling your cell for your DNA, the billion chemical reactions per second. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1421.4s)]
*  We're going to see AI, uh, doing image analysis on our, you know, MRIs and X-rays [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1428.0s)]
*  and CTs, right? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1434.8000000000002s)]
*  And then customized meds and supplements. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1436.0800000000002s)]
*  Again, something Viome is doing in part right now, but I want to know there is a [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1438.88s)]
*  very best set of meds and supplements for me, given my genetics, given my blood [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1444.32s)]
*  biomarkers, given my objectives, given how many pills I'm going to take per day. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1449.8799999999999s)]
*  So I want an AI model. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1456.32s)]
*  It's going to give me that very specific formulation. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1457.8s)]
*  And then the final thing I listed here was, uh, robot surgeons. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1461.48s)]
*  I think that the best surgeons in the world eventually will be robots driven by AI [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1465.36s)]
*  models that demonetize and democratize access to medicine. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1470.4s)]
*  So that's my list. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1475.3200000000002s)]
*  Um, talk to me what your thoughts are AI and healthcare. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1477.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think one big one that you missed out that I think we all both [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1481.44s)]
*  know is going to happen. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1484.44s)]
*  It may not be now, but in 10 years or 15 from now, 15 years from now is going to be [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1485.1200000000001s)]
*  nanobots. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1489.4s)]
*  And so essentially a lot of the information that is going to come from inside the body [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1490.3200000000002s)]
*  communicating with outside, they're going to be repairing our own organs. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1495.4s)]
*  They're going to be constantly supplying the nutrients where it's needed. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1499.8s)]
*  So as opposed to simply relying on our primitive blood system to figure out, to [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1503.48s)]
*  make sure that things are going where they need to go, we actually can have now [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1508.6s)]
*  intelligent and nanobots that are going to take their nutrients, taking it to the [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1512.28s)]
*  right place where it is needed, taking the stem cells in the right place to repair [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1516.12s)]
*  the right organ. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1519.8799999999999s)]
*  So all of that is going to happen. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1520.6399999999999s)]
*  But let's just in the near future, we have the data that we need and yes, it is [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1522.24s)]
*  probably not as easy and not as continuous. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1528.0s)]
*  But the fact things like what fountain life is doing is to getting that information [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1531.68s)]
*  today. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1536.56s)]
*  And yes, it is crude. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1537.24s)]
*  Yes, we have to actually puncture our way to draw the blood. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1538.88s)]
*  And some day our kids and grandkids are look at this stuff and say, how cruel that [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1542.72s)]
*  you are actually breaking your way to draw the blood. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1547.28s)]
*  How could it's like having the leeches on your body? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1550.24s)]
*  How could you possibly could have done that? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1553.4s)]
*  How primitive of you guys to be doing it? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1555.44s)]
*  But until then, the fact that we are able to take these samples from our body, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1557.76s)]
*  analyze them regularly, whether it's every three months, four months or six months, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1563.76s)]
*  getting that data, using the massive amount of AI and personalizing everything [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1568.36s)]
*  for each individual, whether it is in nutrition and nutrition means all the [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1574.28s)]
*  supplements and everything. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1579.48s)]
*  And Peter, you mentioned today we are the only company that looks at this stuff at [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1580.64s)]
*  Bio, tells you you need 22 milligram of amylase, you need 79 milligram of [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1585.44s)]
*  elderberry, you need 27 milligram of lycopene. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1590.3600000000001s)]
*  And we actually make that powder only with those ingredients in that dosage and [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1593.96s)]
*  put them in a capsule and ship it to you every single month. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1599.88s)]
*  And as your body changes, we change the whole nutrition profile for you. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1603.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1606.8s)]
*  You know, I put out a blog recently, Naveen, that I'm doing 75 pills a day. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1607.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1612.0800000000002s)]
*  I've been measuring everything. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1612.52s)]
*  The experiment I'm going to run and I'll just state it on here is I'm at I have my [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1614.68s)]
*  next Fountain Life upload at the end of this month and I'll take all of my data in. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1621.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1626.6000000000001s)]
*  And what I'm going to do right after that upload is I'm going to stop the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1626.76s)]
*  supplements I'm currently taking and I'm going to take the biome supplements and [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1632.48s)]
*  and see how that impacts me. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1638.68s)]
*  You know, the only way we can do this is run these experiments. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1640.68s)]
*  And so I'm going to run that experiment and see from a I mean, I feel an amazing [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1644.24s)]
*  shape and I feel cognitive alert. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  But, you know, maybe I can feel better. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1652.3600000000001s)]
*  But I'm also thinking, Peter, we don't know what better is until we get there. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1654.1200000000001s)]
*  OK, as you know, we used to do supplements and we used to do these, you know, these [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1661.52s)]
*  biotics and we had my personalized supplement. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1665.28s)]
*  And now you may or may not realize we actually just launched for your oral [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1668.3600000000001s)]
*  health, your oral lozenges. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1672.04s)]
*  So please send me that. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1673.76s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1675.16s)]
*  And here's the best one. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1676.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1677.8799999999999s)]
*  Personalized toothpaste for you. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1678.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1680.24s)]
*  AM and PM. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1680.68s)]
*  So morning and afternoon. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1681.84s)]
*  Listen, my morning health routine, you know, I published a blog on that, you [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1683.16s)]
*  know, what my morning routine is like. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1688.64s)]
*  It's I have gained so much respect for oral health because it drives cognitive [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1691.12s)]
*  health and cardiac health in such a powerful fashion. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1699.0s)]
*  And the cancer, by the way, cancer and many other including preterm birth and many [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1702.84s)]
*  other diseases that are driven by oral health. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1707.9199999999998s)]
*  So I'm going to run my end of one experiment here. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1710.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1713.24s)]
*  So you've got you've got you've got you've got experiments going on with hundreds of [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1713.96s)]
*  thousands of people who are your customers. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1717.52s)]
*  But I'm going to do that. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1719.2s)]
*  I'm publicly announcing that. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1720.76s)]
*  And it's just I need to know. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1722.1599999999999s)]
*  And then I'll you know, I'll still keep on the meds I'm on, you know, so this is a [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1724.6399999999999s)]
*  single use AM and PM. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1729.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1731.52s)]
*  So if you can see here in the morning AM, it is designed to remove the plaque on [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1731.8s)]
*  contact and in the evening one, it completely repopulates and readjusts your [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1737.36s)]
*  auto microbiome. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1742.52s)]
*  So I think you're going to absolutely enjoy this. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1743.36s)]
*  Just got launched last week, by the way. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1745.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1747.04s)]
*  I'll send you my address. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1747.32s)]
*  You have my address. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1748.28s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1749.52s)]
*  I do. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1749.96s)]
*  So Peter, coming back to it and the AI. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1750.48s)]
*  So AI is going to be the biggest breakthrough for the hour. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1752.6399999999999s)]
*  If I were to guess the two biggest changes that are going to happen in humanity [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1757.12s)]
*  because of AI is going to be in education and health care. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1762.0s)]
*  Education is going to completely change the way we have ever looked at education. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1766.6799999999998s)]
*  For the first time, we have a shot at making the education personalized to each [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1771.32s)]
*  individual, how they learn and really making it very immersive and making it add [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1777.56s)]
*  challenging and really using AI as a tutor rather than simply to give you the [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1782.72s)]
*  answer to actually challenge you how to think about a problem. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1787.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1790.8s)]
*  So that is one big thing that's going on. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1791.2s)]
*  Like your grandmother used to do. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1792.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1794.8s)]
*  And we'll talk about that. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1796.6000000000001s)]
*  We'll talk about that later. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1797.4s)]
*  In health care, I think both of these systems, education and health care, are so [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1798.88s)]
*  massively broken. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1804.72s)]
*  The amount of money. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1807.0s)]
*  So massively obsolete. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1807.96s)]
*  They're really not broken, but they're obsolete. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1809.2s)]
*  They're doing what they were designed to do in a sense that our education system [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1812.92s)]
*  was designed for industrial ages where they were supposed to teach skills and [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1816.6000000000001s)]
*  their skills could be used for the rest of your life. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1820.28s)]
*  And now we're living in the times where whatever you learn becomes obsolete. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1822.28s)]
*  So the idea of learning to learn that our needs today are very different than the [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1825.88s)]
*  needs of 50 years ago. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1830.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's a fundamental thing is our health care system was designed when we [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1832.6000000000001s)]
*  were dying from infectious diseases and acute care. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1836.72s)]
*  And our health care system delivers that really well. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1839.56s)]
*  If you have an acute condition, that is really what's designed for. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1842.72s)]
*  It's not designed for these chronic conditions. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1846.48s)]
*  And let's not forget the fact that we made incredible progress, but I'm still [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1848.76s)]
*  the health care per unit dollar in the United States is failing. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1858.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1862.9199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1863.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1864.6s)]
*  And it's just the bureaucracy. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1865.28s)]
*  I mean, I went to medical school and I opted out of medicine and I'm so happy I [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1867.12s)]
*  did because it's all paperwork and insurance and it's just a baroque. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1873.76s)]
*  People are paying so much. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1881.0s)]
*  Peter, think about it. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1883.48s)]
*  We as a company paying for every employee thousand dollars a month. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1884.6s)]
*  Wouldn't that be better to give a thousand dollars a month for a system like [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1888.6399999999999s)]
*  Fountain Life, where you pay a thousand dollars a month and someone is out there [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1893.72s)]
*  to take care of you to make sure you don't fall sick, a thousand dollars a month, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1898.0s)]
*  you know, to wait until you get sick. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1903.2s)]
*  And when I go to a doctor and if I tell them I'm pre-diabetes, they look at me [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1905.28s)]
*  it's like, and what's the problem? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1910.68s)]
*  Wait until you have diabetes and come talk to me. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1912.3600000000001s)]
*  Their answer is take these drugs. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1915.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, that, by the way, if you're lucky, if you're lucky, because they say you're [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1917.2s)]
*  not diabetic yet. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1921.3600000000001s)]
*  So wait until before I can give you a drug. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1923.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1925.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1926.24s)]
*  It's like, it's like, okay, you've got the chronic disease. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1926.6s)]
*  We're not going to try and cure the chronic disease. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1928.8799999999999s)]
*  We're just going to reduce the symptoms of the chronic disease. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1930.3999999999999s)]
*  It's still going to be there. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1932.76s)]
*  You're still going to get it sicker and sicker and all the secondary and tertiary [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1934.04s)]
*  effects are still going to happen. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1936.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=1938.28s)]

*  A lot of the pieces are starting to come together already now, but they're not [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2249.76s)]
*  integrated in the next 18 months to 24 months. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2254.64s)]

*  You won't be able to do what you're doing if you keep doing this. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2279.32s)]
*  And you don't know. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2281.92s)]
*  Honestly, very few of us actually know what's going on inside our bodies. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2282.92s)]
*  We're all optimists, right? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2287.12s)]
*  And you're all you're doing what feels good in the moment and hoping it's good for [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2288.7200000000003s)]
*  you. You know, I just got back from India. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2292.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I saw your home. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2295.4s)]
*  It was it was an amazing trip, right? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2298.04s)]
*  I was in Bangalore for two days and in Delhi for two days and by for two days and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2300.04s)]
*  met with some I had a chance to meet with Ratan Tata, who's been a friend of ours on [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2306.0s)]
*  our board at XPRIZE and Chandra, the CEO now of the Tata Group, Mukesh and all that. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2310.64s)]
*  And it's clear to me that AI for you know, it's a nation of one point four billion [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2316.64s)]
*  people. Average income per person, twenty four hundred dollars, right? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2322.12s)]
*  Compared to the US at fifty thousand, China, eighty five hundred. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2326.92s)]
*  The only way India thrives and India has so much potential is AI [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2330.7200000000003s)]
*  apps focus on health care and education. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2337.48s)]
*  So, Peter, one of the interesting things about India, and I really think this may be [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2340.76s)]
*  that biggest advantage that India has. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2344.7200000000003s)]
*  So remember, India has a better mobile system, a cellular system than we have in [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2347.7599999999998s)]
*  US. Amazing, amazing. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2352.16s)]
*  And you know why? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2354.08s)]
*  Because we had for so long the wireline system and there was so much baggage that [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2355.36s)]
*  we had. So people who did not have wireline system completely jumped into the [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2360.8399999999997s)]
*  actual LTE. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2366.04s)]
*  So they were there first ones to implement the system that we didn't have in US. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2367.2799999999997s)]
*  And same thing is going to happen, by the way, there the education system is now [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2371.36s)]
*  going to be completely driven by AI because there's so much need for it and [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2375.6s)]
*  there is not as much baggage because Harvard and Stanford, the world are not [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2379.8399999999997s)]
*  going to let that happen. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2383.72s)]
*  Right. Same thing is going to happen in health care. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2384.7599999999998s)]
*  There's one point four billion people who need health care and the health they [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2387.2799999999997s)]
*  don't have a medical industrial complex. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2391.12s)]
*  They have a national health care system. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2393.36s)]
*  And that means they will be able to implement health care using AI for everyone. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2395.56s)]
*  And they're going to, in fact, have so much data that they're going to surpass US [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2400.16s)]
*  and someday we're going to go to India or use the technology developed in India to [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2405.52s)]
*  actually help us in US because it's so difficult to do. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2410.1200000000003s)]
*  I agree with you. Geo, which is their 5G network that Mukesh Ambani built. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2413.44s)]
*  And by the way, I'm really happy Mukesh has agreed to come on the Moonshots [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2418.88s)]
*  podcast and talk about his vision. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2422.2000000000003s)]

*  Incredible. I mean, they were the 14th mobile phone company to enter India and [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2426.52s)]
*  now they're the dominant player and much better cell service than the United [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2431.32s)]
*  States. Crazy, crazy, crazy. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2435.92s)]
*  Anyway, I think we are the beautiful thing about health care and AI is [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2438.0800000000004s)]
*  breakthroughs that are valid in India are valid in the Bronx, invalid in Detroit, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2444.56s)]
*  because we all have the same the same biology. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2451.44s)]
*  And we're going to just the same way that Google is the same for Larry Page's kids [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2454.4s)]
*  and the poorest child in India. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2459.48s)]
*  AI driven health care systems, which are democratized and demonetized, will be [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2461.88s)]
*  equally valid. So excited. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2466.28s)]
*  That's very interesting is Peter that, you know, our genetics may be different. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2468.28s)]
*  Even our microbiome people in India may be different than in US. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2472.04s)]
*  But what we learned, Peter, this is something that I never shared with you. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2475.96s)]
*  We did the study in Japan and US. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2479.52s)]
*  And what we saw was they had very different genetics and they also had a very [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2482.16s)]
*  different microbiome. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2486.7599999999998s)]
*  But the functionality of microbiome, that RNA that microbiomes were producing to [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2488.2s)]
*  produce the functions to stay healthy, were same. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2493.0s)]
*  There was 90 percent similarity in the functions that they were providing and [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2495.7999999999997s)]
*  less than 10 percent similarity, in fact, in the organism or the composition of [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2500.04s)]
*  the microbiome. So I'm one of the things I'm tracking right now is the data [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2504.68s)]
*  acquisition tech. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2510.8799999999997s)]
*  So wearables, right? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2512.2s)]
*  So I've got my my levels, CGM on my my or ring, my Apple watch. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2513.7599999999998s)]
*  But there are companies that I've been investing in through bold that are, you [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2519.7599999999998s)]
*  know, subdermal long term that can measure a number of different of [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2525.48s)]
*  molecules. And I think we're going to get to a point where we're monitoring our [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2532.04s)]
*  biochemistry 24 7. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2535.52s)]
*  Yeah. Right. What do you what are you tracking and seeing in that area? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2538.2s)]
*  So I think there are a lot of companies that are trying to build these arrays [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2542.5200000000004s)]
*  that can monitor 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 things in a single single ELISA assay. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2546.8s)]
*  And that is really the kind of thing you need to do that. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2553.4s)]
*  Now you just need to miniaturize that enough to be able to actually put them on [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2555.88s)]
*  skin to be able to get, you know, just a serum or a fluid to be able to analyze [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2560.5600000000004s)]
*  everything. It is going to happen. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2564.92s)]
*  But I suspect given in U.S., the FDA, anytime you have to do anything in U.S., [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2566.72s)]
*  it takes so long. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2573.96s)]
*  So my suspicion is, unfortunately, many of these tax will come out of India and [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2575.72s)]
*  other countries because it's so much easier to implement and test these ideas. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2581.7599999999998s)]
*  And U.S. makes it extremely difficult to test these ideas. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2587.04s)]
*  No, I hear you. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2590.6s)]
*  And and hopefully you'll be able to travel to where you need to to get the [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2593.2s)]
*  get the technology. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2598.72s)]
*  I mean, you travel to Costa Rica and other places to get stem cells because we know [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2600.36s)]
*  it is something works. But in U.S., it is so difficult to get approval to do [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2605.08s)]
*  anything. And people, especially people, members of Fountain Life, you take them [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2609.32s)]
*  to the places where they can actually benefit from it. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2614.0s)]
*  You know, once you've got the data, once you have all of these systems reporting [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2616.52s)]
*  into your health, a right, which is monitoring you 24 7, it's got all of your [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2621.92s)]
*  all of your data and it's constantly gathering health data. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2627.68s)]
*  It's ability to analyze billions of billions of data points per day from you [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2633.08s)]
*  and then flag red flags of, you know, need to get you to do these greater tests. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2639.28s)]
*  So I think that's here now. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2646.84s)]
*  It's just we do it episodically, right? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2649.1200000000003s)]
*  We do it with a biome test every three months or Fountain Life upload on a [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2651.2000000000003s)]
*  quarterly basis. But it's going to become continuous. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2656.28s)]
*  And I think that's when and I think one of the things that's going to happen is [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2659.44s)]
*  where we can really impact the U.S. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2664.2s)]
*  health care system is when it's cheaper for me as an employee, as an employer, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2666.08s)]
*  to make sure that I give you these wearables and implantables for free and [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2672.96s)]
*  turn on your health A.I. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2679.36s)]
*  because given that I can find disease at inception and prevent you from getting [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2681.84s)]
*  sick and optimize your health because a healthier employee employee for me is a [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2687.88s)]
*  better employee. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2692.88s)]
*  So we do that for our employees. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2694.6s)]
*  We give them 75 percent discount. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2696.6800000000003s)]
*  We don't give them 100 percent. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2698.36s)]
*  The reason is because we want people to actually take some responsibility. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2699.4s)]
*  Otherwise, people just don't get stuff for free. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2703.2000000000003s)]
*  You don't value it. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2705.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2705.96s)]
*  So we give them 75 percent discount on everything that wine does that test every [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2706.8s)]
*  time you want to do a test every three months, all the supplements, your toothpaste, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2710.84s)]
*  everything. Right. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2715.2000000000003s)]
*  Our goal really is that it's not a cost because we absolutely believe it's going [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2716.2400000000002s)]
*  to reduce our insurance costs. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2720.8s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2722.4s)]
*  So we are now doing it for a whole bunch of other employers where we say, look, by [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2722.8s)]
*  offering it, you're actually going to reduce your insurance costs and make people [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2726.6800000000003s)]
*  more productive. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2730.6800000000003s)]
*  Less less absent is more happy, less depression, less anxiety. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2731.8s)]
*  And we publish these data. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2736.84s)]
*  I think we shared with you in the last time, I think, especially in one of the [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2738.2000000000003s)]
*  emails that when we publish the data that by simply doing these tests and taking [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2741.44s)]
*  these personalized nutrition, your IBS symptoms were down by 48 percent. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2746.36s)]
*  Your depression down by 47 percent. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2752.0s)]
*  Anxiety clinical score by 42 percent. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2754.44s)]
*  Diabetes HBA once you down by 30 percent. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2757.28s)]
*  These are the kind of results from food and supplements. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2760.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, these are mind boggling results. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2763.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2765.6800000000003s)]
*  And there's I mean, listen, there's going to be a mental component to that if I'm [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2766.7200000000003s)]
*  taking care of myself, I think better of myself. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2770.32s)]
*  All of this is self supportive. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2773.32s)]
*  And I'll you know, I'll quote a study I wrote about in my line, my last longevity [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2776.36s)]
*  book, which was that optimists live 15 percent longer. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2781.08s)]
*  Right. So if you're optimistic about your health, you're optimistic about the world, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2785.88s)]
*  it puts you into a very positive feedback loop. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2790.16s)]
*  And there is very much a mind body connection there. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2792.48s)]
*  And Peter, so I think I'm going to just give you a little bit on what we actually [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2795.72s)]
*  found. There were five things we found that people need to stay longer and [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2800.04s)]
*  healthier. Number one, we have, I think, discussed nutrition because without the [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2804.6s)]
*  proper fuel in the body, nothing matters. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2809.2s)]
*  Right. So that's the number one thing is to make sure you have a proper fuel in the [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2811.56s)]
*  body. The second thing is reducing stress. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2815.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. So the thing is, when you are stressed, your body goes into fight or flight [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2818.64s)]
*  response. And unfortunately, the way we evolve when you're in fight or flight [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2822.52s)]
*  response is because we were being chased by the tiger. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2827.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. So that means your body shuts down what it considers non-essential things [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2829.96s)]
*  such as your digestive system. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2834.64s)]
*  Yeah. Can I add a couple of points here? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2837.08s)]
*  It's really important. Yeah. So number one, just a small don't eat your dinner [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2839.28s)]
*  while watching the evening news. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2844.8s)]
*  Okay. Just don't do it. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2847.32s)]
*  You know, Helen Messier, who you know well and I do, has worked for both of us. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2849.32s)]
*  Yeah. You know, she says vitamin O, take some deep breaths, meditative, put [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2855.12s)]
*  yourself into rest and digest mode, your parasympathetic nervous system. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2860.12s)]
*  This is why people do thankfulness or prayers at the beginning of the meal. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2864.52s)]
*  Right. So slow it down, rest and digest. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2869.2000000000003s)]
*  The second thing is we've got a lot of entrepreneurs who are watching the [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2872.92s)]
*  Moonshots podcast here. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2876.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And just one of the things I was just hearing Jeff Bezos speak about this, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2877.6400000000003s)]
*  that if you are stressed, it's typically because you have something going on that [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2883.0800000000004s)]
*  you're not taking action about. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2891.68s)]
*  And your stress is a result of you know it's there, you know you're going to have [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2893.8799999999997s)]
*  to do something, but as soon as you take even an action of acknowledging it to the [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2899.0s)]
*  other person or setting up a phone call or doing something that's going to move you [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2905.0s)]
*  towards solution, it will functionally reduce your stress levels. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2909.64s)]
*  It's that you know it's there, you're not doing anything about it that's causing [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2914.12s)]
*  stress. So if you're stressed about something, make your list, take some [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2916.6s)]
*  actions and move it forward. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2920.48s)]
*  Or actually Peter, I would say I describe any time there are problems, I describe [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2922.6s)]
*  them, there are two types of problems. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2926.56s)]
*  So problems that you have a control over and the problems you have absolutely no [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2927.76s)]
*  control over. Right. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2931.32s)]
*  So hurricane is going to come. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2932.28s)]
*  I can be stressed all I want. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2933.6s)]
*  There's nothing I can do about it. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2934.92s)]
*  Right. So the point is when you don't have a control over something, to me, I go [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2936.08s)]
*  back to my Eastern philosophy. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2940.64s)]
*  It is what it is and it will be what will be. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2942.36s)]
*  And I really at that point I say I'm comfortable with whatever the outcome is. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2944.76s)]
*  I'm going to do the best I can. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2948.64s)]
*  If the things are in my control, I do everything I possibly can. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2950.28s)]
*  And then it is what it is and it will be what will be. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2953.76s)]
*  Right. So that to me is the main thing is, is to never really worry about things [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2955.92s)]
*  that you have no control over. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2961.7200000000003s)]
*  And the things you do have a control over as you say, take some action. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2963.56s)]
*  Because the minute you take action, now you're moving towards a solution that [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2967.8s)]
*  you have a control over. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2972.0s)]
*  All right. You were listing five things. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2973.28s)]
*  We got to number two. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2975.04s)]
*  The third was Peter, that is exercise. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2975.76s)]
*  And again, I think this is something that only in exercise people have this idea. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2978.0s)]
*  You have to spend seven, eight hours, four hours in the gym. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2982.0s)]
*  That is wrong. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2984.8s)]
*  What you have to do is get body to move and do some muscle strength. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2985.92s)]
*  Right. So as we are aging, making sure we're doing some strength training at [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2989.84s)]
*  least two to three times a week and but making sure you're doing a fast walk at [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2994.32s)]
*  least four or five miles every single day. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=2999.84s)]
*  And that's really is in terms of exercise. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3002.88s)]
*  It is making sure you move. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3005.5200000000004s)]
*  You're not sitting as Peter you say sitting is new smoking. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3007.48s)]
*  Move. Even if nothing else, get on the damn treadmill at two miles an hour. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3011.12s)]
*  Just keep moving. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3014.64s)]
*  Get your lymphatic system working. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3015.64s)]
*  Get your body to start getting the oxygen going. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3017.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3020.68s)]
*  You know, I on the exercise front, I just, you know, I've shifted. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3021.96s)]
*  I used to do a really intensive hour three times a week. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3027.12s)]
*  I've shifted it now to probably what's 40 minutes, five times a week, six, if I [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3033.04s)]
*  can get it and and I, I found it really transformational in terms of maintaining [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3039.36s)]
*  and building muscle mass, the frequency of this. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3046.48s)]
*  And as I just had a friend of mine, an abundance member who had a very bad [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3050.52s)]
*  pulmonary situation ended up in the hospital on a ventilator, but he was so [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3056.16s)]
*  someone who had built significant muscle mass and his recovery was directly a [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3062.68s)]
*  function of that. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3068.16s)]
*  And so he's since he's been out, he's been able to add 90% of it back. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3068.96s)]
*  I mean, muscle mass is your is your reserve for being able to to battle [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3073.7599999999998s)]
*  chronic situations or acute situations. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3079.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3082.32s)]
*  And the fourth thing I think we can most people don't realize as much as sleep. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3083.16s)]
*  The quality of sleep matters, not just the quantity, but the quality of sleep [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3087.4s)]
*  matters. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3092.7999999999997s)]
*  So I think you and I both measure our sleep through our ring. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3093.48s)]
*  I also use Peter eight sleep matters. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3097.08s)]
*  I have our ring and each sleep as well. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3100.56s)]
*  So, and I think that changes the temperature as I go to sleep and I [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3102.88s)]
*  monitor our sleep because to us is important. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3105.56s)]
*  We get our own half to two hours of REM sleep and we get at least our two hour [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3108.64s)]
*  and a half of deep sleep. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3112.96s)]
*  It is really, really important. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3114.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3116.2s)]
*  And I think, you know, I think you and I both earlier in our lives used to be [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3116.7599999999998s)]
*  proud of how little we would, you know, I'm in medical school. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3122.3999999999996s)]
*  It was like, OK, I can get through five hours of sleep. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3126.48s)]
*  That was like my, you know, I'll sleep when I'm dead was a mantra. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3128.8799999999997s)]
*  And that's just absolutely wrong. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3132.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3133.8799999999997s)]
*  And I think Peter, what I think what I've realized is now I go to bed early. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3134.7999999999997s)]
*  So the couple of things in sleep that I think I go to bed by night. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3137.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3141.9199999999996s)]
*  And nine, nine thirty for me. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3142.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3143.7999999999997s)]
*  What time do you wake up? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3144.2s)]
*  About between four and four, between four and five. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3145.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3148.52s)]
*  Do you think your morning hours are your most productive? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3149.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3152.48s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3152.96s)]
*  I mean, I think by the way, there's a lot of research Peter in the early sunrise, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3153.84s)]
*  the wavelength of the sunrise and the angle of sunrise actually resetting your [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3157.84s)]
*  circadian rhythm and there's so much research on how early morning sunrise and [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3162.12s)]
*  doing a sun salutation in the morning really, really helps your body get back. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3166.88s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3170.6800000000003s)]
*  And I just, you know, I've been trying to wake up where I have been waking up on [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3171.76s)]
*  my own at five a.m., especially coming back from India. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3176.48s)]
*  And I love it. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3179.5600000000004s)]
*  Those first those first three hours the morning from five to eight are mine. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3181.5600000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3187.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3187.5200000000004s)]
*  I get my writing done, working on my books. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3187.84s)]
*  I get, you know, I do my red light therapy, a meditation, and then I'm in the gym. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3191.32s)]
*  And I do a lot of research people, research papers I read in the morning. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3196.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, this is a perfect time for me to before anybody else wakes up. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3199.7599999999998s)]
*  This is our time to do the thing that we need to do. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3202.7599999999998s)]
*  Very selfish. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3205.0s)]
*  Self care. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3207.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3207.7999999999997s)]
*  So Peter, that's and I think the sleep is just as important as anything else, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3209.52s)]
*  because in fact, Matthew Walker and many people will tell you that, you know, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3213.56s)]
*  correlation between poor sleep and many of the chronic diseases is a lot. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3217.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, so I think really reducing inflammation, getting your brain active, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3222.24s)]
*  I think sleep is. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3225.8799999999997s)]
*  And the last one, Peter, is is purpose. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3227.0s)]
*  And I think you know, I think you call that optimism, but I think finding a purpose [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3230.12s)]
*  in life is really so important because people who live a life of purpose, they [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3234.72s)]
*  tend to be obviously optimist, but really living a life of purpose, you tend to live [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3239.72s)]
*  10 to 15 years longer when you have a purpose in life than you people who don't [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3244.12s)]
*  have a purpose in life. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3248.2799999999997s)]
*  I hundred percent. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3249.12s)]
*  Hundred percent. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3250.44s)]
*  And this is something I learned a lot from you that, you know, we have talked [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3251.3999999999996s)]
*  about it. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3256.56s)]
*  Find something that you're willing to die for and then live for it. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3256.84s)]
*  What is it that you would want when you have everything in life is to do that [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3260.36s)]
*  now to get everything else in life. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3265.56s)]
*  It is really about doing things that matter. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3267.52s)]
*  Find something that can help a billion people live a better life and you create [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3271.0s)]
*  a hundred billion dollar company. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3275.04s)]
*  Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3276.56s)]
*  If you did, did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3278.64s)]
*  National Labs, that they spent billions on bio-defense weapons, the ability to [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3284.12s)]
*  accurately detect viruses and microbes by reading their RNA? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3289.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, a company called Viome exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3294.2s)]
*  Labs to build a platform that can measure your microbiome and the RNA in your [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3298.68s)]
*  blood. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3304.64s)]
*  Now, Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called full body [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3305.04s)]

*  I've asked Naveen Jain, a friend of mine who's the founder and CEO of Viome, to [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3369.48s)]
*  give my listeners a special discount. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3373.2400000000002s)]

*  Yeah, I think, you know, we've talked about this at Singularity University, where [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3379.2000000000003s)]
*  you're a fellow director of the company, you know, 10 to the ninth plus thinking, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3384.32s)]
*  yeah, what can you do to positively impact the lives of a billion people? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3390.4s)]
*  You know, as I like to say, the world's biggest problems, the world's big business [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3394.04s)]
*  opportunities, why become a billionaire, help a billion people. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3396.96s)]
*  All of those things are extraordinarily true. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3399.28s)]
*  And on the purpose front, you know, I'm writing my next book right now, again, with [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3401.76s)]
*  Steven Kotler called Age of Abundance. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3406.36s)]
*  And one of the things we're going to see as AI is coming in strong and we have, you [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3408.76s)]
*  know, GPT-5 onwards and we have AI agents and AI driven robots doing a lot of the [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3414.12s)]
*  things we used to do. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3421.68s)]
*  We're going to have to up level our purpose. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3423.56s)]
*  We're going to have to think much bigger than we ever have. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3425.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3429.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's, I think that's one of my greatest hopes for any entrepreneur watching [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3429.6000000000004s)]
*  this is go bigger, go after moonshots that truly inspire you and, and give [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3436.4s)]
*  extraordinary purpose to your life. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3445.96s)]
*  And Peter, if I may add to it, one of the techniques I have used to find your [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3448.44s)]
*  moonshot, and I think something that I would be thrilled for to talk to you about [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3453.52s)]
*  on that subject is, is people say this is what I want to do. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3457.84s)]
*  And I think it's very difficult for them to think big. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3462.4s)]
*  So the way I have explained to people how to think big is to say, OK, so now [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3465.8s)]
*  assume what you want to do is successful. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3470.52s)]
*  Now tell me what the world would look like and what would you do next? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3472.52s)]
*  And then you do that and say, now tell me if that is successful, what the world [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3476.72s)]
*  would look like and what would you do next? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3480.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3482.12s)]
*  And then you start to say, oh my God, that my purpose is really to do this, but I'm [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3482.48s)]
*  going to start here. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3486.6s)]
*  So this is how I start. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3487.84s)]
*  Doesn't mean that's my vision. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3489.7599999999998s)]
*  So you have a massive vision, but you start small and then you see this is how I [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3491.48s)]
*  start and see how I get there. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3497.2s)]
*  Nested moonshots. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3498.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3500.7599999999998s)]
*  Nested moonshots. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3501.12s)]
*  And I think that's very important. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3502.04s)]
*  And, you know, when I'm teaching moonshots, I'm, I'm asking you, OK, listen, we all [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3503.84s)]
*  know and you've experienced this, Naveen, I have that moonshots are not overnight. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3509.64s)]
*  They're overnight successes after 10 or 11 years of hard work. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3515.32s)]
*  OK, so if this is your moonshot in 10 years time, where do you need to be in five [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3518.44s)]
*  years? Where do you need to be in one year? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3523.72s)]
*  What can you do this month? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3526.24s)]
*  Today. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3527.96s)]
*  And what can you do right this minute to move you on that direction? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3528.52s)]
*  And taking that first step, the zero to one is the ratio of something to nothing is [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3532.12s)]
*  infinite. And I do I do love your your your point about, OK, now after your 10 [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3537.08s)]
*  year moonshot is achieved, what is the world like? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3544.4s)]
*  And, you know, so if if in the space world, if getting to orbit reusably was the [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3548.72s)]
*  moonshot, OK, now you can do that. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3554.16s)]
*  What's next? Is it Mars mining the asteroids? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3556.2799999999997s)]
*  Is it interstellar travel? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3559.56s)]
*  You know, is it is it reinventing society? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3561.36s)]
*  I mean, it becomes a lot of fun, right? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3565.04s)]
*  Life becomes an extraordinary, meaningful game. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3567.44s)]
*  And I think when we have, you know, digital super intelligence, you know, my [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3571.1200000000003s)]
*  belief is it's not that far away. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3577.2000000000003s)]
*  We are going to have to, you know, humans want purpose, humans need challenge. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3579.8s)]
*  So we're going to have to up level our purpose and our challenge once we get that. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3586.0s)]
*  Actually, more than that, it's become easier. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3589.04s)]
*  I think people are so wrong about AI that the AI somehow is going to destroy [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3591.64s)]
*  humanity. AI is going to be our tool that will allow us to do the things that we [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3597.3199999999997s)]
*  could not do before. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3602.48s)]
*  And the reason people are so scared of AI is because they think somehow it's going [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3604.0s)]
*  to magically happen one day and it doesn't happen. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3608.96s)]
*  It's not that E.T.'s are coming here and suddenly is such super intelligence and we [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3612.24s)]
*  don't know how to react to it. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3616.52s)]
*  These things happen over time and we start to merge with them. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3618.12s)]
*  And as we are merging with them, they become our partner. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3621.6800000000003s)]
*  And so it's not going to be today's human versus AI of five years from now. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3624.8s)]
*  It is going to be the AI four years from now plus us versus AI with five years [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3630.76s)]
*  from now. Right. So my point is because we are evolving with AI. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3636.2000000000003s)]
*  So the gap between the AI of five years from now is not going to be as much as [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3640.4s)]
*  with that because we constantly have integrated ourselves into the AI. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3644.64s)]
*  One of the things that Peter in the book that you're writing, I think, is absolutely [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3648.72s)]
*  I'm so happy you're doing it because every entrepreneur needs that. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3653.12s)]
*  In fact, in a very similar book that I am now writing is called Counterintuitive, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3658.2400000000002s)]
*  which is the same thing. Idea is how do we read? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3662.56s)]
*  How do we ask different questions? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3666.0s)]
*  And especially in the age of AI, the questions we ask is the problems we solve. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3668.36s)]
*  Right. The prompt becomes more interesting than the answer, because what questions [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3674.2799999999997s)]
*  are you asking? And you could probably say and this may be completely [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3678.68s)]
*  tangent that in sense, people who were enlightened and people who call them [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3683.72s)]
*  prophets were just better prompters. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3688.04s)]
*  Right. They were asking the right questions and the God GPT was actually [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3690.7599999999998s)]
*  answering them. So think of a God GPT that had the wisdom of all the knowledge [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3696.04s)]
*  from the beginning of time. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3701.24s)]
*  And people who became prophets and enlightened were actually asking a [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3703.16s)]
*  different question and right question. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3707.44s)]
*  And they were getting their wisdom back. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3709.52s)]
*  What's become God GPT actually responded to that prompt in a different way. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3711.48s)]
*  I like that. Next on my AI list and health care was modeling Alphafold 3 and [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3716.52s)]
*  beyond. So this is interesting, right? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3724.3199999999997s)]
*  So, you know this, when I take a prescribed medicine, it only works for [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3726.84s)]
*  like a third of the people it's prescribed for. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3735.32s)]
*  If you're lucky, if you're lucky, if you're lucky, I think that's an important [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3738.2000000000003s)]
*  asterisk on there. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3742.88s)]
*  You know, people need people think that when you take a medicine, oh, it's going [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3744.1200000000003s)]
*  to work for me. And the reality is when the FDA is approving a drug, it's doing [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3747.5600000000004s)]
*  two things. One, it's saying, OK, it's not harmful. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3753.04s)]
*  Or if it is harmful, we know how it's harmful and we're going to list those [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3756.2s)]
*  things. The second thing is it's useful in enough people that it's worth giving [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3759.96s)]
*  our approval. It doesn't work for everybody. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3764.96s)]
*  And that's crazy. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3767.88s)]
*  Everybody's better than placebo. All the heads have to be better than placebo. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3769.56s)]
*  Yeah. Or no worse than placebo, let's put it that way. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3772.4s)]
*  So there is a future in which I'm I've created an AI model of my biology in [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3777.16s)]
*  detail. So my three point two billion letters from mom and dad and what's [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3786.3999999999996s)]
*  functioning in my cell. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3791.56s)]
*  I know that this drug specifically works for me and this drug specifically [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3792.64s)]
*  counters this hallmark of aging. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3797.48s)]
*  And so we're going to start to create AI models of an entire human cell tissue [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3800.68s)]
*  organ, human being. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3806.04s)]
*  And that is that's a future that's incredible and coming fast. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3808.24s)]
*  Peter, not only I think only part that's missing in your vision is the hundred [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3816.4s)]
*  trillion microbes in your mouth and gut. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3821.04s)]
*  And the reason I'm saying you're right, you're right. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3823.44s)]
*  Don't underestimate the power of what is going on. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3825.28s)]
*  So when you're trying to create a digital twin, what we saw was identical [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3828.4s)]
*  paternal twins, identical twins. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3833.16s)]
*  When you feed them same stuff, they have a completely different response to it. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3835.2799999999997s)]
*  And there's been so many studies done on identical twins. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3839.08s)]
*  And I just want people to know that to create identical twins, it's not just [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3841.8799999999997s)]
*  three point two billion of letters that we have in our DNA, but also all these [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3845.7999999999997s)]
*  microbial side that we have to take into account and whether they are in our mouth [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3851.3999999999996s)]
*  all over our skin and in our gut, all of that stuff. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3856.08s)]
*  But answer is that is where the world is going to be headed. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3858.8799999999997s)]
*  Once we are able to create a digital twin of all of these things that we have in [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3862.92s)]
*  our body, the whole ecosystem as such, we will be able to personalize everything [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3869.48s)]
*  about us, a drug that is going to work or not work and which drug is going to work [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3876.56s)]
*  and how to make that drug to work. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3882.44s)]
*  So, for example, in many people, when they take the drug called Labdopa for [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3884.52s)]
*  Parkinson's, it does not work for them. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3889.04s)]
*  And it turns out that your gut microbes actually use tyrosine to completely nullify [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3890.88s)]
*  the Labdopa. It completely metabolizes the drug. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3897.88s)]
*  In fact, metformin actually works through gut microbiome. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3901.08s)]
*  And there was a research that just came out that shows the probiotic and metformin [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3904.8s)]
*  together actually improve diabetes better than either probiotic or metformin alone. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3908.88s)]
*  And you can predict. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3914.8s)]
*  We in fact published a paper, Peter, about a year ago that shows you can predict [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3915.92s)]
*  whether metformin is going to reduce your HbA1c or not based on your gut microbial [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3920.4s)]
*  activities. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3925.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3926.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, I apologize. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3927.56s)]
*  I should not be that short sighted to focus on our 40 trillion human cells. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3929.1600000000003s)]
*  It really is. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3933.76s)]
*  It really is the other 100 trillion bacteria, fungi, viri, everything in your [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3934.8s)]
*  system. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3941.28s)]
*  Because we are a very complex. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3942.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like looking at Earth and only looking at the people instead of all the [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3945.3199999999997s)]
*  billions of plants and animals and insects on the planet as well. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3950.04s)]
*  The next thing I listed and I think Viome is doing the closest to this. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3954.16s)]
*  Excited about the next iteration is, and I've said this before, if I go to Physician A [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3959.52s)]
*  and say, OK, this is my objectives. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3967.84s)]
*  I want to gain muscle mass. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3970.92s)]
*  I want more cognitive clarity. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3972.56s)]
*  I want to live longer. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3974.32s)]
*  And I say they do some tests and I say I want to take the best meds and supplements [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3976.6400000000003s)]
*  for those objectives. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3983.32s)]
*  Physician A will give me one set of meds and supplements. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3986.2000000000003s)]
*  Physician B will give me a different set. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3988.8s)]
*  Physician C will give me a different set. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3990.36s)]
*  And it's subjective. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3991.88s)]
*  It's what that physician happens to know and what that doctor happens to have read [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=3994.8s)]
*  about or what's in the fad. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4000.76s)]
*  And so the reality is there is an objective best. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4003.0s)]
*  And once you have enough data. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4008.0s)]
*  And so what is that data? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4010.6s)]
*  That data includes my genomics. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4012.12s)]
*  It includes my microbiome. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4015.52s)]
*  100%. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4018.9199999999996s)]
*  Let me not make that mistake again. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4019.56s)]
*  It includes my objective goals. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4021.8799999999997s)]
*  What I want to do. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4025.6s)]
*  How many pills am I going to take? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4027.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4028.72s)]
*  Because I take 75 pills right now. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4029.0s)]
*  When I'm switching over to Viome, typically how many supplements come in a pack for someone? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4032.04s)]
*  Eight. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4037.24s)]
*  Eight. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4037.7599999999998s)]
*  Eight. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4038.16s)]
*  Eight pills. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4038.68s)]
*  Eight caps. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4039.92s)]
*  That's it. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4040.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm going from 75 to eight. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4040.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4042.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4042.7999999999997s)]
*  But you're also getting a stick pack for your probiotics and you're getting your [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4043.68s)]
*  lozenges for your... [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4046.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4047.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, I am going to... [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4049.7999999999997s)]
*  It's going to be a lot easier. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4051.3199999999997s)]
*  Remember to take my pills every day. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4052.44s)]
*  By the way, does it matter what time of day you take those? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4054.3599999999997s)]
*  So normally we do four in the morning, four in the evening. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4057.12s)]
*  Or you can do all eight together in the morning. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4060.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4062.48s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4062.7999999999997s)]
*  This is going to be like major simplification of my life. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4063.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4066.88s)]
*  Long story short, there is an optimization and we're not there yet. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4067.68s)]
*  I think Viome is probably closing the cycle quicker than most individuals, than most companies. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4073.48s)]
*  But I think there is a future in which there is an optimized set of meds and supplements [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4082.12s)]
*  period and you're going to be able to know it. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4090.4s)]
*  And AI is going to do that for us. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4093.1200000000003s)]
*  The only way... [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4095.2000000000003s)]
*  Peter, today the reason you get different answers from different doctors are every [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4096.400000000001s)]
*  doctor has their own experience of 100 people, 1000 people, or if you're lucky, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4101.32s)]
*  10,000 people. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4105.360000000001s)]
*  No one has data for million people or 10 million people. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4106.68s)]
*  And once you have that, then you have all the co-morbidities, all of the confounding [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4110.88s)]
*  factors that no one has ever looked at. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4116.8s)]
*  In fact, human beings cannot process all the confounding factors. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4119.48s)]
*  They say, oh, this person has diabetes. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4123.36s)]
*  Give them that. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4125.0s)]
*  Well, the AI can say, but you know, he also has these following other co-morbidities and [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4125.84s)]
*  confounding factors that would not work here. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4131.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4134.04s)]
*  And that can only happen the more and more data. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4134.599999999999s)]
*  So the only other thing I will just clarify, Peter, is genetics is good, but I really [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4137.88s)]
*  think gene expression is probably more important. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4143.24s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4146.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4147.5199999999995s)]
*  Because I think people need to understand that when you say, oh, what do your [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4147.8s)]
*  genetics tell you about how long you live or what you should eat or all of those [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4152.4800000000005s)]
*  things, genetics are tombstone markers, meaning they don't change. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4157.68s)]
*  And there's something much more important. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4163.56s)]
*  And you really have built Viome around that. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4166.92s)]
*  And I'm a huge believer. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4169.68s)]
*  Please take it away. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4170.84s)]
*  Well, I think, Peter, as you know, your genes, as you mentioned, don't change, but [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4172.360000000001s)]
*  your gene expression is always changing and the gene expression is what makes you [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4176.48s)]
*  who you are. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4181.679999999999s)]
*  So, for example, every part of our body is identical DNA. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4182.879999999999s)]
*  Yet we have hair and we have kidneys and we have art and we have neurons all come [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4186.5599999999995s)]
*  from the same DNA that we same DNA can make all the different things. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4191.12s)]
*  And what is expressed is really what makes us who we are. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4195.4s)]
*  So understanding the gene expression is the key to understanding your health and [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4198.719999999999s)]
*  your disease. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4205.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4206.5199999999995s)]
*  So we monitor our DNA. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4207.04s)]
*  So we look at the mitochondrial gene expression. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4209.28s)]
*  We're looking at all of the immune system expression of which, by the way, you saw [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4212.0s)]
*  the research, Peter, the IL-11 inhibitor that actually reduced the biological [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4217.28s)]
*  significantly. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4222.599999999999s)]
*  I got 25 percent. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4223.719999999999s)]
*  Twenty five percent. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4225.4s)]
*  And that's just the IL-6, you know, in IL-11, which is the IL-6 function. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4226.36s)]
*  So I think really think ultimately understanding what is causing the IL-11 to go [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4234.36s)]
*  up. What can we do to actually inhibit the expression of IL-11? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4240.16s)]
*  Doesn't mean it doesn't exist. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4245.24s)]
*  It is the expression. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4247.08s)]
*  So similarly, you're trying to reduce the pro-inflammatory gene expression. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4248.56s)]
*  You want to increase the anti-inflammatory gene expression. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4252.92s)]
*  And you might be really proud of me. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4256.32s)]
*  I just got my results on the biological age test from glycan age this morning. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4258.04s)]
*  What would be your guess, Peter? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4262.759999999999s)]
*  What would be your guess? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4263.96s)]
*  What is your chronological age? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4264.799999999999s)]
*  You're sixty four? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4267.2s)]
*  I'm turning 65 in September. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4267.879999999999s)]
*  Sixty five in September. Amazing. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4270.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4271.679999999999s)]
*  So your glycon age, forty five. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4272.719999999999s)]
*  Thirty three. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4276.4s)]
*  Thirty three. Amazing. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4277.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4278.839999999999s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4279.679999999999s)]
*  So half the man you used to be. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4280.0s)]
*  Well, or at least I'm twice the man that I need to be. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4282.879999999999s)]
*  That means I can probably now live to be a long time and get to watch Peter doing [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4287.36s)]
*  amazing things. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4291.36s)]
*  So the reason I mentioned that is it's basically looking at the anti-inflammatory [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4292.04s)]
*  and the pro-inflammatory markers in your body. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4297.4s)]
*  And that's looking at the gene expression is the key to understanding why some [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4299.92s)]
*  people get sicker and other people don't, even though they have identical DNA. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4305.28s)]
*  So you have, in fact, you, Peter, you have twins, right? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4311.16s)]
*  Identical DNA. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4313.759999999999s)]
*  Well, they're not fraternal twins. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4315.04s)]
*  They're not. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4316.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4317.5599999999995s)]
*  They're not identical twins. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4317.839999999999s)]
*  They're fraternal twins. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4318.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4319.839999999999s)]
*  Real quick. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4320.48s)]
*  I've been getting the most unusual compliments lately on my skin. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4321.36s)]
*  Truth is I use a lotion every morning and every night religiously called OneSkin. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4325.08s)]
*  It was developed by four PhD women who determined a 10 amino acid sequence that [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4330.599999999999s)]
*  is a synolytic that kills senile cells in your skin. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4336.88s)]
*  And this literally reverses the age of your skin. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4340.599999999999s)]
*  And I think it's one of the most incredible products. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4343.88s)]
*  I use it all the time. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4346.08s)]
*  If you're interested, check out the show notes. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4348.48s)]
*  I've asked my team to link to it below. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4350.32s)]
*  All right. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4352.32s)]
*  Let's get back to the episode. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4352.5599999999995s)]
*  Tell me, tell me, what are you doing to reduce your inflammatory? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4354.04s)]
*  What do you think you're doing most that is reducing your inflammation load? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4356.759999999999s)]
*  So Peter, again, it is avoiding the foods that Vion tells me to avoid because those [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4363.12s)]
*  foods cause inflammation. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4368.5199999999995s)]
*  Eating my superfood to increase my anti-inflammatory markers and then taking [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4370.16s)]
*  the set of supplements and biotics and oral laws and this to constantly just adjust my [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4375.0s)]
*  microbiome to actually make sure that they're not producing anything that causes [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4381.04s)]
*  inflammation. So reducing the sulfide production, reducing the ammonia production, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4385.2s)]
*  reducing the LPS production. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4389.24s)]
*  And those are the kind of things that you do. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4391.08s)]
*  Then your immune system is always ready, but it's balanced. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4393.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just going to go and real quick look at my superfoods and my [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4397.36s)]
*  avoid foods. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4403.56s)]
*  My avoid foods. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4404.400000000001s)]
*  One moment. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4406.0s)]
*  Nutrition. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4407.72s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4409.08s)]
*  Just for fun. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4410.0s)]
*  You can, you can share me yours. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4411.360000000001s)]
*  So my, I'm going to my avoid foods first. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4414.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4417.6s)]
*  Avoid artichoke. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4418.400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4420.4400000000005s)]
*  And by clicking on that, it'll tell you why. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4420.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4423.240000000001s)]
*  So artichoke as a prebiotic food, rich in insulin, or whatever, why you should avoid [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4424.120000000001s)]
*  methane gas production pathways. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4431.92s)]
*  I guess I'll make my kids feel better. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4434.4800000000005s)]
*  No, actually, methane gas also, by the way, is inflammatory. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4437.360000000001s)]
*  So it's not just about the methane gas. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4439.6s)]
*  It actually has no smell, just in case you're wondering. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4441.2s)]
*  It is actually inflammatory. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4443.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4445.56s)]
*  Beef, avoid beef, avoid black beans, which is a surprise. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4447.2s)]
*  And by the click on that, it'll tell you why. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4450.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4453.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4453.8s)]
*  Again, again, methane, methane gas production. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4454.2s)]
*  And then it goes on in detail. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4459.400000000001s)]
*  And probably the meat, red beet is probably is because of TMA. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4461.0s)]
*  And the beef is about TMA production and LDL cholesterol pathways. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4465.6s)]
*  And by the way, besides telling me why, it also gives me a scientific reference, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4471.56s)]
*  which is fantastic. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4475.88s)]
*  Avoid butter. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4478.16s)]
*  I do that already. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4478.8s)]
*  Avoid cane sugar. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4479.64s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4480.8s)]
*  I do that. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4481.52s)]
*  Avoid cheese, cow milk cheese. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4482.48s)]
*  I do that already. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4484.24s)]
*  And these are things that inherently, but these are inherently things that make me [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4485.44s)]
*  feel bad. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4489.96s)]
*  And here's, so it's a food, you know, for me, cheese is a food allergy. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4491.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4496.76s)]
*  Avoid buffalo, avoid caviar. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4499.88s)]
*  That's a bummer. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4503.2s)]
*  Sony's not going to be happy about that. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4503.96s)]
*  And that must be TMA as well, I think. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4506.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4508.2s)]
*  So the, where's the caviar? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4509.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4512.92s)]
*  The TMA. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4513.28s)]
*  Like I said, Naveen, I need to award you a medical degree from one of my universities. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4514.32s)]
*  So here it's now avoid egg yolk, which is new for me. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4520.2s)]
*  Avoid eggplant. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4525.84s)]
*  I've always known that. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4527.08s)]
*  Avoid grapefruit. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4529.32s)]
*  Avoid honey. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4531.4800000000005s)]
*  So now let's talk about what my superfoods are. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4533.28s)]
*  So, cause you know, don't want to have it all me be avoiding. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4538.08s)]
*  So almonds, apples, arti... [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4541.6s)]
*  Oops. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4545.08s)]
*  I'm going to click on almonds and tell you why. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4545.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4548.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4548.4s)]
*  So almonds supports heart health, good blood sugar response, oral inflammatory pathways. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4548.76s)]
*  And arugula. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4558.4800000000005s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4561.92s)]
*  I want to just only, oh, only superfoods. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4562.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4564.84s)]
*  I click on that button to get rid of the avoid. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4565.320000000001s)]
*  Beets, broth, broccoli. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4568.280000000001s)]
*  I love broccoli. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4570.08s)]
*  My favorite, my favorite Brussels sprouts, cabbage, celery. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4570.8s)]
*  But they are white for me that broccoli and the sparse avoid for me. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4575.240000000001s)]
*  Really interesting. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4578.84s)]
*  Cranberries, gingers, a superfood, grapes are superfood. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4580.400000000001s)]
*  That's good. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4585.84s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4587.84s)]
*  Mung beans, sprouts, olive oil. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4589.08s)]
*  They're awesome. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4592.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4593.2s)]
*  Olive oil is like my, my most, yeah, I love olive oil. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4593.4800000000005s)]
*  Being Greek, of course. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4599.12s)]
*  Pomegranates, raspberries, salmon. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4600.12s)]
*  Superfoods. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4603.24s)]
*  Salmon. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4604.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4604.88s)]
*  Wild-caught salmon for sure. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4605.16s)]
*  That's like my number one go-to meal. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4606.5199999999995s)]
*  Spinach, Popeye would be happy. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4608.8s)]
*  Tofu, turmeric, white mushrooms. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4611.84s)]
*  So by the way, 30% of the people are harmed by spinach because of high oxalates in spinach. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4613.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4619.4s)]
*  So, I mean, in fact, it's really interesting that we put together and looked at a lot of [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4619.599999999999s)]
*  the people that considered healthy food. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4623.36s)]
*  How many people are actually harmed by them? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4625.12s)]
*  No, it is, you know, we have these generalizations and we get our, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4627.5599999999995s)]
*  our food advice from, you know, from our cartoons and from, you know, from the FDA's [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4632.84s)]
*  ancient food permits and, you know, at the end of the day, you can know. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4641.88s)]
*  Do you want to know? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4647.84s)]
*  Do you want to take the time to know? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4649.08s)]
*  My last AI and health sort of transformative impact is surgical robots. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4651.92s)]
*  So, you know, today, I think you know this, but just to share it with folks listening [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4660.88s)]
*  here, if you need to get a surgery, there's one question you ask when you're interviewing [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4665.76s)]
*  a surgeon and please don't just pick the first surgeon that comes to you. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4671.04s)]
*  And that question is how many times have you done the surgery this morning? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4676.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4680.68s)]
*  In other words, there is a, the reason is a surgeon who's done many of them. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4681.0s)]
*  In fact, sometimes you see places where there's like a surgical... [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4685.84s)]
*  Assembly line. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4689.76s)]
*  Assembly line, right? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4690.4400000000005s)]
*  Where the surgeon is going in, doing a surgery and next, those are the best surgeons. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4691.6s)]
*  They've seen so many circumstances, so many variations that they're not caught off guard [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4694.96s)]
*  by something going on. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4699.76s)]
*  They have massive experience. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4701.16s)]
*  You know, your brain is a neural net and it's being trained by everything you see. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4703.0s)]
*  And so you want a surgeon that's seen a lot and trained up their neural net. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4706.72s)]
*  Because it's really, it's a hand skill coordination and it's a knowledge coordination. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4710.6s)]
*  So in the future, we're going to see surgical robots that have seen not just a thousand [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4714.96s)]
*  cases or five thousand cases over their career, but have seen, you know, you know, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4722.44s)]
*  50 million cases because they share all of their knowledge across every surgery, every [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4728.08s)]
*  done, ever done as part of the operating system. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4733.28s)]
*  And they don't have fights with their girlfriends or boyfriends. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4736.16s)]
*  They can see in infrared and ultraviolet. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4739.2s)]
*  They don't have too much coffee or hands not shaking. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4741.719999999999s)]
*  So I think that's coming. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4744.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think they also can create a virtual view of the world so they can have, you know, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4746.5599999999995s)]
*  that 3D view so they can literally see everything around them so they know where they are, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4751.48s)]
*  as opposed to the doctor actually trying to figure out where they are. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4756.92s)]
*  They are constantly knowing where they are in the body. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4760.28s)]
*  And I really think they just no doubt in my mind at the end of the day, the robotic [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4763.24s)]
*  surgery is here to stay. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4767.96s)]
*  And we hope that one day we won't even need that because our nanoparts will be repairing [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4769.839999999999s)]
*  our organs. And so you won't even need that. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4774.639999999999s)]
*  All right. 100 percent. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4777.44s)]
*  So as we promised, let's talk about raising kids. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4778.919999999999s)]
*  I want to hear your advice. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4782.4s)]
*  So before we go to raising kids, give me an overview, pal. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4785.16s)]
*  Remind me what it was like for you growing up in India. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4790.12s)]
*  Where were you born? What was life like in your early days? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4793.12s)]
*  So Peter, we grew up very, very poor in India. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4795.44s)]
*  We had no place to stay. We had no food to eat. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4798.32s)]
*  We would have a town or village. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4801.48s)]
*  Where were you? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4803.24s)]
*  We didn't have a place. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4803.96s)]
*  Peter, we moved every every probably 12 months, 18 months. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4805.24s)]
*  We moved from village to village because my father decided not to take any bribes. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4808.799999999999s)]
*  And if you don't take a bribe, his boss didn't get any money. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4813.04s)]
*  So he was constantly transferred from one village to another village until we went to [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4815.679999999999s)]
*  such remote villages where there was no nothing to be built, nothing to be built. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4820.4s)]
*  Nothing to be done. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4825.0s)]
*  So he's not taking anyone's bribe. Right. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4825.88s)]
*  So we grew up in very, very rural. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4829.04s)]
*  Your dad was working for the government? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4831.4800000000005s)]
*  Government work. Yeah. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4834.0s)]
*  So he worked in a public works department. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4835.200000000001s)]
*  His job was to build the buildings and the road. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4837.56s)]
*  And and they rather not use cement. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4839.88s)]
*  They wanted to use contractor use the sand and half cement [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4842.76s)]
*  so they can save money and then give it to the bribe the people in that [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4846.68s)]
*  in a government for the bribe. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4849.96s)]
*  You know, coming from there, despite all of that, my sister went on to become a post [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4851.68s)]
*  doctorate in applied mathematics. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4858.72s)]
*  My brother has a PhD in statistics and computer science. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4860.84s)]
*  I was the probably the least educated person ended up getting engineering from IIT, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4863.88s)]
*  which is one of the top schools and then did my MBA. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4869.2s)]
*  Came to the United States about 42 years ago. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4874.12s)]
*  How old were you? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4878.16s)]
*  Nothing in my forty five dollars in my pocket. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4878.68s)]
*  Ended up in New Jersey. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4881.12s)]
*  You were you were you were twenty three at the time. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4882.12s)]
*  Twenty three at the time. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4885.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And and God has been very kind to us. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4886.12s)]
*  God has been just extremely kind to us. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4891.08s)]
*  And today we sit here with everything that we could have possibly ever imagined. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4893.52s)]
*  And more. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4899.320000000001s)]
*  Our children grew up here in an extremely affluent family. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4900.4400000000005s)]
*  And there was never a time, you know, even though in the early days when the kids were [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4904.8s)]
*  young, my wife will say, you know, and will say, you know, maybe we should tell children [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4909.0s)]
*  that we don't have much money. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4913.2s)]
*  We can move into a small house. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4914.4400000000005s)]
*  And I said, sweetie, one day they're going to learn to read. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4915.8s)]
*  They know that that is not that doesn't quite work. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4918.16s)]
*  So you may as well change how we talk to them about money. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4921.84s)]
*  So we decided we're going to fundamentally change the concept of what success is. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4926.2s)]
*  So we told them that your success is never measured by how much money you have in the bank. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4931.24s)]
*  It's measured by how many lives you improve. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4935.32s)]
*  Your self-worth is never going to come from how much you own. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4938.4s)]
*  Your self-worth comes from how much you create. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4942.44s)]
*  That means you can own a lot that you inherited. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4945.0s)]
*  But if you haven't created anything, you're still a parasite on humanity. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4947.8s)]
*  So please don't be a parasite. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4951.24s)]
*  Go do something meaningful. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4953.04s)]
*  And then we really start to look at every single aspect of the world. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4955.599999999999s)]
*  We start to look at everything that we did. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4959.8s)]
*  What we learned in the early days, Peter, was children don't do what you tell them to do. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4962.64s)]
*  They do what they see you do. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4967.72s)]
*  And that's the beauty of the thing is to when I was running Infospace, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4969.92s)]
*  the company was worth 40 billion dollars. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4974.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4976.52s)]
*  And the point I'm trying to mention is that at that time, the kids were young. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4978.320000000001s)]
*  I could have easily said, hey, I'm going to now retire. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4984.12s)]
*  I want to spend time with my children. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4987.72s)]
*  And what it would have been, people would have said, oh my God, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4990.08s)]
*  how nice of Navin to actually give up his career and spend time with the kids. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4992.88s)]
*  That is a selfish thing to do because it's good for me. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=4998.76s)]
*  I want to get that pleasure. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5001.16s)]
*  But from a kid's perspective, what they would have seen is dad made a lot of money. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5002.56s)]
*  When I go to school, he's sitting on the sofa watching CNBC. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5007.320000000001s)]
*  He comes back. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5010.52s)]
*  When they come back from school, that's his work hard. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5011.52s)]
*  Hard work is what it takes. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5014.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5015.400000000001s)]
*  And they're sitting, watching dad sitting on the sofa watching CNBC. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5016.12s)]
*  They say, I want to grow up just like my dad, sit on the sofa and watch CNBC. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5019.32s)]
*  Now, instead of reading the stories in the evening, we will have them create stories. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5023.599999999999s)]
*  So instead of teaching them stories, we say, hey, can you tell me a story about a monkey [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5028.5599999999995s)]
*  and an ocean and a palm tree? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5034.0s)]
*  And they need to now come up with a way to connect the dots together, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5037.12s)]
*  because we wanted them to see how everything in the world can be connected. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5041.0s)]
*  Now, dad, you tell me a story about these three things. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5045.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5048.0s)]
*  The idea was to start to show them how to connect the dots in the world. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5048.4s)]
*  The most important thing, Peter, was giving them intellectual curiosity. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5052.84s)]
*  As a job of a parent is not to take the kids to the water and make them drink, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5058.04s)]
*  but make them thirsty. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5062.16s)]
*  And the way to create thirst is intellectual curiosity. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5063.599999999999s)]
*  And this is really interesting, Peter, you're going to admire. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5066.96s)]
*  So when a kid comes and says, oh, look at Peter, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5069.12s)]
*  he's wearing an amazingly great black sweater. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5072.44s)]
*  You don't say, oh, yes, that is a really great sweater. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5076.12s)]
*  You say, you know, uncle or, you know, Jack, that, you know, the black doesn't really exist. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5078.719999999999s)]
*  It is a simply the electromagnetic waves, the photons that are hitting our light [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5085.44s)]
*  and the color is created in our brain. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5090.44s)]
*  And so, you know, what you're seeing is actually not real. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5092.879999999999s)]
*  And the reason is you want them to challenge everything, even that they think that they can [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5096.36s)]
*  take it for granted. That's the black sweater. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5101.68s)]
*  Right. The point is, once you challenge them to start taking that, every single thing can be challenged. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5104.16s)]
*  Even the thing that they're seeing with their eyes may not be right. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5110.04s)]
*  It allows them to start thinking about how to challenge everything that they have. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5113.8s)]
*  And as we wrap up here, the last thing really is allowing them to ask the right questions. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5119.52s)]
*  Right. So when we talk about solving world hunger, you don't talk about how do we increase the yield of the food, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5125.16s)]
*  how do we reduce the wastage, instead of asking how to produce more, you question about why do we eat food? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5131.48s)]
*  Right. And you simply, when you say, why do we eat food, you need energy. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5138.08s)]
*  And what are the different ways to get energy? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5143.32s)]
*  And suddenly the solutions that you are seeing are very different than simply growing more food and wasting food. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5145.16s)]
*  And we can go on and on about symptoms and the root cause, but that's really the way of actually educating children. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5151.5199999999995s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5158.04s)]
*  You know, when I drop my kids off at school, my parting words are ask great questions today. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5159.0s)]
*  Right. And when I advise CEOs in the Abundance Summit, it's, you know, ask great questions today. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5165.16s)]
*  It really is about the questions you ask in life. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5173.12s)]
*  Like you said, God GPT, sort of, you know, what are you prompting? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5175.88s)]
*  You know, I had the pleasure to get to know your kids early on and spend time with Angkor and Priyanka and Neil, and they've interned and work with me. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5180.64s)]
*  Neil actually interned for you. I mean, he learned more from you than I could have ever thought. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5194.200000000001s)]
*  So how do you think about the at their ages of, you know, sort of 14 to 18 to 23? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5198.6s)]
*  You know, what is your advice on what kids should be doing during that period of time? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5211.8s)]
*  How important is the school they go to? [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5219.56s)]
*  How important is the experiences they have? Go deeper there. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5221.56s)]
*  So, Peter, I think this is something so important and so crucial. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5225.44s)]
*  I think taking children to learn about different things. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5229.28s)]
*  So essentially taking kids to Abundance 360, I mean, to me or taking them to Singularity University, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5232.719999999999s)]
*  there is nothing, no better investment you would ever do in your children to bring them, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5239.44s)]
*  to expose them to different things that are out there that they don't even know about. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5245.04s)]
*  Exposing them to coming to Abundance 360, having them learn about AI, having them learn about [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5249.92s)]
*  what nanotechnologies are, having them to learn about what is coming up allows them to start [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5255.360000000001s)]
*  thinking about what is possible. And that is the key. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5260.72s)]
*  The best investments you make in children are exposing them to different ideas, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5265.200000000001s)]
*  different things about different possibilities, as opposed to having them find their passion early. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5270.400000000001s)]
*  Your job should be to expose them to different ideas, different people, taking them to work, [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5277.6s)]
*  taking them to actually see how you work, seeing them that you are humans, you make mistakes, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5283.36s)]
*  but really taking them to these places where you learn. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5289.6s)]
*  So if you find Abundance 360 to be useful, why not bring your children there? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5293.28s)]
*  If you find Singularity University to be helpful, why not bring your children there? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5298.0s)]
*  And Peter, as you know, all three of our kids went to Singularity University. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5301.92s)]
*  All three of them were involved with XPRIZE because they saw the possibilities coming out of XPRIZE. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5305.68s)]
*  All of them have come to Abundance because they see what they can learn. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5312.400000000001s)]
*  And to me, that is the best thing I can ever offer parenting advice is take them to great [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5316.4800000000005s)]
*  places where they can learn and be exposed to different ideas. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5323.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. Navin, where do people follow you? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5326.64s)]
*  Where do they learn more about your books, the work that you do? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5330.160000000001s)]

*  and how much you've created and how much you've combined, it's just a beautiful thing. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5378.0s)]

*  I absolutely love you like a brother. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5387.92s)]
*  I just cannot thank you enough for what you have done for me and our family. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5390.08s)]
*  And I'm always in debt with you. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5393.6s)]
*  All right, buddy. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5395.84s)]
*  Excited for the life we're living together. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5396.96s)]

*  We'll see what we get. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br7OLJeVNf0&t=5401.76s)]
