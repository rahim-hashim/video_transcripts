# AI Panel Discussion Pt. 2 | EP #97
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ)
*  We're building a supercomputer with Intel and we just released some results showing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  that the next generation at stable diffusion 3 runs faster on Intel chips than Nvidia chips. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=4.96s)]
*  All those companies will succeed in parallel. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=9.92s)]
*  There's no worry about competition whatsoever. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=12.8s)]
*  It's leveraging talent, not replacing talent. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=14.76s)]
*  It's unleashing the creativity of talent instead of bogging down in it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=17.02s)]
*  So I mean nobody here feels like we're putting ourselves out of business. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=21.28s)]
*  We feel like we've got more things we want to do than ever. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=25.64s)]
*  Could one person by themselves with no in-house team, no W2 employees build a company worth [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=28.12s)]
*  a billion dollars? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=34.64s)]
*  I don't know what you think. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=35.64s)]
*  I think it's possible. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  As we automate more and more of our economy, we're just going to aim higher and go for [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=38.9s)]
*  bigger wins. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Every room we walk into, there's all of these adjacencies we never knew existed before. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  And these are opening up before us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=48.16s)]
*  They're literally materializing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=49.72s)]
*  Please, sir. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=52.72s)]
*  The nurse from London. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=55.44s)]
*  I wanted to find out from Invincible. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=56.56s)]
*  I mean, perhaps you already know this, and I'm sure you do, but it's a marketing opportunity. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=60.6s)]
*  All of us here are CEOs of our companies or have enough money to start companies. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=67.28s)]
*  If you could make us as individuals AI savvy in whatever we do, we can then transpose that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=74.36s)]
*  information onto our boards, onto our companies, and that might give you a lot more business. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=84.6s)]
*  That's a great observation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  What's the question? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=94.16s)]
*  The question is, can you sort me out my life? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=96.0s)]
*  Yes, Dinesh, I love that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=100.44s)]
*  So that I can use AI more efficiently in my, you know. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=105.56s)]
*  That's why we're here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=110.94s)]
*  That's why we're here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=111.94s)]
*  There's an app for that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=112.94s)]
*  Please come meet with our team. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=114.7s)]
*  We're here at the booth, and we'd love to get to know you and build a relationship. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=117.3s)]
*  We're a very relationship-driven business. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=120.02s)]
*  And this is, you know, it's not just a today thing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=122.5s)]
*  In the last 12 months, think about how much innovation has happened. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=125.8s)]
*  In the next 12 months, there will be more innovation. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=129.5s)]
*  So just like Lord of the Rings, there's not one ring to rule them all in AI. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=131.22s)]
*  There's going to be so many different apps and models. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=137.18s)]
*  The question is, how do you integrate them into your business? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=140.44s)]
*  And that's an evolutionary thing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=143.72s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to default to like 20-second answers. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=145.0s)]
*  Let's go to Golcom on Zoom. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=149.12s)]
*  Last year, you were talking about building up country models. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=151.16s)]
*  Have you proceeded with that? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=154.88s)]
*  I think so. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=156.84s)]
*  What's the result? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=158.68s)]
*  Yeah, so we've done Japan about to release Spain and about a dozen others. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=159.68s)]
*  And the plan is to go to probably 100 cultural models by this time next year, and then open [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=166.6s)]
*  data sets for all of them so you can take them and remix them with all the other models [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=172.68s)]
*  that everyone else has as well. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=177.44s)]
*  Going to Robert on Mic 1. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=178.44s)]
*  Yeah, hey, this is for Imad. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=179.44s)]
*  Just following up on you, you were showing yesterday the 100 cats per second and how [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=182.9s)]
*  good we're getting at that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=187.32s)]
*  How long, just super simple, how long till I can take my favorite book or novel and just [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=189.84s)]
*  feed it into the computer and have the computer make it a movie or a Netflix series? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=195.88s)]
*  It's a very big computer in the cloud, about two years. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=202.0s)]
*  Two years until we can do that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=205.32s)]
*  Yeah, it won't be real time, but I'd say two years because movies are made up of lots of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  short scenes and we can already do short scenes and now it's all about how we bring it together. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=212.12s)]
*  Does anybody on here disagree with that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=216.16s)]
*  How long till a good movie? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  Well Netflix is mostly crap. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=220.4s)]
*  Just making a bunch of clips is not what a movie is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=221.4s)]
*  I would argue, I have a counterpoint, which is the editing of stitching scenes together [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=223.28s)]
*  is a very deep art form. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=229.0s)]
*  I would guess that that's the longest to be automated. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=231.32s)]
*  Would you agree? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=234.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's why it's two years, not one year. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=235.2s)]
*  All right, let's go to Yash on Mic 2 here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=237.4s)]
*  I have a question for Dave. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=239.72s)]
*  Dave, I come from India. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=242.2s)]
*  I'm a venture and growth equity investor there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=244.6s)]
*  And India is relatively a nascent landscape for AI. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=248.12s)]
*  What would be the first three investments that you would make, whether it will be infrastructure [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=252.16s)]
*  oriented, if you have to start investing with harnessing artificial intelligence over there? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  That's really, really easy actually because the first question we had is the answer to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=263.8s)]
*  your question. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=266.84s)]
*  If I were in India where millions of people have taken Alexander Amini's class, who was [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=268.68s)]
*  on stage yesterday, huge educated AI ready population. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=272.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, companies like you just heard are saying, how on earth am I going to act on [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=276.92s)]
*  anything I'm seeing today? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  So if you connect those two dots, what they should be doing is investing at the seed stage [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=282.8s)]
*  in groups of 10 or 20 people that you assemble. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  And then you say, okay, but then you be the first customer for what we just created and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=290.44s)]
*  guarantee me my first five million of revenue. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=294.48s)]
*  Your company will skyrocket in value. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  You can do it 30 times in a row. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=298.68s)]
*  They'll actually get the delivery they need on everything you're hearing in this session. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=301.12s)]
*  Will that be different from invisible? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=306.56s)]
*  Would the landscape and the, does it need to be customized for India or can something [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=309.68s)]
*  like an invisible only come and do this? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=315.96s)]
*  Will it end up competing in something like an invisible? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=318.64s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=320.56s)]
*  It's almost exactly what happened when the relational database was first invented and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=321.56s)]
*  every company needed one all of a sudden. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=325.32s)]
*  And there must have been 50 or 80 successful companies that were delivering in all the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  different vertical sectors. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=331.32s)]
*  And it wasn't until five or 10 years later that they all aggregated and Oracle bought [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=332.56s)]
*  a bunch of them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=336.48s)]
*  But you don't have to worry about that for years. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=337.48s)]
*  What matters right now is that there's never been a technological shift this quickly and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  this globally impactful before. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=344.12s)]
*  And the analogy to the relational database is a joke. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=346.64s)]
*  It's like this is hundreds or thousands or millions of times bigger than that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=350.0s)]
*  And it's much more urgent. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=353.74s)]
*  So all those companies will succeed in parallel. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  There's no worry about competition whatsoever. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=358.24s)]
*  Over the years, I've experimented with many intermittent fasting programs. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=360.32s)]
*  The truth is I've given up on intermittent fasting as I've seen no real benefit when [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=364.36s)]
*  it comes to longevity. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=369.76s)]
*  But this changed when I discovered something called Prolon's five day fasting nutrition [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  program. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=376.52s)]
*  It harnesses the process of autophagy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=377.52s)]
*  This is a cellular recycling process that revitalizes your body at a molecular level. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=379.86s)]
*  And just one cycle of the five day Prolon fasting nutrition program can support healthy [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=384.78s)]
*  aging, fat focused weight loss, improved energy levels and more. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=390.82s)]
*  It's a painless process and I've been doing it twice a year for the last year. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=394.5s)]
*  You can get a 15% off on your order when you go to my special URL. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=399.29999999999995s)]

*  Now back to the episode. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=415.26s)]
*  Hi, I'm Caitlin Krauss and my MTP is to empower meaningful human connection through imagination, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=416.26s)]
*  wonder and awe. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=423.78s)]
*  And my question is about digital well-being because we want to use AI and we want to use [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=425.58s)]
*  it mindfully and it's a time when there's a lot of noise in the world. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=430.46s)]
*  So what advice do you have about people who are interested in wonder and awe like me using [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=434.82s)]
*  them in spatial, immersive environments, how to do that without increasing the noise factor [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  and all of the static? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=445.72s)]
*  One of the challenges we're going to face is just like with our use of GPS, if we're [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  not careful, it can erode our ability to navigate. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  I can't figure out which way. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  I know up and down. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=461.20000000000005s)]
*  That's about it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=462.20000000000005s)]
*  So interestingly enough, this is going to be a little controversial perhaps, but I've [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  started to be able to tell who uses chat GPT for their thinking. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=468.76s)]
*  The people that use chat GPT all the time, they actually start to think, they sort of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=474.84s)]
*  feel like a Gaussian blur of the internet. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=479.0s)]
*  And so I think as we think about what it is to create well-being, we need to be thinking [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=482.96s)]
*  about how do you create a developmentally aware set of AIs so that you know at any time [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=488.56s)]
*  where a human being is and what is the next possible place they can move such that it [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=495.88s)]
*  removes the dependence on the sort of teacherly authority AI versus like creating greater [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=501.24s)]
*  dependency. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=506.88s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=507.88s)]
*  Let's go to Charles on Zoom. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=508.88s)]
*  Charles. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=510.88s)]
*  Hi. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=511.88s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=512.88s)]
*  Salim, I'm going to start with you. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=513.88s)]
*  I'm trying to build an exponential organization. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=516.36s)]
*  So one of the first requirements is staff on demand. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=519.64s)]
*  So why don't you debate invisible about how you would use them and even bring in, say, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=523.06s)]
*  about a marketing campaign and then bring in Steve Brown and Brittany as to how you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=530.0999999999999s)]
*  would do the investor relations for this business. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=541.2199999999999s)]
*  I think you just answered the question. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=542.2199999999999s)]
*  So the obvious thing to do is in an EXO, you want a small resource footprint as possible [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=545.02s)]
*  and partner wherever possible. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=550.4799999999999s)]
*  So a partnership with something like invisible is fantastic because you just go help me sort [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=552.68s)]
*  that out. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=557.4799999999999s)]
*  What I love about the model is they're helping you build that muscle. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  And over time, it's going to be really important to have as much musculature inside your organization [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=561.7199999999999s)]
*  to be applying some of these tools. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=566.64s)]
*  Then you can maximize leverage and impact from that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  And if you want Brittany to do your earnings calls, she's available. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=572.62s)]
*  Let's go to David here on mic three. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  David. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=578.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm curious about using AI to make myself the best person I can be. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=579.84s)]
*  And just open to the forum, are there any recommendations you have? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=585.44s)]
*  Should I be uploading all the emails I've ever written, all of my journal entries? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=591.48s)]
*  Is there a way to get myself into AI so that I can learn more about myself? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=596.72s)]
*  Is that a worthwhile effort? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=601.88s)]
*  And should I be documenting my thoughts every day, my inner psychoses? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=602.88s)]
*  Yeah, just curious about that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=608.8s)]
*  The AIs are doing it already, so don't worry about that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=611.68s)]
*  Just start talking to it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=616.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of people that are users and creators on top of the AI stack are worried [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=618.28s)]
*  that they're not deep in the foundation of it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=624.48s)]
*  But when Snapchat went public, $20 billion valuation, it was 5,400 lines of code. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  It was just a tiny, tiny little thing on top of all the tech. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=633.48s)]
*  What you're seeing in media right now is the question earlier was how long until we can [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=637.4s)]
*  create a feature-length movie just by voice prompting it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  But that's not the target. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=645.44s)]
*  In media, what's taking over is short form, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, short form. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=646.44s)]
*  So with AI on top of this, there's going to be media that's billions and billions of dollars [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=652.0s)]
*  that's long before a feature-length movie. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=658.16s)]
*  That's the wrong target. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=660.84s)]
*  So I think anyone who jumps in is going to find that you can build micro communities [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  around any topic. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=666.1999999999999s)]
*  If you have anything interesting to say in the world at all, you'll find followers. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  And you can use the AI right now as a force multiplier for yourself no matter what your [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=671.48s)]
*  mission is. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=675.8s)]
*  So whatever you're good at and whoever is interested in what you're doing, you can immediately [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=676.8s)]
*  act on it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=679.76s)]
*  You don't have to worry about being where Ramin is. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=680.76s)]
*  Very, very few people are where he is in this world. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  Many more people are on top of it. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=686.8399999999999s)]
*  But there's a huge opportunity there. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=688.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's go to Pete, mic two. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=690.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=692.64s)]
*  I would like to know if you have an idea about how it will have an impact on IT infrastructures, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=693.64s)]
*  mostly data centers. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=702.84s)]
*  Where will you put those infrastructures? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=704.88s)]
*  They will be larger or smaller? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=707.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=709.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the trend is to go larger data centers, bigger clusters, GPU dominant, right? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  At the moment, GPUs are the best type of computer to run these AI algorithms and higher bandwidth, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=720.88s)]
*  right? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=727.84s)]
*  Because you're trying to achieve data parallelism, do some model parallelism even because the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=728.84s)]
*  models are too big to fit in any one memory. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=732.6800000000001s)]
*  And so faster interconnect, bigger clusters, more power. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=736.0s)]
*  That's the trend so far, right? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  Unless something comes and disrupts that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=742.08s)]
*  Most data centers historically have tried to be close to the customer and the user to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=744.52s)]
*  keep the latency down. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=747.72s)]
*  You don't have to worry about that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=748.72s)]
*  You want to be close to the power supply. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  That's the big difference. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=751.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, fascinating. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  There's also a whole bunch of models where you can use crypto tokens for cloud AI cloud [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=753.8000000000001s)]
*  compute. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=757.76s)]
*  Those are getting very interesting. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  So check those out. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=760.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=761.32s)]
*  Let's go to Blake on Zoom. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=762.32s)]
*  Hi, everyone. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=763.32s)]
*  Thank you guys for sharing with us today. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=766.32s)]
*  It's been amazing. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=768.08s)]
*  I'm just wondering as we get better at the automation and consolidation of all of these [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=769.08s)]
*  tasks, what is the end goal that we see as far as the number of companies that we are [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  all going to have the opportunity to build and then the lack of need for people within [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=783.48s)]
*  those companies? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=789.48s)]
*  It seems like markets could get oversaturated. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=790.48s)]
*  So I think for the Invisible team specifically, where do you guys see the corporate space [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=792.88s)]
*  in five years? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=800.48s)]
*  All running companies that we don't necessarily have to put time in to run. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=802.4s)]
*  I love this question. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=806.4s)]
*  Sam Altman talked about the one person unicorn. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=808.4s)]
*  Could one person by themselves with no in-house team, no W2 employees build a company worth [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=811.4s)]
*  a billion dollars? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=817.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know what you think. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it's possible. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=820.8s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it's not a new idea. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=822.48s)]
*  About 100 years ago, there was an economist named Ronald Coase and he realized that it [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  was possible in the future to have more and more of your team be outsourced. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=829.96s)]
*  Do you know that only 5 to 10% of knowledge work is outsourced today? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=834.6800000000001s)]
*  By 2050, do we think it's going to be a higher number? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=840.08s)]
*  Maybe 25 to 50%. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  Maybe that one person unicorn has 99% of their team on Invisible. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=844.62s)]
*  And that's exactly the future that we're powering. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=849.8000000000001s)]
*  But I don't believe that we're going to get to 90% unemployment. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=852.2800000000001s)]
*  I think that if the nature of the firm shrinks because of technological capabilities, there's [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=855.52s)]
*  just going to be a wave of entrepreneurship. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=861.68s)]
*  All this talent gets liberated to do new stuff. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=864.1999999999999s)]
*  There will still be things that humans can do that computers still can't. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=867.48s)]
*  So thank you for that question. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=870.8s)]
*  Just to add to that, Peter and I did a whole podcast about we needed three people, a three-person [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=872.72s)]
*  team could create a billion-dollar company, a vision guy, a product guy, and a builder. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=877.24s)]
*  Sam, of course, went to one. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=884.28s)]
*  But think about the idea, if you go down where Steve is going, where you essentially get [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=886.52s)]
*  to fully autonomous AI building its own companies. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=890.56s)]
*  Now, things get really weird. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=893.4799999999999s)]
*  And I think navigating this is going to be pretty much dominating the business landscape [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=895.76s)]
*  for the next decade or so. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=900.24s)]
*  Which actually brings up the next really important point, which is right now there is an incredible [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=901.88s)]
*  amount of money going into figuring out how do you make AIs aligned? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  How do we make sure they do what we say they're going to do? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=910.92s)]
*  But if an AI is wielded by a corporation that isn't aligned with all of our best interests, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=914.4399999999999s)]
*  it's not really an aligned AI. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=920.4s)]
*  So I think a major opportunity for everyone here to start thinking about is what are evals, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=922.56s)]
*  the thing that evaluates an AI, what are evals for corporations? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=928.28s)]
*  Because when the corporations punch, they can punch a hole in the Amazon if they're [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=932.76s)]
*  just out there operating autonomously. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=935.68s)]
*  That's incredibly dangerous. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=938.76s)]
*  I would say we've had ways to align corporations for many decades now. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=941.9200000000001s)]
*  I think that applies to having AI workers within your workforce. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=947.52s)]
*  To me, the future is not necessarily unemployment. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=952.6800000000001s)]
*  It's actually corporations maybe being 80% AIs, 20% humans. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=956.0s)]
*  But we have way more corporations and we're far more ambitious with what we do, right? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=960.76s)]
*  Ultimately, if you think like a physicist, the system will grow and try to unlock more [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=965.04s)]
*  for energy. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=970.92s)]
*  Does that mean colonizing Mars because there's a lot of opportunity out there? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=971.92s)]
*  Potentially, right? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=975.4s)]
*  There's a lot of upside, but it's behind a lot of challenges. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=976.4s)]
*  And so I think as we automate more and more of our economy, we're just going to aim higher [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=979.24s)]
*  and go for bigger wins. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=984.12s)]
*  Yeah, Gil brings in a really important – it's the abundance mindset, right? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=985.4s)]
*  It really is. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=989.92s)]
*  We are – every room we walk into, there's all of these adjacencies we never knew existed [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=991.0s)]
*  before and these are opening up before us. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=996.1999999999999s)]
*  They're literally materializing, right? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=998.88s)]
*  The adjacencies. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1002.16s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1003.16s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1006.24s)]
*  love. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1011.36s)]
*  The company is called Fountain Life. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1012.36s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1013.36s)]
*  physicians. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1018.68s)]
*  Most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1020.28s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1024.0s)]
*  Until that day where you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1025.84s)]
*  room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1029.86s)]
*  or four going on. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1034.0s)]
*  And it didn't start that morning. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1035.56s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1038.32s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1041.8s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1045.38s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1050.8400000000001s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1055.6200000000001s)]
*  CT, looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1061.94s)]
*  blood workup. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1067.66s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1069.0600000000002s)]
*  250 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1072.5s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1079.18s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1082.3s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1084.26s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1086.54s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1089.46s)]
*  to your life and we provide them to you at our centers. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1093.36s)]
*  So if this is of interest to you, please go and check it out. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1098.22s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1102.98s)]
*  When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1107.16s)]
*  to us for Fountain Life memberships. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1113.2s)]
*  If you go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter, we'll put you to the top of the list. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1115.34s)]
*  Really it's something that is for me one of the most important things I offer my entire [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1121.26s)]
*  family, the CEOs of my companies, my friends. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1126.18s)]
*  It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1129.98s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1135.3s)]
*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1138.02s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1141.58s)]
*  My question and comment has to do with ownership and power, right? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1143.54s)]
*  So there's five or six companies that right now are setting themselves up to pretty much [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1148.06s)]
*  own everything. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1151.54s)]
*  What I don't hear about are decentralized systems, decentralized LLMs that could work [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1153.4599999999998s)]
*  like Bitcoin or Ethereum can work where no one actually owns the network, but there's [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1159.9399999999998s)]
*  incentives to contribute, use, provide CPU, GPU power, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1164.84s)]
*  It seems to me that this would be society's golden opportunity to have no one necessarily [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1171.34s)]
*  own these networks, just like in the future I think no one is going to own decentralized [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1176.98s)]
*  finance. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1182.82s)]
*  I'm curious if you have an opinion as to why we're not hearing more about this. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1183.82s)]
*  I just read about Project Morpheus, which I think looks really interesting, but I'm [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1187.86s)]
*  not really reading a lot about any kind of big movement in this direction. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1191.1s)]
*  Go to huggingface.co and look at the number of models that are there that are open source. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1195.54s)]
*  It's something like 600,000 now. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1201.4199999999998s)]
*  That means there's probably a couple million entrepreneurs at least because I don't think [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1204.26s)]
*  everybody has their own model, but there's a lot of entrepreneurs doing a lot of things [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1210.34s)]
*  decentralized and that are super empowered now. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1214.94s)]
*  You hear about the big tech thing and you look at their demos and half the time they're [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1218.3s)]
*  faked or they don't work, but all the cool stuff is being done by these small start-ups [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1221.9199999999998s)]
*  and super powered entrepreneurs. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1225.94s)]
*  I think the actual opposite is happening. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1227.62s)]
*  A year ago I was exactly where you were. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1229.6599999999999s)]
*  I thought, oh my gosh, it's a winner take all thing. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1231.58s)]
*  Microsoft OpenAI is going to take everything. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1234.58s)]
*  Now it's like, oh my gosh, that's a commodity. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1236.98s)]
*  It's thousands and thousands of flowers blooming right now. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1240.18s)]
*  When I set up Stability, originally it was meant to be a DAO of DAOs and decentralized. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1243.94s)]
*  I realized there wasn't much intelligence in Web 3, so I had to build it first. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1247.8600000000001s)]
*  Yesterday I joined the board of render, for example, and we're going to use hundreds of [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1252.5800000000002s)]
*  thousands of GPUs to create synthetic data sets for media. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1255.8200000000002s)]
*  There's more coming along those lines. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1260.26s)]
*  We've had 330 million downloads of our models on Hugging Face already. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1261.7800000000002s)]
*  The next step is how do we decentralize it, give ownership to everyone? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1265.7800000000002s)]
*  With the national example, for example, we're talking to governments. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1269.42s)]
*  Can we give ownership of the governance of the data to every citizen in every country? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1273.0200000000002s)]
*  I think this will become less about the models as a basic base model, they're like graduates, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1277.42s)]
*  and more about who controls and owns the data. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1281.9s)]
*  Those data sets are on Hugging Face too. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1285.3000000000002s)]
*  I really want to applaud, Imad, what you're building and doing. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1287.7s)]
*  It's a beautiful vision. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1291.46s)]
*  Let's go to Zoom. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1293.46s)]
*  Andre, you? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1294.46s)]
*  Peter, one quick thing. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1295.46s)]
*  Just go check out a token called Hypercycle, which is trying to do this, democratizing [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1296.54s)]
*  AI compute in the cloud, and people can build their own models and just bring in compute [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1302.5s)]
*  as they need it. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1307.98s)]
*  There's some amazing stuff happening in the decentralized Web 3 world. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1308.98s)]
*  On to Zoom. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1313.74s)]
*  Andre, you? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1314.74s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1315.74s)]
*  This could go a bit wrong. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1316.74s)]
*  Both my kids are still awake and my wife is on business trip. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1319.3400000000001s)]
*  Love it. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1321.94s)]
*  They paid attention. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1322.94s)]
*  For sure, the question is how can they buy the Google Glasses? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1325.54s)]
*  Let me ask my question that I asked you yesterday, Peter. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1328.7s)]
*  We've seen Nvidia share go from, I don't know, increased to 885, right? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1332.82s)]
*  Raised more than $600 as they increased their power on AI computation. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1339.18s)]
*  My question is a bit twofold. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1344.7s)]
*  One is, did you guys see this coming, that a company could grow so much within a year? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1346.2s)]
*  The second one is, do you guys see any other company following that could bring good tech [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1351.06s)]
*  to this? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1357.22s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1359.94s)]
*  I'm sure your kids asked you that question, too. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1360.94s)]
*  So I saw Gil, you're nodding. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1365.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Nvidia was, what was it, a year and a half ago, the price was irrational. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1369.98s)]
*  Everybody who's a practitioner knew that Nvidia is so dominant in the AI space because of [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1378.26s)]
*  their compilers and their hardware. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1383.42s)]
*  What doesn't make sense to me at this point is why AMD is not really on their tails. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1386.22s)]
*  It has to do with software, with community, with open source. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1391.98s)]
*  Friend of mine, George Hots, is working on the compiler for AMD. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1395.7s)]
*  So if something happens there and he has a lot of influence, that could catch up. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1399.42s)]
*  So that's kind of like public companies. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1403.94s)]
*  In the private space, we're trying to be the next Nvidia, obviously, for all sorts [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1406.14s)]
*  of reasons, with a fundamental paradigm shift. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1411.5400000000002s)]
*  And that's the only way to, as a very small player, disrupt an incumbent. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1415.0600000000002s)]
*  But overall, I would keep my eye in the public markets on AMD first and then potentially [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1419.94s)]
*  Intel as kind of next up. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1424.9s)]
*  Eventually, the advantage has to be eroded to some extent. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1427.7s)]
*  I'm curious, who's thinking about Intel right now and its ability? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1431.0600000000002s)]
*  So we're building a super computer with Intel and we just released some results showing [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1435.3s)]
*  that the next generation at stable diffusion 3 runs faster on Intel chips than Nvidia chips. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1440.8999999999999s)]
*  The Gaudi 3 chip is the same as the B100 in speed pretty much on a price performance basis. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1446.7s)]
*  But everything will commoditize there and it's about the entire sector going huge. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1451.7s)]
*  This is one of the biggest infrastructure investments ever. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1455.98s)]
*  So you can play the beater to the sector from AMD to Intel. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1458.54s)]
*  Nvidia probably still isn't done. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1461.58s)]
*  It's still only 34 times earnings. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1462.82s)]
*  Stacey, are you in the room here? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1464.86s)]
*  Stacey's one of our patrons who's a senior VP at Intel. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1467.46s)]
*  Let's go to Pete. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1471.6599999999999s)]
*  Hi guys, I'm the data center guy. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1473.6599999999999s)]
*  So Gil, I need to find the venture capital firm that I could put money into because I [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1474.98s)]
*  want to invest in it today, not tomorrow. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1478.62s)]
*  I want to help you get there. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1480.54s)]
*  But my question is, besides the data center guy, I got a killer software app that I need [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1481.54s)]
*  help growing. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1485.82s)]
*  And so for the invisible guys, do you do, I want to get it right from the beginning. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1486.82s)]
*  So will you help a startup? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1491.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we work across the complete spectrum. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1494.74s)]
*  We work with companies with five, ten people just getting started all the way up to the [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1497.58s)]
*  biggest companies in the world. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1501.78s)]
*  And so we have customers spending a thousand, two thousand dollars a month. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1503.54s)]
*  We have customers spending millions of dollars a month. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1507.1s)]
*  And so everywhere across that spectrum, we'd love to bring you on that journey. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1509.22s)]
*  Helping companies grow and create amazing value is what really drives us. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1513.98s)]
*  Did you know that your microbiome is composed of trillions of bacteria, viruses and [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1518.4199999999998s)]
*  microbes and that they play a critical role in your health? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1523.3s)]
*  You know, research has increasingly shown that microbiomes impact not just digestion, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1526.34s)]
*  but a wide range of health conditions, including digestive disorders from IBS to Crohn's [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1531.5s)]
*  disease, metabolic disorders from obesity to type two diabetes, autoimmune disease [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1537.18s)]
*  like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, mental health conditions like depression [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1542.78s)]
*  and anxiety and cardiovascular disease. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1547.78s)]
*  You know, Viome has a product I've been using for years called Full Body Intelligence, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1550.3799999999999s)]
*  which collects just a few drops of your blood, saliva and stool and can tell you so much [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1555.9399999999998s)]
*  about your health. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1560.86s)]
*  They've tested over 700,000 individuals and use their AI models to deliver key critical [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1562.1799999999998s)]
*  guidelines and insights about their members' health, like what foods you should eat, what [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1568.82s)]
*  foods you shouldn't eat, what supplements or probiotics to take, as well as your biological [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1573.58s)]
*  age and other deep health insights. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1578.7s)]
*  And as a result of the recommendations that Viome has made to their members, the results [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1581.26s)]
*  have been stellar. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1586.22s)]
*  As reported in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, after just six months, members reported [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1587.64s)]
*  the following, a 36% reduction in depression, a 40% reduction in anxiety, a 30% reduction [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1593.54s)]
*  in diabetes and a 48% reduction in IBS. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1601.1000000000001s)]
*  Listen, I've been using Viome for three years. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1604.82s)]
*  I know that my oral and gut health is absolutely critical to me. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1607.42s)]
*  It's one of my personal top areas of focus. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1612.42s)]
*  Best of all, Viome is affordable, which is part of my mission to democratize health care. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1615.68s)]
*  If you want to join me on this journey and get 20% off the Full Body Intelligence test, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1620.48s)]
*  go to Viome.com slash Peter. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1625.6200000000001s)]
*  When it comes to your health, knowledge is power. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1627.8600000000001s)]
*  Again, that's Viome.com slash Peter. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1630.9s)]
*  Lars. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1634.38s)]
*  Hey, I'm Lars from Stockholm originally. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1635.38s)]
*  I live in San Diego now where I met Francis, what was it, 12 years ago something. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1638.8600000000001s)]
*  And we are there, we talked about the role and the Coase theorem, why corporations exist. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1644.18s)]
*  One of the reasons is to internalize all the uncertainties and organize the labor force. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1649.8000000000002s)]
*  And I'm so impressed by both what you have created, you and the whole Invisible team, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1655.74s)]
*  but also Peter, this is awesome. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1661.62s)]
*  What a great conference. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  It's totally stimulating and so much talent, not only on the stage, but also in the whole [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1665.3s)]
*  room here. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1670.58s)]
*  There's lots of entrepreneurs and builders who are creating new businesses every day. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1671.58s)]
*  And it's very much about talent. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1676.02s)]
*  We have talent here on the stage. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1678.04s)]
*  And I'm in the talent industry myself, holistically, building recruiting companies, matching companies, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1681.26s)]
*  and similar things. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1687.7399999999998s)]
*  I think at the core, everything will also be about talent here. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1689.86s)]
*  We have had this wonderful debate about the future of AI and the long term, is it a threat [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1695.1s)]
*  or is it an abundance? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1701.5s)]
*  Is it a blessing? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1703.9399999999998s)]
*  I think everybody can obviously agree though that it's going to replace talent, people [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1705.1799999999998s)]
*  out there. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1709.86s)]
*  And of course, it's a paradox that some of the best new non-biological talent in the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1711.1s)]
*  world is created by great biological talent, ask yourselves, gentlemen, or the women by [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1716.86s)]
*  the way, on the stage right now. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1722.58s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1725.02s)]
*  Where are the women on the stage? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1726.02s)]
*  Where'd Caroline go? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1727.02s)]
*  But on that point, you are a wonderful individual, biological talent, and we're creating solutions [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1728.02s)]
*  now to replace biological talent out there in order to reallocate resources, of course, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1735.78s)]
*  the future so people can do even more what they want. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1742.86s)]
*  But I do think that's a blessing. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1745.4s)]
*  But in the meantime, for the next five, 10 years, we know things are going to go fast. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1747.2800000000002s)]
*  What do you think about the future of talent, the future of the workforce? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1752.4s)]
*  Because that is something we can all agree to, that there needs to be some kind of fixes [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1755.2s)]
*  there because it's going to go fast. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1759.76s)]
*  And you don't want to have a major social unrest in the world when those 100 billion [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1761.6000000000001s)]
*  people are replacing the biological talent. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1766.0s)]
*  And what's the future of education to? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1769.3600000000001s)]
*  Are kids going to train themselves into the future? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1771.8400000000001s)]
*  I know! [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1774.7199999999998s)]
*  Amazing! [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1775.7199999999998s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1776.7199999999998s)]
*  Let me address the future of work side first because we've done a lot of thinking about [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1777.7199999999998s)]
*  this and we've watched this over decades now. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1780.6399999999999s)]
*  It turns out when you look through human history, when there's a major automation of something, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1784.1599999999999s)]
*  the instant reaction is, oh my God, we're going to have millions of people out of work. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1790.1999999999998s)]
*  What actually happens is we create a ton more work that needs to get done. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1793.4399999999998s)]
*  I'll give you a specific example. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1796.9199999999998s)]
*  In the 1970s when we created bank ATM machines, there was all sorts of hand waving going, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1799.3s)]
*  oh my God, millions of bank tellers, what will we do with them, et cetera. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1804.5s)]
*  What actually happened was the cost of running a branch dropped by ten times. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1807.8999999999999s)]
*  The banks created ten times more branches and the number of bank tellers has not changed [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1812.34s)]
*  at all. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1816.02s)]
*  Same thing with truck drivers. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1817.26s)]
*  As we automate truck drivers, go to any trucking company and they're like, we can't wait for [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1818.5s)]
*  autonomous trucks because we would hire a thousand truck drivers if we could find them [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1822.86s)]
*  right now. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1827.3799999999999s)]
*  We have an underemployment problem today, not an unemployment problem. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1828.46s)]
*  Can we say what happens to the talent, though? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1832.38s)]
*  As you automate, as you've seen in the studies. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1836.0200000000002s)]
*  Terin Southern should be up here to answer this question. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1838.42s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1840.5s)]
*  Are you out there? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1841.5s)]
*  Who? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1842.5s)]
*  Terin Southern. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1843.5s)]
*  She said the most beautiful thing is she described how this has affected her. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1844.5s)]
*  It used to be 90% process, 10% creativity. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1848.94s)]
*  Now it's 90% creativity, 10% process. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1852.5400000000002s)]
*  So it's leveraging talent, not replacing talent. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1855.6200000000001s)]
*  It's unleashing the creativity of talent instead of bogging down in it. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1857.98s)]
*  Nobody here feels like we're putting ourselves out of business. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1863.5s)]
*  We feel like we've got more things we want to do than ever. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1866.58s)]
*  We'll just write ten times more code, a hundred times more code. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1869.14s)]
*  Don. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1872.06s)]
*  Yeah, guys. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1873.06s)]
*  I'm trying to revive Europe by creating 21,000 people who are those entrepreneurs that can [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1874.14s)]
*  be a unicorn one-man show. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1880.38s)]
*  I get asked all the time, okay, where do I start? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1883.1s)]
*  So much stuff is happening and I was wondering now that I have you on stage, what is the [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1886.74s)]
*  one thing of the last 12 months that you handed over to an AI or the one task that you would [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1890.86s)]
*  say for anyone becoming this one-person unicorn, where do you start? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1896.1399999999999s)]
*  What's the first skill that they should acquire after they got their mindset right? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1901.4599999999998s)]
*  Well, the first thing you need is an MTP or your massive transformative. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1905.02s)]
*  What fundamental problem do you want to solve? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1909.08s)]
*  And then everything cascades from there. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1910.82s)]
*  So if you go read the EXO book that Peter and I wrote, there's a whole chapter on how [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1913.26s)]
*  you build one with steps in it. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1917.1399999999999s)]
*  So it's pretty clear. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1919.46s)]
*  And we now have a community of 35,000 people that are just building EXOs nonstop. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1920.46s)]
*  That's what I meant, if they have the mindset right, so I assume they have the MTP, what's [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1926.06s)]
*  the first skill that they then acquire? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1929.62s)]
*  So it's not about skills. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1932.06s)]
*  Today it's just about getting out there and doing, right? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1934.06s)]
*  So step one is your MTP. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1936.36s)]
*  Let's say it's curing cancer. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1938.26s)]
*  Step two is go find communities that are doing that or join communities or create communities [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1940.02s)]
*  that are interested in that. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1944.7s)]
*  Step three, you create your founding team of one people, three people, whatever the [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1946.62s)]
*  small number is. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1950.02s)]
*  Step four, you find a breakthrough product or idea that will deliver at least 10x better [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1951.5s)]
*  than the marketplace in one specific domain around that. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1955.7s)]
*  Because if you're 10% better, the market will ignore you. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1959.02s)]
*  If you're 10 times better, you can't be ignored. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1961.94s)]
*  And then you follow lean startup thinking, get to an MVP and you're cascading down the [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1964.92s)]
*  And we've watched this process be copied and used now for 10 years with staggering results. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1969.9399999999998s)]
*  So just go do it. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1975.4599999999998s)]
*  It's about execution, not skill acquisition. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1977.5s)]
*  Please. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1980.2199999999998s)]
*  I have a very simple question. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1981.2199999999998s)]
*  Which page are we in the copyrights? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1985.02s)]
*  Books, papers? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1988.02s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1990.02s)]
*  This is exactly what happened when Google was growing like crazy. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1994.26s)]
*  It wasn't clear at all that scraping the Internet and indexing it was legal under copyright [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=1996.22s)]
*  law. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2000.22s)]
*  And Google grew through it and then said, hey, just put a tag on your website if you [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2001.7s)]
*  don't want us to scrape it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2005.78s)]
*  But everybody didn't put the tag on because everybody wants to be searchable on Google. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2006.78s)]
*  This is growing so quickly that the same thing will happen. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2010.16s)]
*  People are going to use the AI. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2013.7s)]
*  There's billions of dollars of revenue that's going to flow. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2014.7s)]
*  People like Reddit are saying, hey, you can't use our content without paying us a fee. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2017.5s)]
*  That'll blow over in a minute. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2021.94s)]
*  At the end of the day, there's so much capital flowing in, nobody's going to want to be left [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2024.7s)]
*  out of it. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2028.74s)]
*  So it's literally not going to be an issue. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2029.74s)]
*  If you don't contribute your content, there's equal content out there anyway. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2031.74s)]
*  So it's literally not going to be a problem. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2035.6200000000001s)]
*  It is a threat to everyone who has copyright. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2038.02s)]
*  But there's no stopping it at this point. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2040.94s)]
*  Where is the best way to find world-class capital partners if you're an AI startup? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2044.54s)]
*  It's so easy right now. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2049.1s)]
*  If you go to any of the Ventra Studio models, any of the demo days, and work backward from [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2050.66s)]
*  who's attending the demo days, those are your targets. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2056.14s)]
*  Or if you get a PitchBook account, I don't know if you use PitchBook, it's a little pricey, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2059.1s)]
*  shows you every deal that's happening in the country. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2062.62s)]
*  And you can work backward. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2065.54s)]
*  If you're looking for that idea where three, four, five people are worth a billion, you [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2066.66s)]
*  can easily sort, find it, and look at what they did. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2071.7s)]
*  And that answers the prior question about Europe as well. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIidMryjSJQ&t=2074.1s)]
