# How to Build & Implement Systems to Grow Your Business w/ Francis Pedraza | EP #106
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI)
*  You've taken a completely different strategy than most entrepreneurs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=0.0s)]
*  I think this will create a new era in entrepreneurship. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4.68s)]
*  The world is run by these 20th century services giants. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=10.96s)]
*  And for whatever reason, venture capitalists, Silicon Valley, the technology industry is [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=15.4s)]
*  not counter positioning against them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=20.2s)]
*  If you're getting ready to start your company, if you're the CEO of an existing company, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=22.2s)]
*  if you're looking at scaling, I want you to hear what Francis has to say because it will [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=26.38s)]
*  have you pause on what you're doing and look at your company and your vision and your plan [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=33.1s)]
*  in a completely different way. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=39.1s)]
*  Do you have a company culture where the resolve, the commitment to the mission is so high that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=40.5s)]
*  everyone had to enter ramen mode if you couldn't pay them and they just had to go on the equity [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=46.82s)]
*  and you were just giving them stock, the stock that you would otherwise give investors? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=50.9s)]
*  How many people at your team would stay? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=54.66s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=56.38s)]
*  We're about to dive into an extraordinary conversation with Francis Pedreza. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=61.34s)]
*  He is the CEO of Invisible Technologies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=64.9s)]
*  Invisible has gone from near zero revenue to almost $300 million in just four years, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=67.38s)]
*  an extraordinary growth. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=73.1s)]
*  And Francis's customers, none other than OpenAI, the top banks, DoorDash, extraordinary companies [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=75.34s)]
*  that are using Invisible to help scale their processes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=83.54s)]
*  If you're at the beginning of your journey and you want a mechanism to operationalize, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  use AI, use automation, Invisible is a company for you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=92.7s)]
*  But what we're going to be discussing here is Francis's philosophy as a founder CEO, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=96.78s)]
*  the decisions he made on where to raise capital and not raise capital, how to hire amazing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  people and make them partners. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=109.58000000000001s)]
*  This is a masterclass on a different way of being an entrepreneur and succeeding in the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=111.86s)]
*  process at an extraordinary speed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=117.46s)]
*  Please take notes, listen up, excited for you to use these approaches in your Moonshots. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=120.42s)]
*  All right, let's dive into Francis Pedreza, the CEO of Invisible Technologies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=126.18s)]
*  Everybody, welcome to Moonshots. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=131.7s)]
*  I'm here with a friend now for the last 15 years, Francis Pedreza. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=133.62s)]
*  Francis, good to see you, buddy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=137.66s)]
*  Peter, thanks for taking the time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=139.62s)]
*  Yeah, we're in for a conversation around a different level of entrepreneurship. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=141.14s)]
*  I think a masterclass in being a Moonshot entrepreneur. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=149.22s)]
*  If you're getting ready to start your company, if you're the CEO of an existing company, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=153.82s)]
*  if you're looking at scaling, I want you to hear what Francis has to say because it will [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  have you pause on what you're doing and look at your company and your vision and your plan [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=164.78s)]
*  in a completely different way. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=170.62s)]
*  Now, Francis, I hope I'm not over promising here, but I love what you're doing and you've [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=172.06s)]
*  taken a completely different strategy than most entrepreneurs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=179.26s)]
*  Perhaps it has to do with your background as a philosopher. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=183.98000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to call you not a philosopher king, but a philosopher entrepreneur. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=186.86s)]
*  Let's kick it off first with at the top level, what is Invisible? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  And then I want to dive into how it's different, how your philosophy of building this Moonshot [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  company is different than most everybody else out there and the lessons you've learned [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=203.26s)]
*  because they're worth writing down if you're taking notes during this podcast. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=208.7s)]
*  So kick it off. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=213.66s)]
*  Tell us about what Invisible is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  Invisible is operations as a service. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=216.46s)]
*  So we make it easy for companies to delegate core business processes that they use to run [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=219.9s)]
*  their business. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=226.7s)]
*  And the biggest company in the world that does this is Accenture. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=227.73999999999998s)]
*  They have almost a million people, Peter. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  They're a third the size of the US military, which is the biggest organization on the planet. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=234.54s)]
*  And they do $63 billion of annual revenue. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  And the industry is called business process outsourcing, BPO, business process outsourcing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  And Accenture is not a technology company. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=249.26s)]
*  They do not run all of their operations on a single platform. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=252.06s)]
*  And they bill by the hour. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=256.06s)]
*  So their incentive is to bill as many hours as possible without getting fired. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=257.34s)]
*  And so they're the blockbuster that we're trying to Netflix. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=263.18s)]
*  They're the Lockheed Martin that we're trying to SpaceX. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=265.97999999999996s)]
*  And there's a three prong disruption. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=269.34s)]
*  The first is pricing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=272.06s)]
*  We do results based or value based pricing wherever we can. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=274.14s)]
*  So I'll tell you some examples. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  Insurance company came to us, was one of our first big clients. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=280.06s)]
*  And they said, hey, can you run our claims processing? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=283.18s)]
*  Can you run underwriting checks? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=285.58000000000004s)]
*  It was price per claim process, price per check passed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  Then DoorDash came to us during the pandemic and had said, hey, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=290.70000000000005s)]
*  can you digitize every restaurant menu in the United States and help us launch in Germany and Japan? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  And it was a price per menu digitized. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=298.22s)]
*  And OpenAI came to us the beginning of 2022 saying, hey, we have swallowed the entire internet, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=301.5s)]
*  but GPT is hallucinating. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=309.18s)]
*  How do we improve quality? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=310.62s)]
*  And we came up with ways of hiring PhDs and masters to train GPT to do that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=312.22s)]
*  And it was a price per conversation train. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=318.54s)]
*  That alignment of incentives means that better, faster, and cheaper is good. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  It's in everybody's interest. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=328.86s)]
*  It's a win-win. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=330.3s)]
*  And that creates the alignment with the client and the alignment with technology itself. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  And then the second prong of disruption is technology. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=337.02000000000004s)]
*  Reusable processes are reusable rockets. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=340.54s)]
*  SpaceX was able to disrupt Lockheed Martin because Lockheed Martin was billing cost plus. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=345.74s)]
*  And so their incentive was to just bill NASA and the Air Force a ton of hours. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=353.18s)]
*  And SpaceX said, what if we charge for the launch itself and price per launch, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=357.18s)]
*  results-based pricing? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=362.94s)]
*  And they then had to vertically integrate. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=364.38s)]
*  And I just toured in LA. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=367.34s)]
*  They have 38 hangar bays, and they're actually manufacturing Starships in Los Angeles. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=369.26s)]
*  And that approach gave them a series of technological advantages. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  We have built a similar thing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=381.02s)]
*  We call it our digital assembly line. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=382.85999999999996s)]
*  So you've got to imagine Henry Ford about 100 years ago was thinking about how to do [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  mass production to make the first automotives. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=389.5s)]
*  And that is the same approach we're doing for knowledge work. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=393.74s)]
*  So we break down our clients' processes into steps like Legos. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=398.29999999999995s)]
*  And we've integrated 300 third-party AI and automation tools into a process builder. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=402.62s)]
*  So when we take our clients' processes and we break them into these steps, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  we can automate as much of those processes as possible with all the tools that are out there. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  We have our own AI and automation team. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=419.74s)]
*  But you can't automate every single step in a process. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=421.74s)]
*  To do complex work, you've got to be able to plug in humans to do the stuff computers [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=425.42s)]
*  still can't do. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=428.94s)]
*  So we have over 3,000 people now in over 100 countries around the world, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=429.90000000000003s)]
*  including PhDs and masters, that we can plug in to do the remaining steps. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  And that allows us to deliver an end-to-end solution that is like Ops as a service. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=439.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's the technology advantage. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=444.7s)]
*  And then the final advantage, Peter, is culture. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=446.38s)]
*  That's the third prong of the disruption, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=448.94s)]
*  which is that we're 70% owned by our team. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=451.02s)]
*  And so in our company culture, we don't act like employees. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  We act like partners. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=458.62s)]
*  And we call each other partners. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=459.74s)]
*  And at the end of every month, we're looking at the income statement, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=461.41999999999996s)]
*  the balance sheet, the cash flows. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  Everyone is able to ask each other, what's the strategy? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=466.14s)]
*  What's the ROI? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  How do we do better? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=471.41999999999996s)]
*  And that creates a kind of sense of urgency about how to move the needle on the stock price, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=472.62s)]
*  how to make the company better all the time. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=478.7s)]
*  And that sense of camaraderie is often missing in mega corporations. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=481.26s)]
*  So it's a rebel alliance culture versus the galactic empire of 20th century services companies. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=486.38s)]
*  – I love it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=492.38s)]
*  And it's been extraordinary growth, right? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=493.74s)]
*  You started the company in 2015, is that correct? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=496.7s)]
*  – That's right. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=500.06s)]
*  – I've known you for a bit of time. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=500.94s)]
*  And it wasn't really – I mean, you iterated a little bit. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=502.62s)]
*  And it's been – you hit a formula that's been extraordinarily successful. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=505.82s)]
*  When did you hit that stride, you think? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=510.38s)]
*  – Yeah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=511.9s)]
*  Well, one of the things I – one of the reasons I trust you so much, Peter, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=513.74s)]
*  is that your loyalty saw me through my first business failure. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=517.26s)]
*  I started a company right out of college. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=520.62s)]
*  You were an advisor to it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=522.38s)]
*  It was called Everest. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=523.5s)]
*  And we had a half a million people download it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=525.58s)]
*  It was an iPhone app to help people achieve personal goals. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=528.14s)]
*  Apple featured it a lot. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=531.18s)]
*  It was a beautiful, pure software product. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=532.46s)]
*  But it didn't have a business model that was profitable. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=535.42s)]
*  And so the company ultimately failed. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=540.22s)]
*  And I learned a lesson. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=541.98s)]
*  And then I started Invisible. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=543.26s)]
*  And the first version of Invisible, there was a ton of clients, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=544.7s)]
*  and they were willing to pay us a lot. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=547.6600000000001s)]
*  But we weren't able to supply that demand efficiently. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=549.02s)]
*  And so that version failed. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=551.9s)]
*  And I had to – we had to evolve through that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=553.4200000000001s)]
*  And then we built the first version of the digital assembly line. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=555.34s)]
*  We relaunched in 2017 with that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=558.78s)]
*  And then we had our first small businesses as clients. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=562.7s)]
*  And we got our first medium-sized businesses as clients. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=564.78s)]
*  We got our first enterprise contract in January 2020 with DoorDash. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=566.86s)]
*  And then at that point, I was – I don't know how old I was at the time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=571.5s)]
*  Maybe 30 years old. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=578.86s)]
*  So I'd been through a decade of pain. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=580.78s)]
*  I call it the journey through hell. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=585.98s)]
*  It really is a test of fate. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=587.42s)]
*  And then since then, since January 2020, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=589.1s)]
*  we grew from a one-mill run rate to about a three-mill run rate that year. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=592.7s)]
*  We grew from a three-mill run rate to about a 10-mill run rate the following year. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=596.54s)]
*  We grew from that to a 25-mill run rate the following year. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=600.2199999999999s)]
*  Then a 100-mill run rate the end of last year. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=603.8199999999999s)]
*  And we're shooting for 200 by June next month. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=606.62s)]
*  And by the end of the year, we could be at 300. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=609.5s)]
*  So that is just – [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=611.8199999999999s)]
*  That's epic. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=612.86s)]
*  It is kind of deeply humbling. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=613.5799999999999s)]
*  And to see – first of all, it's several things, right? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=616.62s)]
*  I personally – and I don't think anyone at the company would say, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=620.62s)]
*  we did this through our own genius and our own strength. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=623.98s)]
*  I think that that's the sort of hubris and arrogance that gets you punished, right? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=627.58s)]
*  But certainly, there was a ton of perseverance and team building and great values that went into it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=632.7s)]
*  When you have a strong strategic thesis that you've worked out in writing and you've asked [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  the smartest minds you know to tear it apart and you know all the ways in which it might not be true, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=650.3s)]
*  but you still take a big bet, it's incredible to see when you're right how right you can be and how [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=655.66s)]
*  that plays out. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=661.18s)]
*  And then there is this element of luck, which is kind of miraculous. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=662.06s)]
*  Some of our biggest clients came to us through seemingly random circumstances. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=668.06s)]
*  There was one story where I went through a breakup. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=672.38s)]
*  I was staying with a friend in his guest room and then the next person – he ended up listening to [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=675.82s)]
*  me on Zoom calls and investing and then the next person who stayed in that guest room was a product [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=683.34s)]
*  manager at OpenAI. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=688.7s)]
*  They became a client. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=690.62s)]
*  So those things, nobody can take credit for. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=692.14s)]
*  They're miraculous. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=695.5s)]
*  But then what do you do with the luck? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=697.1s)]
*  Are you prepared for it? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=701.02s)]
*  First of all, I think any entrepreneur listening to this is saying, wow, I mean that is epic [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=703.02s)]
*  growth. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=709.42s)]
*  I mean you hit your stride in the 2020 and this last four years has been extraordinary. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=709.8199999999999s)]
*  And I want to break it down. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=715.9799999999999s)]
*  I want to talk about what Invisible does because it's an amazing asset for companies out there. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=717.9799999999999s)]
*  But I think the lessons that you can teach are really what I want to deliver to this community [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=722.78s)]
*  here. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=729.8199999999999s)]
*  A lot of them. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=732.78s)]
*  So let's begin with number one, capitalizing company. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=733.66s)]
*  You have a different philosophy on raising money. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=739.42s)]
*  I mean most – listen, I'm in the venture capital business through Bold and Expensial Ventures and [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=742.14s)]
*  I have raised a ton of money. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=747.26s)]
*  But my experience in a lot of the big companies that I've gone out to raise money for is I raise [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=748.78s)]
*  capital, raise capital, raise capital and I end up with single digit percent of the company I [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=755.26s)]
*  started and owned 100% of. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=761.58s)]
*  And it's brutal at the end of that. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=764.62s)]
*  There's one exception with one company that I just – I maintained 100% and I built it based upon [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=768.14s)]
*  revenue. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=776.38s)]
*  It's like sold first and then built based upon the revenue I had. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=777.4200000000001s)]
*  Can you talk about your philosophy on raising capital and what you've done with Invisible? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=781.82s)]
*  We call our philosophy the sovereignty game. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=787.0200000000001s)]
*  And it's the venture game versus the sovereignty game. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=789.34s)]
*  So the venture game, which most people in Silicon Valley are familiar with, is you raise a series A, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=791.9s)]
*  then a series B, then a series C and you try to IPO or sell the company in five to eight years. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=798.38s)]
*  And with all that capital, you try to grow as fast as possible. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=804.22s)]
*  You're losing money to grow and take market share and it's a winner take all strategy. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=809.4200000000001s)]
*  And your favorite website is TechCrunch.com. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=814.5400000000001s)]
*  And the company culture is very caffeinated. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=817.58s)]
*  It's like how do we do this as quickly as possible? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=821.58s)]
*  And you're shooting for this big exit. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=824.7s)]
*  And you know that if you don't raise the next round, you might actually go bust [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=828.54s)]
*  because it's a loss-making company. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=831.66s)]
*  So it's very fragile. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=833.98s)]
*  You really need to kind of get very lucky. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=835.42s)]
*  You're dependent on capital markets to agree with you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=840.54s)]
*  And you pretty quickly lose control of your board because these people writing big checks [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=844.8599999999999s)]
*  are taking board seats. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=849.42s)]
*  And so usually by the series A or B, you no longer have real control of your company. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=850.38s)]
*  That's the venture game. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=854.4599999999999s)]
*  The sovereignty game is raise as little capital as possible to get to profitability at scale. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=855.7399999999999s)]
*  We call that escape velocity. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=862.6199999999999s)]
*  And escape velocity has different levels. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=864.78s)]
*  So level negative one, you're losing money, you're burning money. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=866.9399999999999s)]
*  Zero is break even. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=870.8599999999999s)]
*  One is you're making money but not enough money to really optimally reinvest in the company. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=872.78s)]
*  Level two is you're making enough money to optimally reinvest in the company. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=877.82s)]
*  And it's compounding and growing. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=880.94s)]
*  Level three is you're generating capital but not enough to allocate meaningfully. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=882.46s)]
*  And level four is you actually are now generating enough capital to allocate. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=886.46s)]
*  You're a capital allocator and you're compounding. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=889.98s)]
*  And the time horizon is very long in the sovereignty game. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=893.34s)]
*  You're shooting for 20-plus years. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=896.7s)]
*  And so because you've done it capital efficiently, in our case, with $6 million in six years, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=898.94s)]
*  we got to an $11 million revenue run rate generating a million dollars of profit. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=907.34s)]
*  And after that, we were able to just use that profit to keep growing the business. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=912.22s)]
*  And we're now at 25% EBITDA margins. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=915.98s)]
*  So we're shooting for at least a 60 million EBITDA exit run rate for the year, if not higher. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=918.86s)]
*  So that means that we're, and next year, if we hit our targets, we'll generate over 100 million [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=925.5s)]
*  of EBITDA. So we're making a lot of profit per month. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=930.86s)]
*  And that allows us to fuel innovation in the business, to reinvest in the business, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=934.7s)]
*  to start new companies, to invest in companies. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=939.98s)]
*  And someday, it allows us to buy companies. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=943.4200000000001s)]
*  And that's what capital allocators do. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=945.58s)]
*  There's eight buckets in capital allocation. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=947.98s)]
*  You can either keep the cash on balance sheet as insurance for a rainy day. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=950.94s)]
*  You can pay off any debt that you've raised. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=954.7s)]
*  You can reinvest in your business. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=956.7s)]
*  You can start new businesses. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=958.46s)]
*  You can invest in businesses. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=960.1400000000001s)]
*  You can buy businesses. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=961.9000000000001s)]
*  You can do buybacks or dividends. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=963.58s)]
*  And those are the eight buckets. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=965.9000000000001s)]
*  And so the sovereignty game ends up with a very different exit mechanism. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=969.4200000000001s)]
*  So there's five ways equity turns into money. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=974.94s)]
*  Equity turns into money through an IPO, through an M&A, through a dividend, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=977.58s)]
*  through a buyback, or through a secondary. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=983.1s)]
*  The first two are associated with the venture game, IPO and M&A. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=985.74s)]
*  Sell the company or IPO the company. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=989.26s)]
*  The other three are associated with the sovereignty game. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=991.82s)]
*  Either buyback stock, the company's buying back stock from shareholders. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=995.58s)]
*  And this is what SpaceX is doing, right? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=999.02s)]
*  Right. Or secondary, find new investors that want to own shares in the company. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1001.02s)]
*  And you're facilitating a transaction. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1005.4200000000001s)]
*  So one of your shareholders is selling to a new shareholder. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1007.1800000000001s)]
*  And so it's just a transfer of wealth between shareholders. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1010.46s)]
*  And then the third is dividend. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1013.9s)]
*  The company's generating profits and dividends some of it back to shareholders. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1015.42s)]
*  Now, it's interesting. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1019.1s)]
*  Capitalism would be less efficient with any one of the five mechanisms. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1020.46s)]
*  But shareholder capitalism would break without dividends. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1025.42s)]
*  Like, it becomes illogical to have shareholder capitalism if there's not some mechanism [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1029.1s)]
*  of taking profits and distributing them to shareholders. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1034.86s)]
*  That's what makes companies, that's what gives them their intrinsic value, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1037.66s)]
*  their intrinsic financial value. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1041.18s)]
*  And so we are building for that sort of an outcome. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1043.18s)]
*  We've already done, we raised 8 million of primary. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1048.94s)]
*  We've done 20 million of buybacks so far. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1051.74s)]
*  We are about to do another 15 of buybacks. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1055.18s)]
*  And we're working on a $50 million secondary. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1058.3000000000002s)]
*  And so over time, that's our scorecard for realized returns. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1061.5800000000002s)]
*  And we're going to realize more and more returns through buybacks and secondaries. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1065.58s)]
*  And then probably over the next five to 15 years, we might shrink the number of shares [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1069.26s)]
*  by 25 to 50% through buybacks. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1074.3s)]
*  And then at some point, we'll just dividend. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1076.9399999999998s)]
*  And that will be the ultimate return for the company. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1079.1799999999998s)]
*  But the unrealized return is the inherent value of the business over time. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1082.3s)]
*  And so in the sovereignty game, you really have to think through [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1086.46s)]
*  defensibility of the business. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1089.58s)]
*  So if your time horizon is longer, how do you know that the business is even going [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1091.5s)]
*  to be around in 10 years? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1095.34s)]
*  You need a moat. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1096.86s)]
*  And there's a whole theory for how to build a moat around a company. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1097.98s)]
*  And that's the sovereignty game. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1102.78s)]
*  – Take me back to the beginning of this company. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1103.8999999999999s)]
*  You had exited Everest. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1107.4199999999998s)]
*  It didn't work out. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1110.3s)]
*  And what was the inception of Invisible? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1112.78s)]
*  And then how did you early capitalize it? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1117.98s)]
*  What was your, did you dive back in to raise capital for? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1120.6999999999998s)]
*  A new 10-page business plan? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1124.54s)]
*  – Yeah, necessity is the mother of invention. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1126.62s)]
*  I had raised some angel capital for Everest. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1129.1s)]
*  And I was blessed with the generosity of these individuals. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1132.86s)]
*  But when you raise money from individuals, it's their money. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1137.98s)]
*  And so it really hurts to lose it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1140.62s)]
*  And so we'd raised almost $3 million for Everest. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1142.78s)]
*  And it was from people that I really admired, like Peter Thiel, Bono from U2 invested, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1146.3s)]
*  and other great, great individuals. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1152.3s)]
*  And I lost their money. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1154.62s)]
*  And I had to write them a letter and say, I'm sorry, you know, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1156.3s)]
*  I tried my absolute best and the company failed. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1159.26s)]
*  And so when I started this company the second time around, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1161.98s)]
*  I still was very much kind of brainwashed by, you know, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1166.22s)]
*  our sort of like peer pressure, sort of the collective mindset. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1170.3s)]
*  – It's the thing you do. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1173.18s)]
*  – Yeah, it's just the thing you do. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1173.9s)]
*  And the thing is that I got much better at fundraising. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1176.22s)]
*  And so my decks were better. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1179.42s)]
*  My pitch was better. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1181.34s)]
*  And people still didn't want to invest. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1183.58s)]
*  And it was not because they didn't want to invest in me [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1185.34s)]
*  because my first company failed. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1188.3799999999999s)]
*  That was not an issue. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1189.58s)]
*  We were able to raise angel money again pretty quickly. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1190.62s)]
*  But it was because it was a services company. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1193.9s)]
*  And so I ended up realizing that there was a belief, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1197.82s)]
*  a dogmatic belief in my opinion, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1202.62s)]
*  that the institutional investors, the venture capitalists had, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1205.34s)]
*  that you could not build a true technology company [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1208.86s)]
*  that was a services company. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1212.4599999999998s)]
*  And what they wanted to invest in was SaaS, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1214.3799999999999s)]
*  was software as a service. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1217.8999999999999s)]
*  Because software companies that just sell software, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1220.62s)]
*  they have almost like 92% margins, very high margins, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1224.2199999999998s)]
*  and they're very scalable. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1228.2199999999998s)]
*  And so the assumption was this would be a low margin business. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1229.74s)]
*  It would not be scalable. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1232.78s)]
*  And you wouldn't be able to build a moat around it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1235.4199999999998s)]
*  And so as a result, I had to take that feedback [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1239.1s)]
*  really seriously, Peter. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1242.4599999999998s)]
*  And the act of fundraising was actually helpful [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1243.58s)]
*  in getting that feedback from smart people. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1245.9799999999998s)]
*  And I had to think, first of all, if the capital markets [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1249.6599999999999s)]
*  are going to disagree with me, how do I fund the business? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1253.26s)]
*  And then why do I think I'm right? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1257.1s)]
*  And then if I am right, then I'm really right [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1264.3s)]
*  because it's not just Accenture. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  It's McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Ernst & Young, KPMG, Deloitte, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1268.06s)]
*  PwC, WPP, Omnicom, Publisys. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1272.3799999999999s)]
*  The world is run by these 20th century services giants. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1275.8999999999999s)]
*  And for whatever reason, venture capitalists, Silicon Valley, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1280.22s)]
*  the technology industry is not counter positioning against them. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1283.82s)]
*  There's no rebel alliance against that galactic empire. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1287.58s)]
*  They're not being disrupted. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1291.26s)]
*  Silicon Valley is just mass producing tools. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1293.02s)]
*  There's an app for everything. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1295.98s)]
*  Why isn't everything perfect yet? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1297.8999999999999s)]
*  And Invisible's whole idea was customers don't really want to buy more software. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1300.3799999999999s)]
*  They don't really want to figure out how to use more tools in their business. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1306.22s)]
*  They just want operations to run. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1311.26s)]
*  It's complex. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1313.4199999999998s)]
*  They want someone else to do that for them. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1314.22s)]
*  They want someone else to run all these apps, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1315.8999999999999s)]
*  stitch them all together, and deliver the outcome. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1318.3s)]
*  And so I had to get really confident that I was right. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1321.1s)]
*  And then I had to solve that, OK, well, now what do I do? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1325.74s)]
*  How do I finance it? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1327.74s)]
*  And that's when the backward planning began. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1328.94s)]
*  It's like, OK, how much money do I need to get to profitability? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1331.1s)]
*  Because once I'm profitable, I don't need anyone else's money. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1335.1s)]
*  And that's when it's like, OK, $6 million. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1338.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1341.34s)]
*  That's something I can work with. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1342.54s)]
*  And so that's probably something I'm not going to raise all at once. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1344.54s)]
*  I'm probably going to raise it one check at a time. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1348.06s)]
*  And I'm going to go to angel investors and I'm going to tell them the story. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1350.14s)]
*  And maybe I'm going to find a few contrarian institutional investors and get lucky. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1354.54s)]
*  And we were able to find those people. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1360.22s)]
*  About a little more than half of our money came from angels. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1362.06s)]
*  And then the rest came from some seed stage investors. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1364.8600000000001s)]
*  How much did you bring in at that point? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1368.22s)]
*  And it was not all at once. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1370.94s)]
*  So there was like an initial $500,000. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1372.6200000000001s)]
*  And then there was another about $500,000 from angels. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1374.8600000000001s)]
*  And then there was $3 million that came from some seed investors. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1379.1000000000001s)]
*  And then there was a weird million dollar round that half of it came from insiders and half from [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1383.26s)]
*  outsiders. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1389.98s)]
*  And then there was a final million at the very end over a span of years. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1390.86s)]
*  But the other way that I raised money, Peter, was actually I raised money from my own team. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1396.1399999999999s)]
*  Not actually through them investing and writing a check, but because I gave them my equity. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1403.58s)]
*  I created a partnership. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1410.1399999999999s)]
*  And we created a partner pay model with different tiers. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1411.66s)]
*  And tier one would get a certain amount of equity every year. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1415.02s)]
*  And tier two would get a certain amount of equity. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1418.5400000000002s)]
*  And tier three would get a certain amount of equity, et cetera. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1420.22s)]
*  And I convinced everyone who joined the company to take a huge discount to whatever their market [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1423.1000000000001s)]
*  rate was. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1429.74s)]
*  So if they were previously making $200,000 a year, I got people to take even $50 or $70K [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1430.38s)]
*  a year in order to value the equity. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1438.7s)]
*  Now, this was an instant filter. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1440.7s)]
*  The vast majority of people were not interested in taking a huge bet on the equity. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1442.22s)]
*  But when I explained it to some people, they're like, wow, this is very, very generous. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1447.74s)]
*  If this works, this equity is going to be worth millions. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1452.6200000000001s)]
*  And today it is. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1454.94s)]
*  And those people are happy they did the trade. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1455.82s)]
*  And so there was a period of time when basically everyone was in full ramen noodle mode. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1458.8600000000001s)]
*  We were paying each other like $1,000 a month. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1466.14s)]
*  That was the average salary of an invisible partner. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1469.3400000000001s)]
*  But even to this day, when we're paying closer and closer to market, equity is still the [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1473.02s)]
*  biggest portion of compensation. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1477.66s)]
*  Our philosophy is there's cash, your salary for short-term alignment, bonuses and performance [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1479.5s)]
*  milestone pay for medium term. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1488.06s)]
*  Every six months, we do a big bonus round. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1491.66s)]
*  And then there's equity. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1494.78s)]
*  That's the real wealth building exercise at the company. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1496.06s)]
*  Do you think this structure can work for any company out there? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1498.6200000000001s)]
*  Software, services, medical, educational. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1503.18s)]
*  Is this something that can, I mean, it seems like you're aligning interest in an [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1507.26s)]
*  extraordinary fashion. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1511.98s)]
*  And people are thereby doing what they think is best for the company. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1514.8600000000001s)]
*  Everybody has a say in its success. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1522.46s)]
*  In any company in which the alpha is coming from labor, not capital, then this model can [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1524.22s)]
*  and should work and will be deployed and someone will disrupt that industry. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1533.9s)]
*  Then the question is, how many situations is it purely about capital and not about labor? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1537.42s)]
*  And while I'm sure there are some, I think labor is becoming more important, not less [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1546.22s)]
*  important. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1551.18s)]
*  And the assumption has been that actually it's capital that should own most of the [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1551.98s)]
*  stock in the company and labor should maybe own 10 or 20% of the business and capital [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1556.0600000000002s)]
*  should own 80%. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1560.38s)]
*  And my realization over time was, wait a second, my partners are the best investors I have [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1563.5800000000002s)]
*  because they are the people in the business thinking about how to upgrade the business. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1571.1000000000001s)]
*  And yet they're thinking like shareholders. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1576.46s)]
*  They're reading, and we did these finance 101 classes where we teach everyone, here's [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1579.1s)]
*  how an income statement works, here's how a balance sheet works, here's how cash flow works. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1583.58s)]
*  But it forced us to be really transparent and actually it created a kind of internal [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1587.58s)]
*  accountability where it's like, I had to answer tough questions. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1591.58s)]
*  What's our 12-month plan? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1595.98s)]
*  What's our long-term plan? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1597.66s)]
*  How are we going to fix these problems in the business model? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1599.5s)]
*  And it created that sort of internal culture and we call it an owner-operator or an ownership [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1601.8999999999999s)]
*  culture. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1607.9s)]
*  We call each other partners, not employees. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1608.8600000000001s)]
*  I love that. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1611.98s)]
*  I think that can work in pretty much any services business certainly, but then why aren't most [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1612.38s)]
*  venture-backed businesses like this? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1618.7s)]
*  And I think the assumption is, well, the software is doing most of the work, the people are [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1620.3000000000002s)]
*  kind of commodities, what really matters is having the capital to scale it. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1624.94s)]
*  But actually, I think most of the time it's because the board doesn't want to share the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1629.5s)]
*  pie. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1636.22s)]
*  And this is where, you know me, I'm a capitalist. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1637.1799999999998s)]
*  I sound a little bit like, you know, I'm not right now, but I think it's possible to be [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1639.9799999999998s)]
*  both a revolutionary and a good fiduciary. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1645.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's through this alignment of incentives around equity value creation. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1648.9399999999998s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1655.58s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1659.02s)]
*  love. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1664.06s)]
*  The company is called Fountain Life. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1664.3799999999999s)]
*  It's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented physicians. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1666.62s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1672.1399999999999s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1676.54s)]
*  Until that day when you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1678.2199999999998s)]
*  room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1682.62s)]
*  four going on. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1686.9399999999998s)]
*  And, you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1687.9799999999998s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1690.86s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1694.3s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1697.8999999999999s)]
*  We have four across the U.S. today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1703.4199999999998s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1708.06s)]
*  CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1714.54s)]
*  blood workup. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1720.3799999999999s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1721.5s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1724.86s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1731.82s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1734.78s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1736.7s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1738.94s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1741.98s)]

*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1790.4599999999998s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1794.3s)]
*  At early stages during an entrepreneurial journey, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1798.1399999999999s)]
*  an entrepreneur is going to have to figure out how much money they're going to raise. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1801.1799999999998s)]
*  And there is this tendency to say, listen, I'm going to raise more than I think I need [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1805.42s)]
*  because I want the cushion. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1812.8600000000001s)]
*  I want the money in case things turn down or things don't work out. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1814.3s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1819.98s)]
*  I think one of the most important things is living long enough to live forever. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1823.42s)]
*  It's like getting to profitability as soon as you can and then being able to have control [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1826.78s)]
*  over your own fate. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1834.22s)]
*  But I know of companies, I've been inside of ventures where it's like, we need 20 million, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1836.46s)]
*  but let's raise 40 just to have the extra cushion. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1841.74s)]
*  You didn't fall into that trap. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1846.54s)]
*  Sun Tzu said, don't worry about victory. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1849.9s)]
*  Remove the possibility of defeat and then afterwards look for victory. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1853.1000000000001s)]
*  And we used to talk about bunker mode. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1858.3s)]
*  Sometimes people call it cockroach mode. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1860.7s)]
*  Like, do you have a company culture where the resolve, the commitments and the mission [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1862.86s)]
*  is so high that if everyone had to enter ramen mode, if you couldn't pay them and they just [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1869.4199999999998s)]
*  had to go on the equity and you were just giving them stock, the stock that you would [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1878.06s)]
*  otherwise give investors, how many people at your team would stay? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1881.34s)]
*  How many people would keep going and keep working towards the mission? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1885.9799999999998s)]
*  In the early days, that was 100% of our company. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1889.58s)]
*  Today, it's less than 100%. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1893.02s)]
*  Maybe it's only 10% or 20% of our company. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1895.6599999999999s)]
*  It's an abnormally large percentage of our company that still has that company culture. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1898.54s)]
*  But I think that the capital scarcity is a form of forcing you to become efficient. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1904.2199999999998s)]
*  Like when you can't solve problems by hiring people and you can't solve problems by throwing [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1918.78s)]
*  money at the problem, you actually have to innovate your way through the problem. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1924.7s)]
*  And so you end up changing your relationship to the adversity or the scarcity, that is, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1931.82s)]
*  the capital scarcity. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1936.78s)]
*  You end up increasing productivity per person. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1941.9s)]
*  It goes up and up and up and up. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1945.26s)]
*  It might start really slowly. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1947.34s)]
*  You might not even see that it's happening. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1949.02s)]
*  But over time, you look back and you realize, wow, we thought we needed so much capital, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1951.26s)]
*  but we didn't because we ended up solving all these problems along the way and having [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1957.6599999999999s)]
*  these bright ideas. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1961.74s)]
*  We wouldn't have had those bright ideas if our backs weren't up against a wall, so to speak. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1962.86s)]
*  And this is something they teach in martial arts and also in a lot of philosophical traditions, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1969.1799999999998s)]
*  sort of love your enemy. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1973.82s)]
*  Because your enemy is teaching you and the enemy here is capital scarcity. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1974.94s)]
*  You're like, oh, I don't have enough money. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1982.6200000000001s)]
*  And you can be in this very negative mindset about it, but actually can be the greatest [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1984.7s)]
*  gift to your creative process at the company. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1987.9s)]
*  Talk to me a second. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1991.42s)]
*  I'm going to go into hiring and the type of employees. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1992.46s)]
*  But before we get there, talk about span of control and empowering individual employees [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=1995.3400000000001s)]
*  to solve problems versus have large organizational structures and span of control and such. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2001.82s)]
*  I ended up realizing my span was larger than I thought it was. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2010.54s)]
*  The traditional span of control is like you don't want to exceed 12. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2014.78s)]
*  You don't have 12 people working for you. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2020.1399999999999s)]
*  Anything more than that is unmanageable. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2022.62s)]
*  And actually, the sweet spot is usually three to seven. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2025.8999999999999s)]
*  And anything above seven is like danger zone and anything above 12 is impossible. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2030.14s)]
*  Something's wrong. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2033.98s)]
*  But if you have less than three people working for you, then there's not enough. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2035.9s)]
*  And in the creation of a hierarchy, this sort of creates some rules of thumb. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2038.78s)]
*  Those rules of thumb are true if you're operating in what I call an army mindset. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2044.7s)]
*  If you're operating in a special forces mindset, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2052.3s)]
*  you can sort of do these very strange dances. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2055.82s)]
*  For example, we hired a CEO, Ben. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2068.46s)]
*  He started about 18 months ago. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2071.9s)]
*  And at one point, he had a span of control of 17. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2073.98s)]
*  And I was cool with it because I felt like he was such a capable manager [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2077.42s)]
*  that he was actually able to empower that many people. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2084.62s)]
*  There was a medium-term strategy to hire some key people that are actually now [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2088.06s)]
*  condensing the span of control. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2095.74s)]
*  So his span of control is rationalizing now. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2097.1s)]
*  But for this sprint, this particular period of time, he was capable and it was necessary to do that. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2099.42s)]
*  And why was it possible? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2107.66s)]
*  It was possible because I had a dotted line to most of those people. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2110.86s)]
*  And I was co-managing and I was helping him manage it. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2114.78s)]
*  And we also were able to surround ourselves with the right advisors and board members [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2118.3s)]
*  that were helping him. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2123.1800000000003s)]
*  And there were enough veterans in the business that their [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2124.46s)]
*  veterans was able to sort of upgrade the new people we were hiring pretty fast. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2127.5s)]
*  And so it held together. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2132.3s)]
*  And so I think that in an army mindset, you kind of look for a job description with clear check boxes. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2135.26s)]
*  And you're done when you're done checking those boxes. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2143.6600000000003s)]
*  But in more of a special forces mindset, everyone is capable of doing more than they think they can. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2146.78s)]
*  And the combinations, the ways in which you can combine people, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2153.42s)]
*  it's much more like soccer than baseball. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2159.1800000000003s)]
*  It's much more fluid. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2161.9s)]
*  And you can only move into that fluidity when everyone is really committed to excellence [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2164.1400000000003s)]
*  and everyone is in an open-minded state. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2169.6600000000003s)]
*  But I just think that... [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2172.3s)]
*  I want to go someplace different with this because I think the kind of company you've [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2173.9s)]
*  been building is one in which... [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2177.98s)]
*  So backing up a second, going to a company like Lockheed, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2180.78s)]
*  I remember reading about Lockheed's Gunk Works and the way it worked, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2184.2200000000003s)]
*  the level of agility was such that in the center of the massive hanger when they were building [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2190.3s)]
*  their aircraft, they had a single blueprint and anyone could go and make a change to that blueprint. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2199.5s)]
*  They were empowered to do that, but they had to write their name next to the change. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2204.78s)]
*  In other words, as long as they felt were clear and responsible, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2210.0600000000004s)]
*  they didn't have to go through layers of approvals to go and make that edit. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2216.06s)]
*  So how do you create a culture in which... [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2220.94s)]
*  Because you've got owner partners and people care deeply about it, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2223.82s)]
*  that there isn't layers of red tape to encourage people to optimize and solve, right? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2232.06s)]
*  Because when you have so much structure and you have all these approval processes, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2240.06s)]
*  you crush an organization's agility. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2245.1s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2249.2599999999998s)]
*  I totally agree with that. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2250.2999999999997s)]
*  One is just shifting the emphasis from sins of omission, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2252.06s)]
*  sins of commission to sins of omission, right? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2257.02s)]
*  So you're less going to get punished for making mistakes and you're more [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2259.2599999999998s)]
*  going to get punished for not doing stuff. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2262.38s)]
*  And so one way to see if a company is becoming more political, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2264.38s)]
*  which we have to fight against right now, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2269.9s)]
*  is people are afraid of putting their name on things. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2271.9s)]
*  You talked about putting your name on the blueprint, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2275.66s)]
*  but even putting your name on an email and writing an email and saying, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2278.06s)]
*  for example, I woke up this morning, somebody on the team said, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2281.02s)]
*  we don't have a day one mindset on this part of our sales team. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2288.3s)]
*  And he listed out a whole bunch of problems and he had escalated it. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2293.34s)]
*  And he could have, by causing a stink, maybe you're putting yourself at risk. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2296.14s)]
*  Maybe you're putting your job at risk. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2305.58s)]
*  We really don't punish that. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2307.2599999999998s)]
*  We reward that. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2308.62s)]
*  That's somebody who's taking ownership and responsibility [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2309.58s)]
*  and calling out a problem. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2312.46s)]
*  So I think we just generally reward people who take on more responsibility [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2317.2599999999998s)]
*  and who are willing to identify problems and not just identify problems, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2322.2999999999997s)]
*  but suggest solutions and give the solutions a try. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2326.3799999999997s)]
*  Even when the solutions don't work, I'd rather have that person who's taking risks [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2329.3399999999997s)]
*  running things than the person who's not taking risks. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2335.8999999999996s)]
*  And it's the person who's not saying stuff, who's quiet, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2338.7799999999997s)]
*  who doesn't put their neck out there. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2341.74s)]
*  That's the person who's like basically bureaucratic and political [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2343.4199999999996s)]
*  and probably just a follower. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2346.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2349.02s)]
*  Hiring people. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2350.22s)]
*  How do you hire people? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2350.8599999999997s)]
*  How do you find them? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2352.06s)]
*  You said you have 3,000 individuals now as part of the team. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2353.74s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2356.94s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2358.62s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2359.58s)]
*  How do you talk about culture and hiring and what you're thought to? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2361.98s)]
*  What have you learned there? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2366.54s)]
*  Yeah, we've learned a lot of things. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2368.62s)]
*  The structure of the organization is we have partners at the top [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2370.14s)]
*  and they have equity in the business. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2374.62s)]
*  We started the year with about 120 partners. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2376.14s)]
*  We're going to end the year with nearly 300. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2378.38s)]
*  So we're more than doubling headcount this year, which is very scary [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2380.62s)]
*  in the sense that it's a test of the culture if the veterans can bring in the new people. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2385.98s)]
*  And then there's specialists. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2393.98s)]
*  The specialists are partners in training and they haven't made partner yet. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2397.5s)]
*  They don't have equity yet, but they're working on both the partners [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2402.38s)]
*  and the specialists are building the company. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2405.42s)]
*  And then the agents are doing the work for the clients on the digital assembly line. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2407.74s)]
*  And that could be advanced AI training work. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2414.22s)]
*  It could be building spreadsheets. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2416.46s)]
*  It could be running insurance claims. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2417.98s)]
*  It could be any form of work that our clients need. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2419.58s)]
*  And these are contractors and they're in over 100 countries around the world. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2422.22s)]
*  And the ability to scalably hire people, train them, manage them, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2427.18s)]
*  they can sort of set up their shift schedule and then our system will [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2432.78s)]
*  automatically route them work that they're qualified to do. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2436.3s)]
*  And we create an interface for them to do it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2439.26s)]
*  And we have a quality system to check the work and then they get paid in their local currency. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2441.1000000000004s)]
*  Some of them get paid in Bitcoin. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2447.1000000000004s)]
*  And so those are the contractors. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2451.26s)]
*  Amazingly, even in the contractor, even in the agent workforce that we have, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2452.94s)]
*  the company's, the partnership's values have spread down. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2460.86s)]
*  And so I'd say actually a lot of our agents have that partner ethos, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2465.1s)]
*  even though they're not partner yet. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2470.86s)]
*  And a lot of them dream of becoming a partner someday. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2472.14s)]
*  And we try to create paths for them upwards. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2474.14s)]
*  We'll be at probably over 5,000 by the end of the year, Peter, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2478.78s)]
*  just to give you a sense of how the organization is growing quickly when you count the agents. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2481.42s)]
*  But the partners are the ones I really watch. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2487.5s)]
*  And one of the key evolutions that I'm thinking about now is in the early days, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2493.18s)]
*  it was possible for a new partner to earn more than 1% of Invisible. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2498.7799999999997s)]
*  Now, if we hit our targets over the next five years, 1% of Invisible, we were worth $100 million. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2504.54s)]
*  And so people are chasing basis points. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2511.98s)]
*  And you have people that are shooting to earn 10 basis points because they believe that'll be worth [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2515.58s)]
*  $10 million in five years. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2520.38s)]
*  It's a life-changing amount of money. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2522.2200000000003s)]
*  I worry that that would change the shareholder, investor, owner-operator, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2526.46s)]
*  the investor-operator culture that we have. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2532.2200000000003s)]
*  So far, it's holding. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2535.98s)]
*  Every time I meet a new partner, I'm thinking in the back of my mind, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2539.1s)]
*  does this person think like an entrepreneur? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2542.1400000000003s)]
*  Do they take risks? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2544.86s)]
*  Can they understand how one puzzle piece of the tactics they're working on in a day-to-day [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2546.62s)]
*  basis fit into the overall strategic puzzle of the business? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2553.18s)]
*  Do they understand the strategy? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2557.98s)]
*  And so far, I'm incredibly blown away. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2560.2999999999997s)]
*  And I think the secret has been, Peter, we built a hiring team as if it was its own separate business. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2564.2999999999997s)]
*  So if Invisible is operations as a service, our hiring team is hiring as a service. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2571.58s)]
*  And the head of hiring, Mark Gray, is this half Turkish, half Irish guy who lives in Copenhagen. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2578.14s)]
*  He married a Danish lady. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2585.1s)]
*  And he had been a scale-up head of hiring. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2586.94s)]
*  And we gave him an opportunity to say, hey, come here. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2590.38s)]
*  You'll be our head of hiring. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2592.7s)]
*  But instead of just running a cost center, we're going to treat you like you're a CEO. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2594.06s)]
*  And we're going to give you an actual path to become a CEO of your own business. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2600.22s)]
*  And your first client will be Invisible. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2604.7s)]
*  And Invisible needs a hiring factory that can produce higher and higher quantity and higher [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2607.3399999999997s)]
*  and higher quality of all these types of people. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2615.18s)]
*  And we need to do everything from hiring engineers to hiring executives to hiring [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2616.8599999999997s)]
*  managers to hiring agents who do work for clients that are operational. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2621.66s)]
*  And we need to do all of that. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2625.74s)]
*  That is a full agency, effectively, that we need to build. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2627.98s)]
*  And so the only way to do it is through incredible amounts of automation and innovation. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2631.5s)]
*  And you need to have your small team not think like they're a small part of a big thing, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2635.42s)]
*  but think like they're a big part of a small thing. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2642.2200000000003s)]
*  Can you do it? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2644.2200000000003s)]
*  And he was up for the mission. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2644.86s)]
*  He was the most entrepreneurial person we interviewed. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2646.54s)]
*  I turned down five other candidates because I knew that a good head of hiring [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2649.26s)]
*  is a good hire that makes good hires. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2655.1s)]
*  It's like an extra good hire. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2657.26s)]
*  And a bad head of hiring is like a bad hire that makes bad hires. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2658.86s)]
*  And so you tank your culture. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2661.42s)]
*  So when we hired Mark Gray, it really was a huge piece of leverage for the company. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2662.86s)]
*  Last year, we had over 100,000 people apply. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2668.1400000000003s)]
*  We only hired 1,000. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2670.6200000000003s)]
*  And so that's like 1%. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2672.2200000000003s)]
*  And our cost per hiring an agent was only $87. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2673.9s)]
*  And our cost per hiring a partner was about $150. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2677.7400000000002s)]
*  And we were able to do that because they automated so much of the outbound [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2681.1800000000003s)]
*  and of the full in our applicant tracking system, Greenhouse. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2686.3s)]
*  They automated like every single process in Greenhouse. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2689.7400000000002s)]
*  And they used a bunch of psyche valves to like basically use data from all the interviews [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2693.02s)]
*  that we were getting and use that to accelerate the process. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2698.54s)]
*  My friend, you have opened up a thousand conversational doors here in just the last two minutes. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2702.38s)]
*  I mean, so first of all, you've built a completely [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2707.5800000000004s)]
*  virtualized organization with individuals in how many countries? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2712.46s)]
*  Over 100. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2716.38s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2717.26s)]
*  It was 96 when we were at abundance 360 and it's over 100 now. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2717.9s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2721.42s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2721.98s)]
*  And we'll come back to your nomadic lifestyle in a little bit because you're circumnavigating [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2722.46s)]
*  the globe on a constant basis. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2726.86s)]
*  But at the same time, what you just said was turning what was a cost center into a [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2729.5800000000004s)]
*  potential significant profit center. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2736.86s)]
*  And you're looking at iterating on that over and over again. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2739.1800000000003s)]
*  You have this tree structure of what invisible, can you describe your vision of where invisible [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2742.86s)]
*  is going in terms of the baby companies that you're spawning in the process? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2748.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2753.9s)]
*  Well, let's just complete the story with Mark and then we'll go to the demo. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2755.9s)]
*  I want to give it abundance 360. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2758.7s)]
*  So he's starting Zero Hiring. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2762.2200000000003s)]
*  We own zerohiring.com. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2764.14s)]
*  We're getting ready to launch. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2765.66s)]
*  And I met this guy about a year ago, this guy named Sam Gibson, who was a British guy, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2767.5s)]
*  and he had built and sold an RPO company, a recruitment process outsourcing company. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2775.66s)]
*  And he had made meaningful return on that business, but he was an entrepreneur that [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2782.9399999999996s)]
*  still felt like the industry should be disrupted. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2793.18s)]
*  So I introduced him to Mark Gray and Mark hired him to basically build our external revenue. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2795.34s)]
*  So by the end of the year, I think we're going to do $3 million run rate from our [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2801.58s)]
*  hiring as a service business from external clients. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2806.38s)]
*  So Invisible is no longer the only client of Mark and his team. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2809.26s)]
*  They have revenue and it's already profitable. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2814.94s)]
*  And so I'm pushing them to scale that business because next year, by the end of the year, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2818.3s)]
*  they could be at 10 million plus revenue. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2823.5s)]
*  And then they should be able to grow at 100% plus growth rates for many years until they're [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2826.38s)]
*  over 100 mil run rate. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2831.26s)]
*  And so the demo I want to give it abundance 360. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2833.58s)]
*  And I don't know if we'll be ready by next year, but if not, it'll be the year after. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2836.94s)]
*  I want to go on stage and take Sam Altman's thing that he talks about, which I've been [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2842.94s)]
*  talking about for a decade too, is the one person unicorn. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2847.82s)]
*  Could you have one person or a very, very small team build a billion dollar business [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2851.58s)]
*  without having to hire a huge finance team, a huge sales team, a huge operations team, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2857.6600000000003s)]
*  a huge marketing team, a huge people team? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2862.86s)]
*  And I would love to be able to build a business in an hour on stage. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2866.3s)]
*  And we can source the idea from the audience by the domain and then basically create, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2870.1400000000003s)]
*  delegate all the operations to Invisible. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2876.3s)]
*  And we'll have hiring as a service run by zero. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2881.26s)]
*  And we have basically a consulting business called Descendancy that's our McKinsey, Bain, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2884.94s)]
*  BCG competitor. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2892.94s)]
*  So that'll run all the strategy in the advisor program and shareholder relations. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2894.2200000000003s)]
*  We're building a marketing and design agency called RAD. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2898.3s)]
*  So RAD will do all, it will be our marketing team and our design team. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2900.94s)]
*  And we have a few more that we're incubating. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2904.14s)]
*  Eventually we'll have sales as a service and finance as a service. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2907.5s)]
*  Unlimited Financial Services will be the name of, we just hired the CEO for that. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2911.74s)]
*  And that'll be our KPMG, PwC, Deloitte, and EY competitor. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2917.74s)]
*  And so you'll basically have all the functions of your business outsourced. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2923.5s)]
*  And you won't need to hire anyone other than the core team generating the core IP that are truly [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2928.94s)]
*  asymmetric, nonlinear, high leverage founders. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2936.46s)]
*  And I think this will create a new era in entrepreneurship because it will change [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2939.7400000000002s)]
*  the idea of what it means to be on a team. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2949.02s)]
*  So right now the assumption is if you're only on a team, if you are a full-time W2 employee, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2951.82s)]
*  but what if we hold this as our standard of excellence as a vendor is when our clients [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2959.34s)]
*  forget that we're not on their team. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2966.2200000000003s)]
*  We are so integrated in their company and their processes, when we're so aware of their [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2971.02s)]
*  strategy and their goals and their OKRs, when we're able to add that kind of nonlinear value [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2977.5s)]
*  that they're like, yeah, Invisible's on the team. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2983.02s)]
*  Like, you know, that's, I think, how Grace feels at OpenAI. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2984.86s)]
*  Like, she's on the team. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2988.54s)]
*  So that's the goal is like, what if the majority of your team members are actually vendors [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2990.2200000000003s)]
*  and you don't even care? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=2998.7000000000003s)]
*  It's just osmotic. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3000.06s)]
*  Right now, only 10% of work is outsourced. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3001.9s)]
*  By the end of the century, I think it could be 50 to 90%. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3005.7400000000002s)]
*  It's the speed, the speed of innovation, the speed of creation, the speed of problem-solving, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3008.7s)]
*  the agility. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3014.9399999999996s)]
*  If you were going to go back in time to the Francis I met 15 years ago, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3018.7799999999997s)]
*  you're just getting started on Everest and give yourself the most, you know, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3026.2999999999997s)]
*  distilled advice you could do. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3034.22s)]
*  What would that be? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3036.7s)]
*  You're like, have you find me some time to think? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3044.9399999999996s)]
*  Have you asked yourself this question? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3047.58s)]
*  Like, what would you give young Peter? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3049.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm going to let you mess up the multiverse. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3050.9399999999996s)]
*  Like, would you, would you create a consequence? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3053.8199999999997s)]
*  Let me answer that question. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3057.02s)]
*  Let me answer that question. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3058.3799999999997s)]
*  So I think, first of all, young Peter went after medicine to make his parents happy versus [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3059.58s)]
*  what I wanted to do, right, early on, which was space. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3070.62s)]
*  I want to jokingly say, you know, buy Apple and Amazon and Google early on when it's, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3076.8599999999997s)]
*  but I think it was really focused on the core business and building something that is [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3083.18s)]
*  profitable and generating value and create something that's real versus building pie in [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3095.98s)]
*  the sky. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3106.06s)]
*  My early ventures in space were such, you know, insert $100 million here and work on something [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3106.88s)]
*  for a long time and eventually build it versus start generating real business and revenue on day [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3113.84s)]
*  one and then build upon a profitable ongoing business. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3122.24s)]
*  It's one of the biggest challenges in the space business, the amount of capital required to get [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3126.88s)]
*  to a point where you're actually able to achieve, you know, orbital velocity, so to speak. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3131.04s)]
*  And that was a very, very different. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3135.6s)]
*  So how do you balance that moonshot desire at the same time that you want to build a real business [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3138.16s)]
*  early, right? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3145.92s)]
*  In that juxtapositioning, for me, I finally got clarity about you need to get, you know, get to [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3146.96s)]
*  revenue early, start a team that's working together and generating capital and generating [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3154.96s)]
*  profits and then get a clear roadmap from there to your moonshot. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3161.68s)]
*  But don't start at the full moonshot level. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3167.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3171.6s)]
*  For me, that was an important insight. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3172.7999999999997s)]
*  How about you? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3175.6s)]
*  What was it? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3176.9599999999996s)]
*  What failure lessons, what lessons would you bring back? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3177.7599999999998s)]
*  So I mentor and invest in, we started an investing program and we'll get to that in a second. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3182.3999999999996s)]
*  Visionary Ventures is the name of our investment arm. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3188.72s)]
*  And as we're starting to invest in other entrepreneurs and I'm starting to mentor [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3191.6s)]
*  younger entrepreneurs, I'm finding myself in this strange position of giving advice. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3195.52s)]
*  But I still think of myself as a white belt and as a beginner. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3201.3599999999997s)]
*  I hope I never lose that. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3206.72s)]
*  You want to be in a beginner state of mind all the time to really perceive the world and learn the [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3208.0s)]
*  lessons that are all around us all the time. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3212.72s)]
*  And then, like a good college essayist, I'm going to challenge the premise of the question, which is [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3214.48s)]
*  if I had, even if I gave myself almost like a I know Kung Fu matrix download and I could somehow [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3219.84s)]
*  download all the things I've learned in the last 15 years, that would kick off another branch in [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3227.76s)]
*  the multiverse, right? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3232.88s)]
*  It would create a parallel universe where that Francis would go off to do different things. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3233.84s)]
*  And there's something beautiful about the adversities, the challenges that we're going [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3237.84s)]
*  to face, the adversities, the tragedies, the things that I thought were so terrible at the [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3242.8799999999997s)]
*  time, like my first business failing, right? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3248.7999999999997s)]
*  I was really beat up about that. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3252.3199999999997s)]
*  But actually, it was one of the best things that ever happened to me. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3254.16s)]
*  Or us, Invisible, failing to raise a Series A because VCs thought it could never become [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3257.68s)]
*  a scalable company. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3262.16s)]
*  That was also one of the best things that could have ever happened to business. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3263.3599999999997s)]
*  No way that we'd be 70% owned by the team. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3267.12s)]
*  And so you sort of mess up the butterfly and the cocoon, needs to struggle to become the [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3269.76s)]
*  butterfly. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3277.28s)]
*  It's cliche, but it's true. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3277.6800000000003s)]
*  That being said, I have three books that I recommend entrepreneurs read. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3279.84s)]
*  These are like our three business Bibles. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3284.0800000000004s)]
*  The first is Outsiders by Will Thorndyke. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3287.1200000000003s)]
*  And he was the last investor in our company. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3290.1600000000003s)]
*  And he studied Berkshire Hathaway. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3292.1600000000003s)]
*  He studied seven other companies, General Dynamics, Washington Post, a company called [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3294.48s)]
*  Teledyne. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3301.2000000000003s)]
*  And these are companies most people have never heard of. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3302.48s)]
*  And the first page is a stock chart comparing their collective performance to the S&P 500 [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3304.96s)]
*  over time and to the most famous CEO that everyone had heard of, Jack Welsh, and his [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3312.56s)]
*  performance over time. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3316.8s)]
*  And it's just like a hands down, no contest, crush fest. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3318.1600000000003s)]
*  Like they absolutely crushed it. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3321.52s)]
*  And he says the way they did it is they understood how to generate capital and increase [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3323.7599999999998s)]
*  capital generation in their businesses over time. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3327.68s)]
*  And they understood how to allocate capital. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3330.0s)]
*  And he doesn't call it the sovereignty game, but basically most of the principles of what [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3332.56s)]
*  we've codified as the sovereignty game are in that book. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3336.88s)]
*  And so I think from reading that book and from our other experiences, we're trying to [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3340.88s)]
*  extend it and write the sequel, so to speak. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3346.08s)]
*  And that's why we have more and more clarity on what the sovereignty game looks like. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3348.16s)]
*  But none of the businesses that he talks about in that book are technology companies. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3352.32s)]
*  And so when I was first introduced to Mr. Thorndyke, that was my pitch. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3356.4s)]
*  It's like I want to build the first sovereignty game business in the technology industry. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3364.2400000000002s)]
*  And so that's the first book. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3369.76s)]
*  The second book is Seven Powers by Hamilton Helmer. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3371.04s)]
*  And this is a book about how to defend a business from competition. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3374.96s)]
*  And the seven powers are scale economies, network effects, switching costs, cornered [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3378.72s)]
*  resources, counter positioning, process power, and branding. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3386.16s)]
*  And a business can, in theory, develop all the powers. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3391.8399999999997s)]
*  But what really matters is which one you're going to be able to get to first. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3396.0s)]
*  And if you can phase into power before your competitors, you have a barrier. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3400.3999999999996s)]
*  And he makes you very aware that we usually talk about benefits. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3405.12s)]
*  There's so many benefits to using Invisible. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3410.56s)]
*  But what actually matters is barriers, which is why can't people solve that problem themselves [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3412.7999999999997s)]
*  or use some other company to solve that problem? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3419.7599999999998s)]
*  Why do they need to use you? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3421.7599999999998s)]
*  Why are you the only source of that supply? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3423.04s)]
*  And those barriers end up creating the enterprise value over time. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3425.2799999999997s)]
*  And he tells some great stories. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3428.3199999999997s)]
*  And the Netflix blockbuster story is one of the main ones that really stuck with me. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3430.24s)]
*  And then the third is Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton Christensen. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3435.12s)]
*  And the Innovator's Dilemma is of the three books. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3441.92s)]
*  It's actually the most subtle and nuanced of the books because the Innovator's Dilemma [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3446.0s)]
*  shows up in a whole bunch of different ways. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3450.4s)]
*  And a really good example is actually Infinity. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3452.96s)]
*  So you asked me earlier, what does our corporate structure look like? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3455.52s)]
*  Our corporate structure is basically my sort of PhD thesis about how to solve the Innovator's [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3458.48s)]
*  Dilemma. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3466.96s)]
*  That is the challenge that we're trying to solve as a company because we don't want to [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3467.6800000000003s)]
*  lose the entrepreneurial magic and we don't want to stop doing zero to one innovation [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3471.76s)]
*  as we scale. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3475.52s)]
*  But scale is the enemy of innovation in most companies. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3476.88s)]
*  And so you can understand how this works from a numbers perspective, actually. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3480.0s)]
*  If by the end of the year we hit our targets and we're at a 250 to 300 mil run rate, and [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3485.2s)]
*  these new businesses, I started an incubator called Infinity last January, and the incubator [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3492.56s)]
*  is a business and there are seven businesses inside of it. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3501.4399999999996s)]
*  And each of them has CEOs. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3503.7599999999998s)]
*  And by the end of this year, collectively, they're tracking for $10 million run rate. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3505.52s)]
*  But that's only one, that is like 3% of the overall group revenues or less. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3510.88s)]
*  It's such a small percentage of the overall revenue, seemingly it doesn't matter. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3519.68s)]
*  But every year you play out the story, this incredible dynamic occurs. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3525.68s)]
*  So Invisible's growth rate, because of physics, will slow down even if we can't do it. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3530.96s)]
*  It will slow down even if we continue growing at an incredible rate. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3537.92s)]
*  Because let's just say next year we grow to 500 million of revenue and the year after that we [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3542.32s)]
*  grow to 850 and the year after that we go to 1.2. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3547.04s)]
*  The year after that we go to 1.6 and 1.9. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3550.56s)]
*  Eventually you slow down your growth rate over time. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3554.2400000000002s)]
*  As long as you, like last year we were at 300%, this year 150 was the goal. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3557.04s)]
*  Next year 100 is the goal. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3563.12s)]
*  Then it becomes 80 and 70 and 60 and 50 and 40 and 30. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3564.4s)]
*  As long as you stay above 25, you're actually in legendary performance territory [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3568.0s)]
*  if you can maintain that over 20 years. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3573.28s)]
*  That's what Apple did, Amazon did, Berkshire did, all the companies that you've heard of [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3576.8s)]
*  as legendary businesses, they stayed at 25% plus compounding over decades. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3581.04s)]
*  And that's why my favorite website is mathisfun.com [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3586.2400000000002s)]
*  compound interest calculator. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3590.32s)]
*  If you really play with the compound interest calculator, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3591.92s)]
*  it's mind blowing what 25% does over 20 years. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3594.2400000000002s)]
*  These new infinity companies, even though they're only like 2% of our revenues this year, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3599.52s)]
*  next year they're going to grow at over 100%. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3605.52s)]
*  They're going to stay at over 100% a lot longer. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3607.92s)]
*  As the big business matures and the growth rate slows down, the small businesses will be able to [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3611.84s)]
*  stay at hyper growth, super high growth rates and we'll be able to piggyback on the success [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3617.12s)]
*  of the big business, which will lift the group average. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3620.96s)]
*  But the only way you can do that zero to one innovation is you have to have separate [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3624.2400000000002s)]
*  structures. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3630.64s)]
*  You have to put people in separate boxes, you have to ring fence them and create these [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3632.0s)]
*  separate businesses with separate cap tables. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3637.12s)]
*  And so the way we've done it is the CEO of a new company inside of our incubator gets a path [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3639.28s)]
*  to owning 25% of that business. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3646.0s)]
*  The team, the employee stock option pool, has a path to 25%. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3648.48s)]
*  We, for the first 5 million into the business, are getting 50% of the business [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3653.28s)]
*  and control over the business and we're networking all these businesses together. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3657.6800000000003s)]
*  There are AirPods, iPhone, iPad, MacBook. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3661.36s)]
*  It's operations as a service, hiring as a service, strategy as a service, sales as a service, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3665.2000000000003s)]
*  finance as a service. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3670.48s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3671.6s)]
*  But that structure allows those, that board, that CEO, that team to focus on growing that business [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3673.6s)]
*  without too much interference or distraction from this big company and it gives them the [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3682.88s)]
*  resources they need. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3687.92s)]
*  If we try to do that sort of innovation inside of the big company, they would be crushed. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3689.44s)]
*  They would not get any time, any attention, any energy, any money. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3695.2s)]
*  What a waste. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3701.04s)]
*  What a missed opportunity. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3701.68s)]
*  When you're dealing with too much opportunity, there's one solution which I think is the [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3703.84s)]
*  sort of amateur solution which is focus. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3709.6s)]
*  Just pick one of the many opportunities and just focus on that because it's big enough. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3712.24s)]
*  But the real pro move which Christiansen gets at is set up separate businesses and each one [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3716.88s)]
*  of those businesses should focus. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3723.28s)]
*  But that actually allows you to achieve the meta goal of going after the entire opportunity. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3725.6s)]
*  Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3732.0s)]
*  If you did, did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Labs, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3734.1600000000003s)]
*  that they spent billions on bio-defense weapons, the ability to accurately detect [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3740.96s)]
*  viruses and microbes by reading their RNA? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3746.48s)]
*  Well, a company called Viome exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos Labs [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3749.6s)]
*  to build a platform that can measure your microbiome and the RNA in your blood. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3754.88s)]
*  Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called Full Body Intelligence, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3760.56s)]
*  which collects a few drops of your blood, spit, and stool, and can tell you so much about your [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3765.04s)]
*  health. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3769.6800000000003s)]
*  They've tested over 700,000 individuals and used their AI models to deliver members critical [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3770.2400000000002s)]
*  health guidance like what foods you should eat, what foods you shouldn't eat, as well [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3775.6800000000003s)]
*  as your supplements and probiotics, your biological age, and other deep health insights. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3780.0s)]
*  And the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3785.92s)]
*  As reported in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, after just six months of following [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3789.44s)]
*  Viome's recommendations, members reported the following. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3794.56s)]
*  A 36% reduction in depression, a 40% reduction in anxiety, a 30% reduction in diabetes, and [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3797.68s)]
*  a 48% reduction in IBS. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3805.84s)]
*  Listen, I've been using Viome for three years. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3808.48s)]
*  I know that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3810.64s)]
*  Best of all, Viome is affordable, which is part of my mission to democratize health. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3815.7599999999998s)]

*  I've asked Naveen Jain, a friend of mine who's the founder and CEO of Viome, to give my listeners [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3824.88s)]
*  a special discount. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3829.44s)]
*  You'll find it at Viome.com slash Peter. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3830.72s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3834.8s)]
*  I love that. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3836.96s)]
*  And it's true. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3839.2s)]
*  And for a entrepreneur who is itching to be creative and to generate, it's a way of scratching [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3840.48s)]
*  that itch on your part, but having someone who's absolutely focused on the success of [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3849.2000000000003s)]
*  that core business. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3855.6000000000004s)]
*  I want to talk about your lifestyle, Francis. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3858.56s)]
*  It's pretty extraordinary. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3862.4s)]
*  Share with folks what it's like to be here. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3863.7599999999998s)]
*  You're taking the role of founder and chairman, and Ben Plummer has taken the role of CEO. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3868.08s)]
*  Was that easy to pull a CEO in? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3875.04s)]
*  But before that, I'll speak to you. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3877.6s)]
*  One moment you're in Southeast Asia, the next moment you're in Europe, now you're up in [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3881.2s)]
*  Vancouver. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3886.0s)]
*  Do you own a home? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3887.8399999999997s)]
*  No. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3889.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3890.7400000000002s)]
*  I was living in New York, and then I put all my stuff in storage, and I became a nomad [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3891.1400000000003s)]
*  about a year ago. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3895.2200000000003s)]
*  And I'm in a new city almost every week, and I'm going where the business is, which is [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3897.38s)]
*  everywhere. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3903.7000000000003s)]
*  So there are opportunities in all these places. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3904.9s)]
*  There are so many great companies in Vancouver. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3907.94s)]
*  Lululemon's in Vancouver, Arc'teryx is in Vancouver, Slack is in Vancouver, Hootsuite [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3910.6600000000003s)]
*  is in Vancouver. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3915.38s)]
*  There's some new unicorns in the city. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3916.34s)]
*  If you come here and you get introduced to the right people and you host a dinner, like [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3918.18s)]
*  we had a wonderful dinner on Sunday night with deep conversations I'll never forget, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3931.2999999999997s)]
*  and now I'm going to be friends with these people hopefully for the rest of my life. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3935.2999999999997s)]
*  And then I'll keep coming back, and over time a community forms. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3939.54s)]
*  We've been building these communities on WhatsApp. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3945.22s)]
*  We call them mafias. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3947.38s)]
*  So we have our Vancouver mafia now. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3948.42s)]
*  We have our New York City mafia. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3950.58s)]
*  It has like 300 people in it. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3951.94s)]
*  And it's like a private social network we've built on WhatsApp. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3954.1800000000003s)]
*  And we also have been adding our friends to business syndicates. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3958.1800000000003s)]
*  So we added all of our investor friends to our investor syndicate, and they share deals. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3962.6600000000003s)]
*  We add all our entrepreneur friends to our entrepreneur syndicate. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3966.58s)]
*  We have a longevity syndicate. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3969.2200000000003s)]
*  We have an AI syndicate. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3970.98s)]
*  And these are our networks that we're building over time. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3972.42s)]
*  And it's a way of creating culture when you have a fully remote company with no office. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3976.1s)]
*  If you think about what it would have been like to build a business like this in the 1980s, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3983.14s)]
*  I would be probably on Wall Street or something with an actual office. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3987.86s)]
*  And the way you know that you're making progress is that you're upgrading to a [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3993.38s)]
*  fancier and fancier office, and you have more and more floors in the building. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=3997.2999999999997s)]
*  You can actually meet all the people and shake their hands. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4000.98s)]
*  And the way I know this is real is I'm in Buenos Aires, and we have 111 people. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4004.1800000000003s)]
*  And I've never been to Buenos Aires before, but all these people share our values, share the mission. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4009.38s)]
*  I talk to them. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4014.7400000000002s)]
*  I hear their stories. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4015.62s)]
*  And that's how I know it's real is because I get dinner with them in person and not just on Zoom. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4016.58s)]
*  And so, yeah, we have partners in all these places, agents in all these places, clients in all these [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4022.58s)]
*  places, and then advisors and board members and friends and allies in all these places. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4030.34s)]
*  So I think of it as sort of like a global remote work phenomenon, this new nomadic [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4035.46s)]
*  lifestyle as possible. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4043.7000000000003s)]
*  And then I'm also having fun adventures. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4045.94s)]
*  Like I went scuba diving in Costa Rica. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4048.0200000000004s)]
*  I invited my parents. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4053.46s)]
*  You know, if you don't live anywhere, the people that you love, your friends, your family, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4055.14s)]
*  they come to you. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4060.5s)]
*  And then you take your mom and dad scuba diving for the first time. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4061.86s)]
*  Or somebody, one of our board members and one of our clients are big mountaineers. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4065.38s)]
*  And they took me to go climb Mount Rainier a couple of weekends ago. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4071.14s)]
*  So that was exciting. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4073.78s)]
*  So it's a challenging lifestyle because every variable in your life is changing except for you. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4074.58s)]
*  So it forces you to get really deep into certain routines that you can take with you everywhere. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4081.78s)]
*  For me, those are yoga and meditation and reading the classics, reading books by dead people. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4087.0600000000004s)]
*  And I can do that anywhere, even in an airport. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4093.6200000000003s)]
*  And then in terms of bringing in Ben as CEO and then Ben as CEO of Invisible, and he's doing a [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4097.46s)]
*  great job, I'm so delighted. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4103.06s)]
*  And he's doing a better job than I would. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4105.06s)]
*  And that's why I hired him. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4106.5s)]
*  And I think that these four roles get confused. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4108.58s)]
*  Founder, CEO, President, and Chairman. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4113.54s)]
*  These are very different roles. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4117.94s)]
*  The founder is often the soul of the business, the cultural and creative strategic force. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4120.82s)]
*  And founders are usually kind of wild. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4129.62s)]
*  And I'm certainly wild. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4132.5s)]
*  And it's actually tough for a founder to be both a revolutionary and a fiduciary. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4134.5s)]
*  It's a very different yin-yang parts. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4139.54s)]
*  And sometimes you mature into it. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4142.42s)]
*  But usually you start as a revolutionary, you become a fiduciary over time. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4145.06s)]
*  The CEO is a person running the business. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4149.06s)]
*  And so for years, I was basically stuck in my apartment in New York, grinding away endless [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4151.3s)]
*  amounts of calls and emails and Zoom calls and meetings. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4157.62s)]
*  And you're like a doctor that's on call 24-7-365. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4162.5s)]
*  Because you're building the business brick by brick. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4167.219999999999s)]
*  And so your Monday meetings are like, show me your OKR, show me your Gantt charts, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4170.0199999999995s)]
*  show me your budgets, where are we out on this, where are we out on that? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4174.5s)]
*  And it's the E in CEO that's the hard part. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4177.7s)]
*  It's execution. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4181.62s)]
*  It's always executing. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4183.299999999999s)]
*  Then there's the president. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4184.74s)]
*  The president is on planes kissing babies and building political alliances all around [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4185.7s)]
*  the world. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4191.86s)]
*  And those relationships can turn, they start as friendships and they can turn into all [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4192.66s)]
*  kinds of things. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4197.219999999999s)]
*  They could become an advisor or a board member. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4197.7s)]
*  They could become a client. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4199.7s)]
*  They could become, you could do a joint venture with them. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4201.46s)]
*  You start a company with them. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4203.46s)]
*  They could become co-founders. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4204.42s)]
*  You could hire them. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4205.78s)]
*  They could, you know, you can invest in them. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4207.0599999999995s)]
*  There's so many things you can do with these relationships. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4209.219999999999s)]
*  But that's what the president is doing, is holding the social capital of the organization [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4211.7s)]
*  and the loyalty and continuing to orient people towards the long-term vision. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4216.74s)]
*  The chairman is sort of on the mountaintop, so to speak. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4222.42s)]
*  And the chairman is focused on capital allocation, big decisions, like should we buy a company [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4225.62s)]
*  or should we raise money or what have you, governance, running boards and making sure [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4232.259999999999s)]
*  there's accountability. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4238.179999999999s)]
*  It's a very adult role being a chairman, you know, holding people accountable to results. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4239.46s)]
*  You're responsible for hiring and firing all the way up to the CEO level. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4243.7s)]
*  And you're responsible for incentives and pricing and compensation and for the sequencing [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4248.1s)]
*  of the roadmap of the business. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4254.74s)]
*  And so, you know, in the beginning, when you start a company and there's only one person [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4256.58s)]
*  and you and your dog, right, you're all four of those roles and you're the janitor, right? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4261.62s)]
*  Like you're all those. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4265.7s)]
*  And then over time, you sort of slowly unbundle. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4266.82s)]
*  And so, you know, maybe now we're unbundling the CEO role. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4270.58s)]
*  We have Shar Brumond is CEO of Infinity. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4274.66s)]
*  He's doing a great job. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4278.0199999999995s)]
*  Almost three decades of tech enabled services, executive and entrepreneurial experience at [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4279.7s)]
*  ABB and Ariba and other companies. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4284.42s)]
*  And then under him, we have seven or eight CEOs that are all amazing. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4286.66s)]
*  And a lot of these are early invisible people who've been with the company for, you know, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4290.74s)]
*  in one case has been with me from the beginning, but others, you know, six years or something. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4295.38s)]
*  And they've already earned their stock in Invisible and now they want to do the zero [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4299.62s)]
*  to one journey again. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4302.98s)]
*  And so they're there. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4304.26s)]
*  And then over time, I'm probably going to hire more presidents because I don't know [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4306.900000000001s)]
*  if this lifestyle is sustainable forever. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4310.26s)]
*  I'm young. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4313.14s)]
*  I'm turning 35 in two weeks. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4313.7s)]
*  So I will, you know, I can do this for probably until I'm 40. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4316.5s)]
*  But then at some point, we'll probably need to hire probably not just one president, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4320.02s)]
*  but there might be 12 presidents that are super high trust, high loyalty people that [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4323.7s)]
*  are doing this lifestyle. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4328.66s)]
*  And then I'll be chairman and then I'll have to figure out how to [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4330.820000000001s)]
*  escape out of that job. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4333.38s)]
*  And it kind of is it is the art of abstraction. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4335.46s)]
*  We talk about this. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4341.06s)]
*  Most people, if you're in an employee mindset, you don't want someone else to take your job. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4342.42s)]
*  But if you're in an entrepreneurial mindset, you're actually trying to work yourself out [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4347.14s)]
*  of a job. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4350.58s)]
*  You do it once, you do it 10 times, you do it 100 times, you master it, or you get as [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4351.22s)]
*  good as you can be at it, even if you're working on your weakness. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4355.38s)]
*  And then you hire someone who's going to do it better than you. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4358.58s)]
*  You train them, you manage them, and then you're abstracted. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4360.98s)]
*  And then you do another job. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4364.58s)]
*  But when you're in that abstracted place, for a short period of time, you're sitting [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4366.179999999999s)]
*  in the void. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4370.74s)]
*  You don't know what your job is anymore. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4371.78s)]
*  You're staring at the ceiling. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4373.379999999999s)]
*  That void place is actually where all the ideas come from and all the values created. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4375.94s)]
*  You're then doing the zero to one thing of doing, you know, you created a new job for [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4381.7s)]
*  yourself and you're doing it again. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4385.299999999999s)]
*  And then you hire someone to do it. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4386.98s)]
*  Then you manage them and abstract up. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4388.74s)]
*  And then you're managing a whole bunch of people and you hire someone to manage them. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4390.900000000001s)]
*  And then you're managing managers and then you're managing executives. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4395.3s)]
*  And then you're trying to hire a chairman. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4399.22s)]
*  And there was a political theorist in the last century who said, the sovereign governs [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4402.02s)]
*  in the state of exception. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4409.06s)]
*  So as long as you're in a position to fire, which is something we don't like talking about, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4411.46s)]
*  it's the brutal reality, though, of a hierarchy in business, then you are in control of the [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4418.74s)]
*  structure. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4424.18s)]
*  And so I've been paying special attention to board governance. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4425.06s)]
*  And so we have four directors. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4428.9800000000005s)]
*  In theory, you know, a majority of them could fire me. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4431.7s)]
*  But these are people that are incredible people and they're so accomplished. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4434.34s)]
*  One of them was the head of corporate development for under Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer for [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4439.22s)]
*  decades at Microsoft, Charlie Songhurst. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4443.780000000001s)]
*  He's my vice chairman. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4445.780000000001s)]
*  And I've been on a call with him like every week for seven years and I trust him. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4447.38s)]
*  And he, you know, and so you surround yourself with people that correct your blind spots. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4451.86s)]
*  And those are the people that you ultimately trust to put a sword to your neck if you've [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4456.66s)]
*  lost your mind and you're doing the wrong thing. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4461.06s)]
*  But that same accountability works downwards as well. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4464.5s)]
*  So if I ever got to the point where we were hiring presidents and hiring chairman, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4467.3s)]
*  there would have to be the similar accountability. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4471.78s)]
*  And that's sort of your way out. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4474.1s)]
*  And eventually, hopefully you just have the title of human, you know, you're just Peter [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4475.62s)]
*  or you're just Francis and you dropped all the titles. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4481.94s)]
*  And you're judged for the value you brought to the world, your life, the life of those [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4486.26s)]
*  that you touched and the dreams that you have going forward. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmGsjDTL2UI&t=4492.66s)]
