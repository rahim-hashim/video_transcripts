# Achieve Peak Creativity: Merging Flow States with AI Technology w/ Steven Kotler | EP #151
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0)
*  You're telling me your thinking is not better now in conjunction with the chat [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=0.0s)]
*  QBT that it was three years ago just working with Google? It's just faster. I [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4.88s)]
*  mean I don't know is it better? That's not the question. The question is [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=9.0s)]
*  Steven Kotler. Steven Kotler. Best-selling author and peak performance expert. What [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  does it take for you to be your best when it matters most? He is redefining [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=19.44s)]
*  human potential. Pattern recognition matching like with like lateral thinking. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  This is our ability to link unlike with unlike. We humans are far superior at [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=28.72s)]
*  lateral thinking. You're telling me that an AI system can't be as creative as a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=35.0s)]
*  human being. There's a revolution going on in our ability to take advantage of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=40.68s)]
*  our consciousness. This is before then there's a the next wave of neurotech as [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=45.2s)]
*  we know that's BCI that's brain computer interface. It's a thing now. It's real. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=50.2s)]
*  Please keep armaments and legs inside the ride at all times. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=54.0s)]
*  We're here today with my dear friend, my co-author of Abundance, Bold and the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=64.6s)]
*  Future is Faster Than You Think and very soon our fourth work together which [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=71.6s)]
*  we'll talk about. Very exciting. Very exciting. Steven Kotler is in York Times [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=75.4s)]
*  best-selling author, award-winning journalist, the executive director of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=79.12s)]
*  workflow research collective. One of the world's leading experts on human [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=83.0s)]
*  performance. He's written a number of incredible books. The Art of the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=87.44s)]
*  Impossible. I love that. It's a great name and as well as Stealing Fire. You got the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=91.72s)]
*  best names for your books. Well Abundance, Bold, I had some help. Well hey and then [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=96.54s)]
*  The Rise of Superman. That's amazing. That was the title that like I had [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=101.6s)]
*  that 10 years before I had the book. Yeah. I just knew I had to write a book with [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=106.44s)]
*  that title because the title was so good. And it's done amazing. You've been [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=109.56s)]
*  nominated for three Pulitzer Prizes, translated into over 50 languages. What's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=113.68s)]
*  wrong with the other 130 languages out there? I know, seriously. I mean they should really get a clue. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=117.52s)]
*  Soon. You know what the good news is? I've been translated into languages I [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  didn't even know still existed. I want to hear your audible book in the clicking language. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=125.28s)]
*  You're like, wow that's still a language. I thought that went away like 20 years ago. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=131.28s)]
*  Oh my god. You've appeared in over 110 publications including Academy, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=136.44s)]
*  academic journals like neuroscience, bio-behavioral reviews and psychophysiology. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=140.32s)]
*  That one just hasn't landed on my doorstep yet. And mainstream publications. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=146.2s)]
*  She would like that psychophys article though. It's interesting. It's a weird [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=152.04s)]
*  thing about mindset. We can talk about it. Okay, fantastic. And you just got [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=155.2s)]
*  published today and we'll talk about that one too. But you've been in you know [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=158.88s)]
*  sort of old-style media like the New York Times, Wired, Atlantic Monthly, Wall [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=164.48s)]
*  Street Journal, Time and Harvard Business Review. And along with your wife Joy, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=168.92s)]
*  you run a dog sanctuary. That's where I first met you. You know Rancho de Chihuahua. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=174.48s)]
*  How many Chihuahuas did you have? At our peak at one time I think it was 50 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=182.72s)]
*  something. Oh my god. I could deal with one. It's a hospice care facility. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  We've done this work for 18 years and we've helped basically 1200 dogs die along the way. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=194.16s)]
*  Wow. When they're yapping sometimes I really wish they would. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=201.68s)]
*  There is that. Yeah, I mean I will say that when you, I know things about grief [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=206.56s)]
*  that you shouldn't know because it's such and it's odd like when you actually have that many [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=213.04s)]
*  laps through the grieving process you start to realize like I think there's a three-day [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=218.08s)]
*  neurological grief cycle where grief was a mental illness until the 20th century and then [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=222.64s)]
*  they changed it to a psychological condition. But I think there's a three-day grief cycle where [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=228.55999999999997s)]
*  you're actually crazy. Like I think that was a legit diagnosis. I've wanted to do a lot of work [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=233.92s)]
*  on grief. I haven't done it yet but I will. But you will. Life is long. We're going to talk about [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=238.72s)]
*  AI. We'll talk about flow. We'll talk about mindsets. We'll talk about his research coming up. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=243.6s)]
*  You ready? Yeah, let's do this. Okay. All right. Fantastic. So first of all, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=249.92s)]
*  please keep arm and some legs inside the ride at all times. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=254.88s)]
*  First of all, it's amazing. Happy 28 year anniversary. Thank you. 28 years. Do you [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=259.52s)]
*  have a lot of people in your life that you've been friends with for 28 years? No. And I want to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=264.8s)]
*  go back to what we were talking about with this four days ago, which is we were talking about [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=270.4s)]
*  legacy, which is important to you and as part of your 360 community. And I think this is true. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=275.76s)]
*  When I think about what's impacted my legacy the most, if I have a legacy, whatever it is, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=285.2s)]
*  it's my long friendships with creative entrepreneurs without a doubt. Our friendship, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=290.88s)]
*  my 25 year relationship, my editor, things like that. That's actually the relationships [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=296.96s)]
*  of the biggest muscle, I think, in the end. I want to take us back. It was about, what did we [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=302.72s)]
*  publish the futures faster, you think? 2020? 2019. It was just before the pandemic, like a month. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  No, we were on Fox News. You don't remember this? We were on Fox News the day news leaked out of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=316.24s)]
*  China that there was a pandemic. And do you remember this? We're on Fox News and they found [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  out you were a doctor. And so they're asking you all these pandemic questions. We're trying to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=328.08s)]
*  talk about the futures faster than you think. But a lot has happened since we published that. And I [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=332.8s)]
*  have a list here. We had a pandemic. That was a thing. AI is now a very real thing. We're talking [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  about AI forever in bold and futures faster. But it's a thing now. It's real. It's real. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=344.0s)]
*  We'll talk about that. My full self-driving and my Tesla is no longer trying to kill me. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=351.12s)]
*  It works really well. Which is, by the way, knowing how you drive, probably. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=358.24s)]
*  I mean, listen, there are many times where it's like, I don't trust myself. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to put it on FSD because it's safer than I am as a driver. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  I've ridden with you. Truth. He speaks the truth. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=370.0s)]
*  Yeah. Starship is flying, which is amazing. Amazing. Amazing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=374.4s)]
*  Yeah. Let's see what else. Elon is in the White House, sort of. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. I don't even know what's in that one. There was no predictions on that one. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  Did Ray even foresee that one? Is that in one of his books somewhere? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=387.28s)]
*  No prediction sequence there. I heard yesterday this rumor that Jeff Bezos is going to run for [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=391.12s)]
*  president. But that's a rumor. We're just starting it right now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=398.24s)]
*  And then Bitcoin hits 100,000. Pretty amazing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=402.8s)]
*  And then no, that not real money. I'm a big Bitcoin believer. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=407.36s)]
*  Okay. Do you own any Bitcoin? Yes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=411.6s)]
*  You do. Okay. Do you own more? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=413.6s)]
*  No. Do you want to? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=416.08s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. And then quantum computing is sort of materialized. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=417.76s)]
*  That's the one. Because I remember reading, I don't know when David Deutsch's book on quantum [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=421.92s)]
*  computing, which is still to this day, one of the most confusing books I've ever read on quantum [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=427.6s)]
*  computing. But I want to say it was like the early 90s. And I remember, maybe I was in grad [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  school, just out of grad school. And I remember trying to read it and just being so dazzled by [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=436.64s)]
*  the audacity of the, like, there's no way. And here we are, quantum computing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=443.28s)]
*  Yeah. Hartmut Neven, who heads Google's quantum labs and their Willow chip, which has shown with [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=447.84s)]
*  increasing qubits, there is a reduction in error rate. And that's amazing. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=457.76s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. I mean, that's the realization. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=464.55999999999995s)]
*  And for the first time ever- Wow. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=469.44s)]
*  I don't know. But you and I will be with Hartmut in a week's time. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=470.64s)]
*  A week's time. Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=475.68s)]
*  Yeah. We should ask him. And really understand that. We're going to be having a conversation [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=476.32s)]
*  on the convergence of quantum and consciousness. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=481.2s)]
*  So this is a really weird-ass 10. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=485.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  Transition. But in neurodynamics, there's this idea known as the free energy principle. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=489.28s)]
*  It's essentially the diminishment of uncertainty, that the brain is always trying to diminish [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=494.0s)]
*  uncertainty in every situation. And one of the questions we've been asking a lot, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=497.76s)]
*  and it's a flow question. So the question people have been starting to ask, ourselves included, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=502.24s)]
*  is, is flow just a human property? Because it's a physical systems property too. And you see the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=506.96s)]
*  same dynamics when you're looking at water flowing through pipes and whatever. And the question has [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=512.96s)]
*  been, is this actually a foundational property of the universe? And you could look at, if the error [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=517.68s)]
*  rate goes down in quantum computing, as you add qubits, that's an example of the free energy [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=523.84s)]
*  principle. It's uncertainty being diminished over time. And I wonder, because the uncertainty [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=528.72s)]
*  principle, the free energy principle is a mathematical principle. It doesn't have a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  physical reality, but it predicts almost every system in the body. And we've just extended it [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=538.08s)]
*  today, the paper that came out, into intuition and flow. So it's really now every system in the body, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=542.88s)]
*  and we're starting to look at non-physical systems. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  Everybody, Peter here. If you're enjoying this episode, please help me get the message of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=550.08s)]
*  abundance out to the world. We're truly living during the most extraordinary time ever in human [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=554.88s)]
*  history, and I want to get this mindset out to everyone. Please subscribe and follow wherever [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=559.76s)]
*  you get your podcasts, and turn on notifications so we can let you know when the next episode is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=565.9200000000001s)]
*  being dropped. All right, back to our episode. You know, it's interesting, the idea that [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=571.12s)]
*  consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, and that we create reality by collapsing the way form. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=577.04s)]
*  And until we do that, things are in superposition. So this is just funny. I'd asked Tony Robbins if [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=586.4s)]
*  he would do a particular project with me, and I left him a voice note last night. And this morning, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  when I woke up, because he does his, you know, he's typically up till three or four a.m., and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=597.04s)]
*  I get my voice notes from him at like three a.m. in the morning. And so this morning, when I woke [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  up, I was like, what's wrong with the Tony Robbins conference? You can't stay up all night, don't go. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=606.32s)]
*  And then I got up at five a.m. this morning, and I see his voice note there, and I'm like, okay, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  the answer to my question is in superposition right now. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=616.6400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=621.5200000000001s)]
*  Right? And it's like, okay, can I collapse the way form in the affirmative? Because it's there, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=622.24s)]
*  there's a yes or no in that voice note. And it was just a fascinating thought. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=629.44s)]
*  Just because you put physics science names on these things doesn't mean I don't think you've [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=634.0s)]
*  gone completely round the bend. Well, okay. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=638.8s)]
*  You know, what else is new? Yeah, craziness is a good, good feature. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=642.64s)]
*  You're the guy who, but I've like, I've learned when crazy shit flies out of your mouth, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=647.68s)]
*  believe it. Because 30 years ago, you were like, no, no, no, we're gonna open the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=652.48s)]
*  private space frontier. Oh, I want to get into the AI of it all. Okay. And I want to get into it [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=656.8s)]
*  through creativity. So, you know, if I think about your fundamental abilities, what you teach, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=663.2s)]
*  because you teach amazing programs and write amazing books, it really is about tapping into [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=672.48s)]
*  creativity in flow. And the question is, is AI going to enhance or destroy that? And, you know, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=678.24s)]
*  I kind of think there's nothing that AI can't do in the creative field. So, I want to have that, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  I want to have a conversation with you. I've always wanted to. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  First of all, it's a hard question. My answer, my instinctive answer, just, and I'll back it up [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=701.7600000000001s)]
*  with why I think this might be true. My experience with AI has been, one, I think [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=708.08s)]
*  most people, especially creatives, right? You see this a lot with whether we're talking about [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=717.2s)]
*  creative entrepreneurs or creative artists. They were told things about AI. It's going to make you [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  more productive. It's going to save you time. It's going to do a bunch of these things. And then they [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=726.0s)]
*  start playing with AI, even like a large language model. And it doesn't do those things. They get [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  disappointed. They walk away. Yet. But my point is what it does do is it doesn't help you [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=735.04s)]
*  do the task more quickly. It levels you up too. So you can do the task at a level you can't [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=744.16s)]
*  normally do. So what I see happening is AI seems to be additive on top of creativity. And what [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=750.64s)]
*  has always been the case, and this is definitely true with large language models. So let's talk [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  about what large language models and writing for a second. One of the things that's very difficult [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=761.84s)]
*  with large language models, because they're probabilistic. So they're going to the most [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  common, the most average. The standard is great writing is like 90% of the sentence is exactly [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=771.2s)]
*  what you'd expect. And it's sort of what chat GBT would come up with. But the last word in the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=778.0s)]
*  sentence is going to be something totally unusual, really outside of the property field. And that's [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  the one that's going to land the meaning and the content and elevate it. You mean in a when a human [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=788.08s)]
*  writes it. When a human writes it. That's usually how great writing is, is like most everything [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=792.1600000000001s)]
*  fits your expected pattern. And then something breaks the pattern. And that's where when you, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=796.88s)]
*  first of all, when you break that pattern, the brain notices, right? So it catches your attention. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  And that's where meaning comes from. Large language models are not designed to do that. You can loosen [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=805.36s)]
*  the parameters. People don't do this, but it's really fun. You can go inside like chat GBT or [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=809.76s)]
*  any of the large language models and tune their accuracy of their predictions. So you can get them [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=814.24s)]
*  to be more fanciful or more creative if you want. But what it doesn't tend to do is give you the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=819.28s)]
*  target accuracy of a human with that kind of stuff. I love your writing style. And I think folks [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=824.72s)]
*  should know when we met 28 years ago, you were doing a couple of articles on me, one for GQ, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=830.88s)]
*  one for Wired. And I'll never forget. I'm reading this article that you wrote that just got published [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=836.96s)]
*  was the GQ article. And I'm reading and I'm like, I literally stopped dead in my tracks as I'm [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=844.64s)]
*  reading and had an experience I've never had, which is I stopped and noticed the writing. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=850.7199999999999s)]
*  Usually when I read something, you just read and you take it. But I was like, wow, that was beautiful. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  And then I read on as like, that was beautiful. And I was like, this guy [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=864.48s)]
*  writes in a way I really love. And I remember calling you, I assume you remember this. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=868.48s)]
*  Totally. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=874.4000000000001s)]
*  And I said, Steven, I want to take writing lessons from you. And that was one of them. It's still [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=875.12s)]
*  nowhere near- [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=882.32s)]
*  Yeah, but I want to tell every something because this is to me the most impressive thing, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=883.12s)]
*  one of the more impressive things about you. So I don't know, let's say I've taught 20 friends, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=887.6s)]
*  not many, but like 20 friends over the years how to actually really write and really work with them [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=891.9200000000001s)]
*  on it. Nobody practiced except you. Like I remember there was a gap between like bold and faster [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=896.48s)]
*  where we lost touch for about a year or two. But I remember when you like came back and we were [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=904.88s)]
*  talking about Pitching Festival, you sent me something. And I remember reading it and I was [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=910.72s)]
*  like, holy shit, he's been practicing. Like I was so blown away. Your sentences had gotten [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  so much better. And this is the, I think the why we're, I think we're having so much fun [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=920.16s)]
*  writing the new book. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=924.08s)]
*  Yeah. By the way, our new book is amazing. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=924.88s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=929.6s)]
*  It's the, we'll talk about it later, but it's the follow on some 14 years later to [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=930.24s)]
*  Abundance the Future is Better than You Think. My working name is Age of Abundance. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=937.2s)]
*  My working name is We Are as Gods. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=942.24s)]
*  Yeah. So we're going to figure out which, and by the way, if you have comments about [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=944.1600000000001s)]
*  which subtitle, which title you like, put them in the- [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=948.24s)]
*  Age of Abundance or We Are as Gods. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=951.76s)]
*  Yes. Okay. Anyway. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=954.4799999999999s)]
*  Or we could arm wrestle for it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=957.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that will take a little longer. At the end of the day though, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=958.7199999999999s)]
*  it's been a blast writing this book with you and it's moving so much faster. I mean, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  your writing has gotten extraordinarily better. I personally, I think- [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=970.8s)]
*  So much better. So much better. There's, it was the novel that I just finished right before [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=974.56s)]
*  we started working on our book. It was the first time it was like, because each of my books is a [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=980.48s)]
*  little bit different, written differently, mostly because I want the challenge. Like I'll write in [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=984.8000000000001s)]
*  a particular style and be like, okay, this is great, but if I could get, increase the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=989.2s)]
*  fact density per sentence or whatever it is. So everything's a stretch and sometimes in very [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=992.08s)]
*  radically different directions. And then in this last book, the novel, it all like finally came [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=998.96s)]
*  together. I'm 57 years old and finally like all the threads click. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  The waveform collapsed. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  The waveform collapsed. And what we're seeing in the new book is that it's all, it's like 40 years [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1008.72s)]
*  of practice kind of combining and coming together. It's going to be awesome. It's also, by the way, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
*  couple things that are worth pointing out here, because we're talking about creativity and we're [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  both really passionate about peak performance aging. In your fifties, a bunch of cognitive skills turn [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1024.4s)]
*  on for the very first time. So it's because the two halves of your brain start talking to each [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1033.92s)]
*  other. Like never before. Normally they work in opposition. Sounds like a marriage too. Normally, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1038.64s)]
*  and as you around 50, they start talking to each other provided you creativity is what sort of [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1045.1200000000001s)]
*  unlocks it, but it increases intelligence, creativity, perspective, empathy, wisdom, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1050.64s)]
*  which is a measurable psychological trait. So I think part of what I'm, part of what we're seeing [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1056.48s)]
*  is actually the fact that your brain gets better with age. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1063.28s)]
*  Might be self delusional, but I feel like I'm smarter and more capable than I've ever been. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1067.44s)]
*  I do too. You feel about me? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1072.32s)]
*  I do actually feel that about you. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1076.16s)]
*  Oh my God. So here's my question. If I were to take your writing, your books and I feed that into, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1078.08s)]
*  I've tried it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  Feed it into the best language. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1089.52s)]
*  Well, but the language models have gotten better, right? Gemini 2.0 and what we'll be seeing next [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1092.16s)]
*  set of open AI and out of the next generation of Claude and say, okay, I want you to notice [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1099.6000000000001s)]
*  this incredible writing style, analyze it, why it's different, how it's different. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1108.24s)]
*  There will be a point. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1114.24s)]
*  Which it can. And then I'll say, write like that. I do believe that AI is going to be [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1116.48s)]
*  able to mimic Steven Kotler's extraordinary writing style. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1121.92s)]
*  And so I'm just curious, how do you feel about that? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1130.8000000000002s)]
*  So I think there's three points. One, okay, so let's talk about why I believe, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1133.68s)]
*  and I've said this a lot and we'll talk a lot about the Alliance later on, but you know, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1140.8000000000002s)]
*  my new project, which is working with creatives, one of the things I want to do is train them [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1146.88s)]
*  in AI. So they don't feel threatened? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1151.12s)]
*  So they don't feel threatened. So they don't lose their jobs. So they can continue to build. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1153.6799999999998s)]
*  What I think with AI is it raises the bottom to the middle very easily. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1157.6s)]
*  That's really like- [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1163.12s)]
*  The data is clearly there. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1164.56s)]
*  Clearly there, right. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1166.0s)]
*  It definitely is leveling the playing field and taking your lowest quarter percentage, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1167.04s)]
*  operating employees or whatever, and bringing them up to your standard. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1173.1999999999998s)]
*  So what I think is also happening, but it's a lot harder to measure, or I haven't seen anybody try [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1177.2s)]
*  to measure it, is in the same way the bottom is being lifted to the middle, the top is being [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1182.0s)]
*  lifted far higher and not like far, far higher. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1187.52s)]
*  I haven't seen that data. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1190.96s)]
*  Oh, no, I haven't seen that data either. I don't think anybody's looking at it, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1191.92s)]
*  but I guarantee you that's what's happening because I'll just give you, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1195.2s)]
*  you're telling me your thinking is not better now in conjunction with ChatGBT than it was [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1199.04s)]
*  three years ago, just working with Google. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1204.48s)]
*  It's just faster. Yes, it's faster. I mean, I don't know, is it better? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1206.4s)]
*  I would have to do a lot of Googling to be able to get sort of the corpus of knowledge I can get [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1212.8s)]
*  out of Gemini or ChatGBT when I ask it a question like help me think about the different dimensions [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1219.68s)]
*  of this or help me understand how I might structure this. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1226.96s)]
*  So let me answer your question from just a psychological nor biological perspective. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  ChatGBT, all the AIs is general, they're pattern recognition systems. That's what they are. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1238.4s)]
*  And pattern recognition is like with like, it's matching like with like, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1243.6000000000001s)]
*  and it's finding closer flung connections. AI is going to be better at this than humans, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1247.76s)]
*  already is probably. Lateral thinking is outside the box thinking. It's the thing that mainly gets [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1252.32s)]
*  amplified in flow. This is our ability to link unlike with unlike. It's really far flung [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1258.48s)]
*  connections between very, very different things. Which is where innovation comes from. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1265.28s)]
*  Which is where innovation comes from. Humans are far superior at lateral thinking. In fact, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1270.0s)]
*  most AIs are literally designed not to do that. They're designed, they're convergent thinkers, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1276.16s)]
*  they're not divergent thinkers. You can play with it and you can, as I said, you can get inside [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1280.4s)]
*  ChatGBT and muck around and try to get it to think more laterally. And it's like, you have to [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1285.04s)]
*  experiment with it to do it. But let me take you forward. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1292.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. You think that ability is going to come on. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1295.2s)]
*  I think, listen, at the end of the day, if Elon is correct in his extrapolation. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1297.44s)]
*  You know I disagree with Elon on many things. I understand, but you know, this doesn't come [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  from just him. It comes from a multitude of people. And one of the conversations here in 2025 is, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1308.8799999999999s)]
*  have we achieved AGI? What the hell is AGI in the first place? It's a blurry line, but [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1314.32s)]
*  artificial general intelligence. And then how many generations are we away from an iterative [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1320.56s)]
*  improvement that gets us to digital super intelligence? So are you telling me that, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1326.6399999999999s)]
*  okay, maybe let's say it's not a billion fold better or even a million fold, but a thousand [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1331.04s)]
*  times better, right? You tell me that an AI system that is a thousand times better [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1338.72s)]
*  can't be as creative in every discipline as a human being. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1346.24s)]
*  That's not the question. The answer to that is yes, probably. The question is, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1351.68s)]
*  is that AI going to be more creative without a human in the chain or with the human in the chain? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1358.88s)]
*  If you put up the AI that's a thousand times smarter than me versus me working with an AI. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1363.76s)]
*  Let me tell you the data just came out. So this is a few months old now. I've talked about this [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1369.12s)]
*  along with Salim Ismail on my episode WTF Just Happened in Tech. There was a study done in which [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1376.64s)]
*  an AI chatbot, a physician on their own was given data to analyze a medical condition or number [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1384.8s)]
*  medical conditions and they hit something like 75% correct. When they partnered with an AI chatbot, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1392.96s)]
*  they got like 80% correct, but the AI chatbot on its own without the human in the loop was at like [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1399.92s)]
*  95% correct. But that's again, conversion thinking diagnosis. It's not divergent thinking. So yes, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1406.56s)]
*  for sure. One, I think that humans in the chain are going to be smarter than just the AI alone. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1415.36s)]
*  Two, it doesn't even, to me it's a nonsensical question because creativity is so fundamental [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  to human health and wellbeing. I don't think we're going to abandon it. Everybody is under this idea [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1431.1999999999998s)]
*  that like, suddenly the technology is going to show up. So we're going to totally change [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1437.52s)]
*  how we're wired on the end. It doesn't work that way. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1442.64s)]
*  No, no, we're not. Exactly. Our neurobiology in particular, our hormones, our neurotransmitters, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1444.8000000000002s)]
*  which is an area that you have mastered an understanding of. So I have so many ways to go [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1450.88s)]
*  here. One of my biggest concerns, I was up at Stanford giving a talk on this, is that if AI [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1457.68s)]
*  and humanoid robotics make our living so automatical, so easy, so automatic, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1465.44s)]
*  and we no longer are challenged, or we no longer have difficulties to overcome, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1472.56s)]
*  are we able to survive as humans? Certainly with flow, with, you know, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1481.52s)]
*  flow states have triggers and the most important one is the challenge skills balance, right? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1486.0800000000002s)]
*  We drop into flow when the challenge of whatever task we're doing is like four or five percent [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1490.24s)]
*  greater than our skill set. We stretch and that focuses our attention and drives us into the [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1495.2s)]
*  system and blah, blah, blah, drives us into flow. That's fundamental, and we can't like, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1500.56s)]
*  the data on flow at this point, happiness, well-being, meaning, overall life satisfaction, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1506.24s)]
*  all those things that we're going to need no matter what. Like really, one of the things [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1511.68s)]
*  that we're looking at in the new book, right, is how do you sustain those things in an auto-magical [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1515.44s)]
*  world? I, like to me, first of all, I'm already seeing it like made by humans is like a tag, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1520.72s)]
*  you know what I mean? Like in fact, the new novel I thought for a while that I was going to publish [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1528.48s)]
*  it as Steven Kotler and Friends and with parentheses under it made by humans. Just, how about- [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1537.04s)]
*  Just Kotler and human friends. And human friends would do that. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1542.56s)]
*  So, have we discussed the universe 25 experiment? No. So, this was in the 60s in New York, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1546.16s)]
*  a well-known psychologist basically builds a luxurious habitat for rats, okay? You know, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1554.0s)]
*  something that was massive and you can see the images if you Google universe 25. And there was [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1564.0800000000002s)]
*  going to be as much food as they wanted, as much nesting space as they wanted, as much area to go. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1569.6s)]
*  And they put it, they start with four breeding pairs and they put them in universe 25 and they [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1577.52s)]
*  started breeding and living, loving life. And you watch as at the end of this process, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  they die out. The entire population of rats die out. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1590.72s)]
*  Because there's no challenge? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1599.2s)]
*  Because there's no challenge. There is, and we can go into it in more detail, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1600.0800000000002s)]
*  we probably will in Age of Abundance. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1604.16s)]
*  We are as- [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1608.64s)]
*  We are as gods, yes. Anyway, and it's fascinating. And I think about that. If all of a sudden, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1609.92s)]
*  as a creative, everything you wanted to do was doable by the snap of a finger. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1617.28s)]
*  The joy of writing, the joy of art, the joy of building a company, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1625.6s)]
*  the joy of whatever becomes far less. And I'm trying to understand how we deal with that, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1633.12s)]
*  because we all know if you enter a video game and the video game is too hard, you give up. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1641.44s)]
*  If the video game is too easy, you give up. It's got to be just- [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1648.3200000000002s)]
*  You're on the sweet spot. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1652.16s)]
*  Just in that sweet spot. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1653.1200000000001s)]
*  That's four or five percent. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1654.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm wondering if at the end of the day, when there is this incredible [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1655.04s)]
*  digital super intelligence and humanoid robotics and automation, and we live in [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1660.48s)]
*  what we talked about as a technological socialism where technology is taking care of you, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1665.2s)]
*  not the state, whether we revert to virtual worlds where always that level of challenge is [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1669.92s)]
*  just the right level. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1678.8000000000002s)]
*  So one, like I've said for a while, that the singularity I'm paying the most attention to [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1680.0s)]
*  is when VR gets to the point that it can produce the full suite of- When we can have more [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1686.3200000000002s)]
*  pleasurable, more exciting, more interesting experiences inside the simulation than in reality, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1693.76s)]
*  do we migrate into virtual worlds? That's the question I've been asking for a while. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1699.52s)]
*  And VR, of all the techs we've been looking at, it's the one that seems to be lagging the most, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1703.2s)]
*  at least. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1708.1599999999999s)]
*  But AI will enable it massively. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1709.6s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1712.0s)]
*  Is this the answer to Fermi's paradox? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1713.44s)]
*  That's an interesting question. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1716.1599999999999s)]
*  Which is Fermi's paradox, for those who know, is the notion of where is all the alien life? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1717.12s)]
*  Even in a slow replication and travel rate, they should be here by now. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1724.32s)]
*  Somebody should contact us. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1728.72s)]
*  And the question of, there's a whole bunch of media right now that, in fact, they have contacted us [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1730.8799999999999s)]
*  since the last 50 years, since World War I. I love a recent conversation I had with somebody where [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1737.12s)]
*  we saw a flurry of UFO sightings when the nuclear bomb was being created. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1743.4399999999998s)]
*  And now we're seeing a flurry of UFO sightings when AI is on the exponential rise. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1751.4399999999998s)]
*  So are the aliens here to make sure we don't destroy ourselves in these inflection points [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1758.08s)]
*  in human society? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1764.8s)]
*  Maybe they're helping us along. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1765.6s)]
*  Here, have nuclear power. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1766.8799999999999s)]
*  Here, have AI. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1768.96s)]
*  We're coming for your planet in a second, but we don't have to do the hard work of killing. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1770.6399999999999s)]
*  You guys are going to do it for us. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1773.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1777.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1778.96s)]
*  I'm going to avoid that rabbit hole. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1779.6s)]
*  So there's a handful of questions here. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1784.32s)]
*  One is, we seem to think, and technology is some kind of incredibly unstable force, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1786.96s)]
*  where we don't make decisions afterwards. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1796.88s)]
*  Once it's out of the box. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1798.96s)]
*  And that's what I've said before, and we're doing it right now, as a society. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1800.48s)]
*  Social media broke the world. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1806.08s)]
*  And it broke the world because it's a massively addictive technology [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1809.1200000000001s)]
*  that was sprung on the world without... [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1813.3600000000001s)]
*  We didn't know it had all the negative effects and blah, blah, blah. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1816.4s)]
*  Now it's 20 years later, and we're saying, oh no, wait a minute. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1820.24s)]
*  Maybe it's not a good idea for our kids to be on social media all the time. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1823.76s)]
*  Maybe we need to rethink how we interact with this particular tool. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1827.3600000000001s)]
*  I think that's going to happen with AI. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1832.0s)]
*  I think that's what happens when our technology starts to exceed our best capacities in that way. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1834.3200000000002s)]
*  I think we've come to a point where we're like, we're humans. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1840.96s)]
*  We can make a decision here to not engage. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1843.52s)]
*  I think you're going to start seeing AI-free countries. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1846.8s)]
*  I think you're going to start seeing technology countries where they're like, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1849.52s)]
*  no, no, we're good with the technology here. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1852.56s)]
*  We're going to stop. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1854.32s)]
*  We're going to draw the line there. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1855.52s)]
*  I think these kinds of changes are going to start coming. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1856.8799999999999s)]
*  So you gave me some numbers last night when we were hanging out having dinner [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1859.36s)]
*  about the size of the creative economy. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  And as we're talking about AI and creativity, could you recount this? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1868.0s)]
*  Yeah. So here's this. It's interesting. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1871.04s)]
*  If you're looking like if you're interested in sort of impacting your bottom line, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1874.8799999999999s)]
*  where should you skill up? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1879.92s)]
*  And I would create a flow would be my answer. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1881.2s)]
*  And so the creative economy has tripled in size in the past 15 years. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1884.32s)]
*  Are you defining creative economies now? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1893.6s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. So let's back this up. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1894.8799999999999s)]
*  So usually when you think about this, you think about urban planner and economist, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1896.88s)]
*  Richard Florida, who wrote the rise of the creative classes. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1901.3600000000001s)]
*  And he had two categories of creatives and that there were professional creatives [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1904.88s)]
*  and the super creative core. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1910.0s)]
*  Super creative core are folks like us. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1911.6000000000001s)]
*  They're creative entrepreneurs, creative artists, creative writers, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1914.0800000000002s)]
*  to these people who are inventing culture, inventing the future. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1916.88s)]
*  And creative professionals are things like you're a doctor, you're an accountant, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1920.16s)]
*  and you're trying to bring in novelty and new techniques and be creative inside the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1925.6s)]
*  discipline. And those are the two classes. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1931.04s)]
*  When you look at both of them, they both exploded. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1933.6799999999998s)]
*  The super creative core went from like a hundred million people to 300 million people. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1936.8799999999999s)]
*  The numbers in America are to trillion dollar economy. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1942.7199999999998s)]
*  And it's interesting because Adobe State of Creates study, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1946.1599999999999s)]
*  Adobe's done a bunch of really great studies. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1949.04s)]
*  Like once every five years, they do a global study on creativity. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1950.8799999999999s)]
*  They're phenomenal studies and they've started them back in the 2000s. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1954.48s)]
*  In their 2016 study, they found that creatives and people who use creativity in their work [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1957.92s)]
*  out earn non-creatives by 13%. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1964.16s)]
*  In America, it's a trillion dollar economy. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1968.32s)]
*  Globally, it's like a three trillion dollar economy or a 3.2 trillion dollar economy. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1970.08s)]
*  So it's a big chunk in America. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1974.16s)]
*  It's like 4.5% of the GDP comes out of creativity. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1975.6s)]
*  So and it's the fastest growing sector. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1979.76s)]
*  And for good reason, back in 2010, IBM did a very famous study of CEOs. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1983.2s)]
*  And they wanted to know what's the quality in the 21st century that will most help a CEO thrive. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1989.44s)]
*  Creativity topped the list. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1995.1200000000001s)]
*  There was a more recent study a couple years ago that looked at the same question. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=1996.64s)]
*  They came back with analytical thinking, problem solving and creativity. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2001.76s)]
*  And I will tell you that like that's redundant because really good analytical thinking is [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2005.92s)]
*  creative, really good problem solving is creative. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2011.28s)]
*  So the whole thing is essentially creativity and creative problem solving. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2014.72s)]
*  So the question, bringing it back to AI then, if AI is a creativity enhancing tool, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2018.48s)]
*  which can take people who are not part of the creative community into the creative ecosystem, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2028.8s)]
*  the question is, is the value in terms of earning power, in terms of being in business, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2036.72s)]
*  going to demonetize as the number of creatives? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2043.0400000000002s)]
*  That's an interesting question. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2046.64s)]
*  Here, let me go back to your AI creativity. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2047.76s)]
*  First of all, let me give you creativity is technically defined as the creation of novel [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2050.88s)]
*  and useful ideas. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2056.4s)]
*  And the useful is important because it's not just enough to have something cool idea in [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2057.92s)]
*  their head. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2061.6800000000003s)]
*  You actually have to put it in the world. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2062.2400000000002s)]
*  You have to show it to other people. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2063.92s)]
*  So there's risk taking involved in the creative process also at the end of it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2065.1200000000003s)]
*  When we look at creativity, one of the things, because I know we're both interested in this. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2069.28s)]
*  When we look at the progress in AI, people are looking at it as if it was separate from [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2076.48s)]
*  progress in consciousness hacking technologies, also on the human side of the equation. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2082.48s)]
*  So it's not just that we're augmenting the machines, the humans are being augmented. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2087.52s)]
*  The humans are being augmented. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2092.24s)]
*  If you think about, so 20, let's just talk about flow and creativity. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2093.68s)]
*  So my old organization, the Flow Genome Project, did a big study with CEO leaders. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2097.68s)]
*  We want to know how much more productive they were, creative they were in flow. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2104.64s)]
*  McKinsey had did this really famous study of CEO leaders and found they were 500% more [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2108.24s)]
*  productive in flow. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2114.48s)]
*  It was like a 10 year study, went around the globe, talked to tons of people. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2115.28s)]
*  Self-reported, so you always got to bring this up. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2118.24s)]
*  What percentage of their working life are they in flow? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2121.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's a small fraction. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2124.88s)]
*  No, that's an open question that I'll hold on. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2126.2400000000002s)]
*  Let me just get there. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2130.0s)]
*  Creativity, we found people on average were 700% more creative. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2133.44s)]
*  That's what they reported. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2137.1200000000003s)]
*  And we were like, God, that number is crazy. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2138.0800000000004s)]
*  So creativity can be broken down. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2140.0800000000004s)]
*  This psychologist named Mumford did it into eight categories, problem identification all [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2142.1600000000003s)]
*  the way through solution implementation. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2146.48s)]
*  And we tried to measure those independently in flow. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2149.44s)]
*  We found that each of those eight categories increases by 40 to 60%. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2152.32s)]
*  So breaking it down, which starts to add towards those big numbers. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2156.56s)]
*  My point, when 30 years ago, when the AI conversation started, humans were trying to [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2160.88s)]
*  use psychology to train people into flow. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2166.32s)]
*  And the classic example I always give is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the godfather of [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2169.36s)]
*  flow psychology, wrote a book called Flow in Sports, where he worked with the top [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2173.12s)]
*  sports psychologist. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2177.2s)]
*  And they tried to use the psychology of flow to train up top athletes and they sucked [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2178.16s)]
*  at it. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2181.68s)]
*  They're bad. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2182.16s)]
*  Like it's in books and print. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2182.64s)]
*  You can see their hit rate is terrible with the Flow Research Collective, with our core [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2184.24s)]
*  flow training Zero to Dangerous. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2188.72s)]
*  By the way, another name I love is Zero to Dangerous. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2191.68s)]
*  15,000 people in 160 countries, 28 industries have taken that class. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2194.08s)]
*  On average, we see a 73.8% increase in flow. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2199.68s)]
*  By the way, you know that 62.4% of people make up stats on the spot. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not making this data up. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2208.7999999999997s)]
*  You can find it on our website and the data. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2210.24s)]
*  But my point is, if you're 700% more productive in flow or more creative in flow, and we've [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2213.2799999999997s)]
*  taken it from, we don't know how to train this at all, to, oh no, it's reliable, it's [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2221.12s)]
*  repeatable. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2226.48s)]
*  And that's a 73% increase in the amount of time spent in flow. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2227.3599999999997s)]
*  So usually when people come to us, they're like, no, I get into flow maybe once, twice [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2232.48s)]
*  a week. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2236.56s)]
*  And by the time they're done, it's twice a day. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2237.12s)]
*  And it's pretty steady and consistent. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2239.44s)]
*  This is like low tech. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2243.12s)]
*  We haven't even started adding in all the, there's a revolution in what you could call, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2244.48s)]
*  for lack of a better term, consciousness raising technology. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2249.36s)]
*  We saw the first wave were like meditation apps and things like that. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2252.8s)]
*  The second wave, so for example, I have a new partnership with Vital Neuro. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2257.2s)]
*  They make a phenomenal EEG headset and it's a neurofeedback EEG headset. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2261.12s)]
*  Is that why you shave your hair like that? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2265.68s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2267.44s)]
*  So you can get the electrodes back on? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2268.3199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2269.68s)]
*  It's exactly right. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2270.24s)]
*  But I've been watching, this is like portable EEG tech. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2272.4s)]
*  I've been playing with this stuff since the early 2000s and in the early 2000s, I've got [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2277.04s)]
*  every single portable EEG device that's ever made. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2281.7599999999998s)]
*  I've got a cool display of it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2284.64s)]
*  They were terrible. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2286.56s)]
*  Now they're portable, they work. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2288.08s)]
*  One of the reasons we partnered with them is we identified, I've identified like five or [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2290.2400000000002s)]
*  six neural markers for flow was we transitioned to a flow state that nobody had ever been able [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2296.0s)]
*  to find before. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2300.32s)]
*  This was three years ago. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2303.6000000000004s)]
*  Three years ago, we were like trying to figure out, can we measure this? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2305.1200000000003s)]
*  Can we, blah, blah, blah. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2307.84s)]
*  We needed fMRIs and it was half million dollars to do the experiment. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2309.04s)]
*  We couldn't even do it. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2312.88s)]
*  They can now measure it with this freaking portable, three years later. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2314.1600000000003s)]
*  The same signal that we couldn't get it with fMRI, we can now get it here. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2317.44s)]
*  And you know what, you just had Mary Lou Jepsen on, we just interviewed her, talked to her. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2321.04s)]
*  Her technology takes us farther. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2325.52s)]
*  My point is AI is evolving. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2327.28s)]
*  Humans and our ability, there's a revolution going on in our ability to take advantage [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2330.88s)]
*  of our consciousness. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2336.56s)]
*  This is before there's the next wave of neurotech as we know, that's BCI, that's brain computer [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2337.36s)]
*  interface. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2343.52s)]
*  That takes us to a whole other level. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2344.32s)]
*  So it's not, humans aren't static in this picture. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2345.76s)]
*  That's the thing that people forget when they have the AI conversation. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2348.7200000000003s)]
*  They're like, AI is exploding. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2351.92s)]
*  I'm like, all right, great, but you're 700% more creative in flow. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2353.36s)]
*  And that's gone from this rare state to something that's reliable. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2357.28s)]
*  I can imagine having my AI, let's call it Jarvis. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2360.88s)]
*  For lack of a better term. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2366.48s)]
*  Where did that word come from? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2368.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2369.1200000000003s)]
*  Stephen constantly makes fun of me because in every one of our books, Jarvis appears. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2370.0800000000004s)]
*  I love Jarvis. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2375.36s)]
*  I mean, I think we're going to find a way to get Jarvis into We Are As Gods. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2376.0s)]
*  Okay, that's great. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2380.0s)]
*  Right after we write the Age of Abundance. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2380.88s)]
*  So maybe let's just call it Jarvis 2.0. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2383.6s)]
*  So listen, I can imagine if I have Jarvis on and I say maximize me in flow, that it [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2388.7200000000003s)]
*  will be able to do things as an AI to basically continuously tip me into flow. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2397.04s)]
*  So all the cool stuff, the most of the cool stuff that because we're doing a lot of work, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2402.96s)]
*  we have a humans. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2406.56s)]
*  My belief is that humans and flow collaborating with each other and AI are going to own the [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2409.36s)]
*  future. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2413.76s)]
*  And is this going to be true 50 years from now, 30 years from now? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2414.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2418.08s)]
*  But is it going to be true for the next 10 to 15 years? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2418.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2420.7200000000003s)]
*  For sure. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2421.84s)]
*  And I think it would be true for a lot longer, but I definitely think it's going to be true [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2423.6s)]
*  for this next period. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2426.4s)]
*  And a lot of what we're doing, we have a fully dedicated research line. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2428.4s)]
*  It's all on interface design. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2432.88s)]
*  What's the flowiest interface? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2435.28s)]
*  What's the best way to work with an AI to produce? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2436.8s)]
*  Because why not give you something that's really wild that never used to happen? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2440.32s)]
*  So in that challenge, go sweet spot. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2443.6800000000003s)]
*  It has to do with your physical appearance? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2446.96s)]
*  Just going to leave it alone. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2451.44s)]
*  Just going to leave it alone. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2452.4s)]
*  I don't even know what I was saying anymore. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2453.84s)]
*  Something that happened, something really wild about AI and flow. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2456.0s)]
*  So sorry, I took you off the game. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2460.16s)]
*  It was going to be the most insightful thing I've ever said. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2464.56s)]
*  In fact, it was like solving for pie and you just screwed it up. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2466.56s)]
*  Sorry, people. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2470.16s)]
*  I was going to solve for pie here. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2470.64s)]
*  So the question is, you've described the flow state as intensely human. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2472.8799999999997s)]
*  As an intensely human stage. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2480.0s)]
*  Well, mammalian, because insects get into flow when birds flocking. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2482.56s)]
*  So it's actually older. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2486.72s)]
*  Fish schooling. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2490.3999999999996s)]
*  So going back to Jarvis, I can imagine Jarvis. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2491.12s)]
*  Oh, interface design. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2494.8799999999997s)]
*  That's what we were talking about. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2495.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2496.72s)]
*  So almost everything. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2497.2799999999997s)]
*  This is one that I was going to tell you about. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2500.16s)]
*  So in that challenge, go sweet spot. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2501.68s)]
*  Anxiety is the upper level. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2504.48s)]
*  So if you overload cognitive load, your brain can hold seven items at once in working memory. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2505.68s)]
*  But that's digits. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2512.7999999999997s)]
*  If you go to something like concepts, most people tap out at three or four. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2513.8399999999997s)]
*  This is why I always say- [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2517.6s)]
*  Which is amazingly low. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2518.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2520.6400000000003s)]
*  To tiny bottle. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2520.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2521.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, people don't get the brain takes in if you go by Marvin Zimmerman's calculations [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2521.84s)]
*  and they're probably way off. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2527.04s)]
*  It's 11 million bits of information from our senses every second. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2528.56s)]
*  That's what they counted, believe it or not. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2532.0s)]
*  Our bandwidth of human attention is 120 bits. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2534.96s)]
*  You're using 60 bits of attention to listen to me talk. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2538.96s)]
*  If we're talking together and there's a faucet dripping- [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2541.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm not noticing it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2543.92s)]
*  Everybody's tapped out, right? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2544.88s)]
*  This is the whole basis of cognitive bias. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2545.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2547.28s)]
*  So one of the things that you've noticed, we talked about it a second ago, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2548.0s)]
*  it used to take you with Google, right? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2551.6s)]
*  To get over, yeah, I've got an answer to a question. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2553.52s)]
*  I need as much data as I possibly can get. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2555.92s)]
*  You could really spend like a couple hours doing your research until you filled up your brain [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2558.4s)]
*  and like pushed yourself into anxiety. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2563.2000000000003s)]
*  That challenge goes sweet spot. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2565.36s)]
*  With chat, GBT or any of the AI systems, you can get such accurate information. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2566.8s)]
*  You can overload cognitive load in five minutes. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2572.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2575.68s)]
*  I've done it where I'm researching something and I'm 10 minutes in and I've literally blown [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2576.8s)]
*  out my brain for most of the day. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2581.84s)]
*  But then you can go to the LLM and say, can you please pull out the five most important concepts [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2583.12s)]
*  that are through- you can use that as a sorting mechanism. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2588.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2591.28s)]
*  But going back, I do imagine that Jarvis can do things, changing music, changing difficulties, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2592.88s)]
*  challenging me that can hit flow triggers and we'll talk about flow triggers later. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2601.92s)]
*  That can push me into flow. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2607.2000000000003s)]
*  Let me read you a quote from Naval Ravincant, who's the CEO of AngelList. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2608.48s)]
*  He recently said in an interview, this whole idea that we can somehow make AI safe is nonsense [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2613.1200000000003s)]
*  because creativity by its nature is unbounded. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2619.28s)]
*  What are your thoughts about becoming AGI, ASI, WAVE? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2624.56s)]
*  And safety there. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2632.0s)]
*  Do you have any preconceived notions? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2634.0s)]
*  That's a good point he's making, by the way. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2636.32s)]
*  This is the whole example of DeepMind with Go, where it comes up with moves you've never seen. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2640.88s)]
*  Move 27, right? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2646.32s)]
*  That is the move that least sort of have never seen before. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2647.36s)]
*  And this notion that AI in our world, and you and I are the ultimate optimists, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2650.96s)]
*  but I can imagine AI in our world doing things that has never been seen or conceived of before [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2658.88s)]
*  and creating some fundamental challenges for us. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2666.0s)]
*  What technology hasn't created fundamental challenges for us? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2669.84s)]
*  This is going back to we are as gods or age of abundance, whatever you want to call it. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2677.6s)]
*  I've said this for a really long time. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2681.44s)]
*  This is one of the things we're going to look at in that book is, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2684.1600000000003s)]
*  I think we have a last mile problem on the road to abundance. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2687.44s)]
*  We've got the technology to raise global standards of living. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2691.12s)]
*  And we've had it for a while. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2693.36s)]
*  We could do this. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2695.52s)]
*  Food, water, energy, healthcare, education, everything. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2696.8s)]
*  It was a done deal probably when we wrote abundance if we wanted to apply ourselves. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2699.68s)]
*  And definitely now, but we're not applying ourselves. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2703.68s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2707.52s)]
*  We have the technology to literally raise global standards of living and it's not happening. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2708.0s)]
*  It's because we haven't figured out. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2712.4s)]
*  Well, let's just say it has been happening just not at a fast enough rate. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2714.24s)]
*  Not at a fast enough rate. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2718.3999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2719.4399999999996s)]
*  And I think the problem is that we haven't learned how to cooperate at scale. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2720.08s)]
*  The only time we cooperate at scale globally around problems is if there's a war and the [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2722.9599999999996s)]
*  success rate there isn't so good or a pandemic. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2728.4799999999996s)]
*  And again, the success rate, like we cooperated for the first month [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2730.56s)]
*  of the pandemic to get us to vaccines and then everybody sort of splintered off and [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2734.0s)]
*  everyone in their own ways. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2737.9199999999996s)]
*  I think that's the group flow, which is the cooperative version of it is, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2739.12s)]
*  I think, going to the basis of that solution or part of that solution, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2745.04s)]
*  at least a way in to look at the question. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2748.08s)]
*  And I've maintained this for a while. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2750.72s)]
*  But when I look at AI, I'm like, what we need to start doing is whatever you're saying. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2752.24s)]
*  We need to have these global conversations. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2756.3199999999997s)]
*  Otherwise, the generation we lose to AI, I think it's going to be worse than the [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2758.88s)]
*  generation we lose to social media. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2763.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2766.08s)]
*  People, this is by the way, this was back in the 90s when early days of, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2766.88s)]
*  my field is altered states of consciousness. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2773.36s)]
*  So psychedelic research has always been part of that. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2775.04s)]
*  And you looked at the drug war and things like that. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2777.76s)]
*  And we, I pretty much was very much for legalization. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2780.1600000000003s)]
*  What the Portugal experiment, sort of that writing was on the wall a while ago. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2782.8s)]
*  People were looking at it and going, God, that might be the way. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2786.8s)]
*  What was the Portugal experiment? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2790.1600000000003s)]
*  Portugal has completely decriminalized everything. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2791.84s)]
*  Everything is legal in Portugal and their drug problem continues to drop and drop and drop and [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2795.12s)]
*  drop and drop. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2800.56s)]
*  So their problems have actually gone away with this happening. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2801.2799999999997s)]
*  So Portugal has been a very radical but interesting global experiment in that. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2806.96s)]
*  And one of the points I think is we were always worried that if you legalize drugs, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2812.64s)]
*  you could lose a generation. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2819.3599999999997s)]
*  Because there's a generation that hasn't prepared to deal with these super addictive substances [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2821.2s)]
*  that are going to be in their lives. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2825.92s)]
*  And the same with social media, that's another super addictive substance that we were not prepared [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2826.96s)]
*  to deal with. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2832.4s)]
*  I think we have to start getting a little ahead of these things. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2834.56s)]
*  I don't think we can just be playing from behind. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2837.6s)]
*  But you know the human brain, it deals with the now and the immediate next moment. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2839.52s)]
*  In which case, I think we're going to have a bumpy next 20 years. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2845.2799999999997s)]
*  But AI can deal with the long term. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2848.48s)]
*  We can partner and say, what are the long term issues? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2850.64s)]
*  It's just that it's the tragedy of the commons. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2854.72s)]
*  Isn't everybody... [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2857.12s)]
*  I mean, most people, when they have sort of dire predictions, it's about this period. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2857.84s)]
*  Maybe that's just because we're naive and we've got a recency bias and we're not thinking too [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2866.88s)]
*  far into the future and we're bad long term planners. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2870.56s)]
*  We're going to do those things. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2872.72s)]
*  Or how do you freestyle from a creative super intelligence? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2874.56s)]
*  How do you think past that? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2878.56s)]
*  So one of the questions is how do we train up the AIs? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2879.6s)]
*  I'm fond of Mogadat's work in which he says, listen... [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2884.16s)]
*  Be kind to the AI. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2887.2s)]
*  Be kind. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2888.08s)]
*  Yeah, AI is our progeny. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2888.48s)]
*  How we feed it, how we train it, how we educate it is the difference between Clark Kent, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2891.12s)]
*  I forget his name from Krypton. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2898.56s)]
*  That young baby landing on earth and becoming Superman because he landed in a good family and [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2901.6s)]
*  was taught values and virtues and became a superhero versus landing in a drug den in [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2906.8799999999997s)]
*  the Bronx and becoming a super villain. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2915.2s)]
*  So that AI can go either directions depending upon how it's trained up. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2918.72s)]
*  You know, Elon said, I want to make train XAI Grok to be maximally curious and maximally truth [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2924.16s)]
*  seeking, which sounds reasonably... [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2933.04s)]
*  Sounds reasonably dangerous like everything that it does to me. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2940.2400000000002s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2943.2000000000003s)]
*  If you said maximally creative, that would be dangerous. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2944.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2946.2400000000002s)]
*  Maximally curious? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2946.88s)]
*  Maximally curious to gather knowledge about what... [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2948.08s)]
*  I mean, his goal is that if you're sufficiently curious, you're going to determine the truth. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2951.36s)]
*  You're going to determine the fundamentals. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2957.7599999999998s)]
*  You'll understand first principles what's going on. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2960.88s)]
*  And maximally truth seeking means you're going to learn to avoid the cognitive biases out there. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2965.36s)]
*  One of the things I'm excited about is the notion that AI could become maximally wise. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2972.6400000000003s)]
*  Have we had this conversation? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2980.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we have. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2981.44s)]
*  And I agree with you on that. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2982.0800000000004s)]
*  I think it's really super interesting. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2983.6000000000004s)]
*  The other question is, and this is the one that... [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2986.7200000000003s)]
*  Why can't we use AI to help us steer us so we don't blow ourselves up with the AI? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2992.8s)]
*  And I think we will eventually, but only when it becomes a digital super intelligence. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=2999.2s)]
*  This was the conversation at the Abundance Summit last year, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3004.08s)]
*  which was, would you rather live in a world a decade from now with digital super intelligence, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3007.2s)]
*  like at a billion-fold increased level of intelligence or without that capability? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3015.12s)]
*  I, for one, would much rather live in a world where this digital super intelligence at this [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3021.7599999999998s)]
*  godlike abilities is there to help us, because we humans are still animalistic in all of our [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3028.08s)]
*  natures. We make stupid decisions, all these cognitive biases. We are short-term thinkers. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3035.2799999999997s)]
*  And a digital super intelligence, almost like in a parental fashion, is there if the head of some [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3043.12s)]
*  large country says, I want to, says to his AI, let's go destroy that country over there. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3052.48s)]
*  At some level of wisdom, the AI says, that's a ridiculous thing to do. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3060.64s)]
*  Why would you want to do that? I'm just going to talk to the other AI and we're going to work out [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3065.76s)]
*  a collaboration. And I do think that that is a viable end state. It's the interim stages between [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3069.92s)]
*  now and then. That's the, of the greatest concern. How would you train up an AI? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3077.92s)]
*  Do you have any, in a sense, from your work? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3085.6800000000003s)]
*  That's an interesting question. I mean, there's Asimov's three laws of robotics, right? There's, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3090.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, maximal kindness. But at the end of the day, kindness in some circumstances means weakness, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3095.6800000000003s)]
*  which could mean, you know, making the wrong decisions that maximizes. What was Spock's [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3104.08s)]
*  statement in Star Trek IV, you know, the good of the one cannot supersede the good of the [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3108.4s)]
*  many. Yeah, something like that. I have to think back to my Star Trek IV. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3114.8s)]
*  I only see them just so I can talk to you about that. I appreciate that. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3122.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they're remarkably, the training, nobody's asked me the training AI question before. I'm [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3126.24s)]
*  going to think about that. Because you're training people, you're training, you know, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3134.08s)]
*  meat sacks all the time. All the time. Yeah. So how would you train an AI? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3138.0s)]
*  The interesting question is, I mean, you're asking essentially like a question about leadership, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3144.3199999999997s)]
*  right? That also, how do you, how can a human lead in a world? Because I mean, I think you're, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3149.04s)]
*  one of the points you made is, is part of it is, we're not just looking at one AI, we're looking at [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3155.7599999999998s)]
*  millions of AIs, possibly, you know, billions, if everybody ends up with their individual AI, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3164.32s)]
*  like we end up with a personal tutor, right? The Neil Stevenson Diamond Age idea that we, we both [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3169.44s)]
*  love. Both love. And talked about in education for a really long time, that AI is going to be [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3176.88s)]
*  with you for your whole life. So everybody's going to have, you know, my Jarvis, my version of Jarvis. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3182.56s)]
*  Your version of Jarvis. So it's really a question of like cooperative AI and cooperative humanity. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3187.04s)]
*  It's not just a singular concept, I don't think. I still don't have any ideas. Maybe the next novel [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3193.44s)]
*  will be a crack at that one. I really think that you should think about that. I'm going to think [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3200.48s)]
*  about that. I'm not kidding. I think maybe, maybe the next sci-fi book is going to be around, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3204.8s)]
*  how do you do that? All right. My next question for you, buddy. How will the development of AI [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3209.44s)]
*  creative capabilities impact research in neuroscience and creativity? So I'd like you, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3214.8s)]
*  if you don't mind, because I, every time you, you speak about this, it's like, it's like biotech porn. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3221.1200000000003s)]
*  What's going on in the brain? What's the dance of the neurochemicals? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3227.52s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about creativity. So this is really interesting. The difference, so one, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3232.48s)]
*  creativity is a trainable skill. So everything I'm talking about, like this is a developmental [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3238.8s)]
*  process. As you become more creative, this is what happens in the brain. But I'm going to speak [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3243.2s)]
*  about it as if it was a fixed thing, but I'm not. It's a learned skill. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3247.7599999999998s)]
*  By the way, the fact that you're making that statement, I think is really important. How do [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3250.56s)]
*  you make that statement? I think is really important. Having a creative mindset, and we'll [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3255.2s)]
*  talk about mindsets, right? Like I am being, first of all, saying to yourself that you're a [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3259.6s)]
*  creative person. Like a lot of people say I'm not creative and they shut it down. And once you shut [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3265.2s)]
*  it down, yes, you're not creative. No, you're not creative. Yes, absolutely. So it's important [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3272.3199999999997s)]
*  people to realize that it is. It's an innately human skill. We're all born with it. And I mean, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3277.3599999999997s)]
*  neurobiologically. Yeah. So this is what's wild. If you're just looking at sort of male and female, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3282.88s)]
*  for example, the differences between, and people ask this all the time with flow, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3292.32s)]
*  are the differences between men and women and flow? And everybody wants those differences to [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3296.88s)]
*  be really great. And they're not. They're microscopic. Like if you look at the brains [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3302.24s)]
*  between men and women, men have more interhemispheric connectivity and women have more [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3306.24s)]
*  connectivity between the hemispheres. But those are not absolutes and they vary. Brains are [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3313.2799999999997s)]
*  creatives. So we have an executive attention network. This allows me to, I'm focusing on [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3319.8399999999997s)]
*  Peter, I'm blocking out all the other distractions, I'm paying attention. That's the executive [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3325.52s)]
*  attention network. I wish my kids would activate that. It doesn't stop fully forming until they're [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3329.2s)]
*  25. It takes a while. It's trainable. And then we have the default mode network, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3334.08s)]
*  which gets a bad rap because rumination lives there, self-referential thinking lives there, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3341.44s)]
*  but so does creativity. And say the network name again. Default mode network. It's where [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3347.2s)]
*  your brain goes when it's mind wandering, daydreaming, imagination. When you're not [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3352.56s)]
*  living in the now. When you're not living in the now, when your brain's taking you somewhere. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3356.3199999999997s)]
*  Rumination is when instead of your brain taking you into creativity, it just thinks about that [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3360.08s)]
*  shitty thing your wife said to you and you just played over and over. That's all the default mode [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3364.88s)]
*  network. Normally, most brains, these networks work in opposition. Can you shut down the default? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3368.88s)]
*  Sure. Meditation, that's one of the main things you're doing. They work in opposition. So as [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3374.96s)]
*  executive attention goes up, you're focused, you're no longer daydreaming. We all know this. So you [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3382.56s)]
*  start daydreaming and you're not focused. They go up and down this way. And it's actually the [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3386.8s)]
*  salience network, which is if I do this, what's that sound? That's the salience network. It switches [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3391.6800000000003s)]
*  between the two. That's what does it. So in the brains of creatives, normally this is opposition. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3397.36s)]
*  They work together. So literally these networks are co-activated. All of them? No, no. The default [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3404.8s)]
*  mode network and the executive attention, they're co-activated. And the salience network, which is [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3410.0s)]
*  the hinge in creatives, this is what really, really happens is it gets extra flexible. So you [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3415.2s)]
*  can flop back and forth and back and forth. So you can go from fully focused to thinking about an idea [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3420.3199999999997s)]
*  and wildly fully focused. I can see that. That's what happens when you're writing. Part of the [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3425.2s)]
*  process of learning how to write is this process of learning to toggle between I need to be focused [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3432.16s)]
*  putting the words in a sentence and oh no, I got to come up with the next line. And it's this back [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3437.7599999999998s)]
*  and forth in the brain. And it gets very, very flexible in the brains of creatives. And flow [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3442.96s)]
*  tends to enhance this communication. It shuts down non-relevant structures, but even the default mode [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3449.84s)]
*  network, which really gets turned off in flow, except for the part of it that's used in creativity. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3455.44s)]
*  So we see really stark differences in the brains of creatives versus non-creatives in a really big [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3460.2400000000002s)]
*  way. It's almost like the changes in a creative brain are, I don't know if I can make this [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3469.76s)]
*  statement across the board. It may not be a blanket statement, but somebody who's been addicted to [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3474.2400000000002s)]
*  coke or drugs for 20 years versus the creative brain know that creative brain actually has more [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3478.96s)]
*  difference than that. It's really profound and you can see it. You can see it on IFMRIs and you can [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3484.4s)]
*  see it on EEGs, network analysis is the brain. Super interesting. Can you go into a little bit [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3491.68s)]
*  about dopamine and the neurotransmitters here? Yeah, the next side of this is the neurotransmitters [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3500.24s)]
*  that are involved in it and dopamine and norepinephrine, which show up, arise at the [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3505.8399999999997s)]
*  front end of a flow state. These are all pleasure drugs and both dopamine and norepinephrine are [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3511.2799999999997s)]
*  focusing chemicals. Norepinephrine is just adrenaline in the brain. Noreadrenaline is what [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3515.92s)]
*  they call it in Europe. We call it norepinephrine. It's essentially adrenaline in the brain, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3521.76s)]
*  but both of these are reward chemicals. But the cool thing they do from a creative perspective is [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3525.84s)]
*  they hide and focus and excitement and attention. When they're in your system, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3530.0s)]
*  you can't not pay attention to something. You see something amazing. You see something, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3533.76s)]
*  a demonstration that's fascinating. You hear something that makes you think. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3539.36s)]
*  When I'm writing a cliffhanger story, when I teach writing, we talk about norepinephrine closes. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3543.2s)]
*  That's what gets you to turn the page. Exactly. Dopamine is the same thing, but you tend to get [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3551.6s)]
*  dopamine from surprise instead of excitement. But the point is that both of those neurochemicals, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3556.9599999999996s)]
*  this is interesting. Creativity is a flow trigger. When you link ideas together, pattern recognition, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3564.0s)]
*  the brain releases dopamine. A little bit of norepinephrine, a lot of dopamine. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3570.56s)]
*  It's fascinating. I can remember moments in time where, like when I was in class and the [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3574.32s)]
*  teacher is trying to teach me something, there's a moment where you don't get it and you're lost. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3580.0s)]
*  At a moment you go, oh, that's what's going on. That's it. That aha moment. My colleagues, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3586.4s)]
*  John Coynos and Mark Beeman, map the aha moment. We know exactly where it is, how it happens. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3594.0s)]
*  And it's really, we'll talk a lot about my favorite part of the brain, the anterior cingulate [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3600.56s)]
*  cortex in a second, because that's where a lot of this is living. You have a big one, don't you? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3604.56s)]
*  I do. So glad you noticed. Once again, you killed me. So dopamine and norepinephrine. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3608.56s)]
*  By the way, dopamine and norepinephrine just had this experience. You do a cross-repulsory [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3623.6s)]
*  Sudoku when that little rush of pleasure get in answers right. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3626.7999999999997s)]
*  That's what is driving video game addictions. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3631.12s)]
*  Check this out because this is another example. You know, like if you've ever done cross-repulsals, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3634.8799999999997s)]
*  you don't tend to just get one answer at a time. Usually they come in flurries. You get two or [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3639.9199999999996s)]
*  three in a row. Why is that? It's because when you get an answer right, the brain puts dopamine [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3643.8399999999997s)]
*  into your system. Dopamine, Titan's Focus does all that other stuff. It enhances signal to noise [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3648.7999999999997s)]
*  ratios. So we find more signal in the noise. We notice more patterns. Why are we more creative [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3654.08s)]
*  in flow? One of the main reasons is because dopamine and norepinephrine both have massively [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3660.72s)]
*  amplified pattern recognition. Now, obviously you take this too high and you get conspiracy [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3665.44s)]
*  theorists and extreme paranoia. It's the same knob, right? It goes from creativity all the way up [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3672.24s)]
*  into conspiracy theories are just linking really disparate ideas together in really creative ways. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3681.44s)]
*  And rationalizing them. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3686.96s)]
*  And rationalizing them. I mean, that's what the brain does. It's a meaning-making machine. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3687.76s)]
*  It will take all kinds of crazy stuff. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3692.2400000000002s)]
*  But that's the point with the conspiracy theories. It's not only a meaning-making machine. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3694.56s)]
*  When we understand meaning, we feel safer. The brain is trying to come like link together those [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3698.48s)]
*  theories. That's a really important point there. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3704.08s)]
*  It's really important. We're always the work. I always say humans are really simple toys. They're [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3705.36s)]
*  really basic level approach, avoid valence and arousal. Those four knobs control like those are [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3710.96s)]
*  the four knobs that control your life. Other neurochemicals in creativity, anandamide, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3717.12s)]
*  same psychoactive that's in marijuana. It's in the endocannabinoid system, right? Which is a sort of [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3724.8s)]
*  a second immune system and a stress response system that massively amplifies lateral thinking. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3730.8s)]
*  The other thing that happens, especially if you're talking about flow in creativity, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3737.28s)]
*  our sense of self turns off in flow. We've talked about this before, but it's the same reason time [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3742.6400000000003s)]
*  passes strangely in flow. Both time and our sense of self are network effects. There are a bunch of [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3749.0400000000004s)]
*  different parts. Most of the prefrontal cortex, sometimes other stuff is working. And in flow, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3753.6000000000004s)]
*  the brain performs an efficiency exchange. It wants as much energy as it can have for [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3759.92s)]
*  focus and attention. So it shuts down non-critical structures and repurposes the energy. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3765.12s)]
*  Huge portions of your prefrontal cortex go down in flow. And as a result, we lose our ability to [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3770.72s)]
*  track time. So past, present and future get pushed together into what poets talk about as [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3777.12s)]
*  the eternal now, right? The moment, the deep now is the psychological. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3783.2799999999997s)]
*  I had that experience. I remember I was speaking somewhere and I was asked extemporaneously to speak [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3787.04s)]
*  about singularity or technology or whatever it was. And I remember I got the mic and had no idea [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3794.88s)]
*  what I was going to say. And I went into a flow state and I was like observing myself saying things [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3805.6800000000003s)]
*  that I really liked. And it was, it was a strangest experience. It was like, I, that was an anchor for [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3814.0s)]
*  me of what a flow state felt like. Well, I mean, every time, I mean, public speaking, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3821.92s)]
*  right? It was one of those flowy experiences on earth. Do you ever, if you have a good speech, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3825.84s)]
*  do you have any idea what you said on stage? Like I'll get to the end of this speech and I'll be [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3830.32s)]
*  like, am I done? What, just what? You know what I mean? And it's fairly, it's fairly common. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3834.56s)]
*  Cause you know, speaking is really flowy. It's got a lot of flow triggers built in. I've done it a [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3841.76s)]
*  lot. So like, you know, I, at this point, I don't, I don't. Yeah. I don't stress about it. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3846.72s)]
*  You go on stage and see whatever materializes materializes. And it's funny. You know, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3852.24s)]
*  my favorite part is at the end of giving a PowerPoint keynote is the Q and A. Oh yeah. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3856.48s)]
*  Right. Because these questions are coming at me and I've heard like almost every question asked, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3861.68s)]
*  but when a new question comes. Oh, so exciting. It is exciting. And I have to pull together [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3867.12s)]
*  like this data point and this data point and come up and it's like, that was a pretty good [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3872.16s)]
*  answer. No, I got to tell you something. It's cause the flow stuff. I've done this for so long. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3876.48s)]
*  I can, if you asked me to speak for 20 minutes, I know what question they're going to, it's going [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3881.36s)]
*  to be my first question. My second one, if you asked me for 40 minutes, I know the first question, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3885.6s)]
*  the second question, cause it's just like, everybody wants to know the next bit of information. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3889.04s)]
*  I've done the 60 minute version of the talk. So I know, you know, in the 90 minute version, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3894.08s)]
*  and it's really funny how that happens, but I'm always excited. That's the great stuff. When [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3898.24s)]
*  somebody, you know, asks you something that kicks your head sideways and you're like, wow, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3902.4799999999996s)]
*  I have no idea. Like my friend, Peter asked me how I was going to train an AI today. I don't know. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3905.68s)]
*  But you're going to figure it out. I'm going to figure it out. Yeah. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3910.72s)]
*  It was about 13 years ago. I had my two kids, my two boys. And I remember at that moment in time, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3912.56s)]
*  I made a decision to double down on my health. Without question, I wanted to see their kids, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3918.64s)]
*  their grandkids. And really, you know, during this extraordinary time where the space frontier and AI [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3925.28s)]
*  and crypto is all exploding, it was like the most exciting time ever to be alive. And I made a [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3931.36s)]
*  decision to double down on my health. And I've done that in three key areas. The first is going [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3936.96s)]
*  every year for a fountain upload. You know, fountain is one of the most advanced diagnostics [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3944.5600000000004s)]
*  and therapeutics companies. I go there, upload myself, digitize myself, about 200 gigabytes of [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3949.36s)]
*  data that the AI system is able to look at to catch disease at inception. You know, look for any [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3955.36s)]
*  cardiovascular, any cancer, neurodegenerative disease, any metabolic disease. These things [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3962.2400000000002s)]
*  are all going on all the time and you can prevent them if you can find them at inception. So super [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3967.76s)]
*  important. So fountain is one of my keys. I make it available to the CEOs of all my companies, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3974.08s)]
*  my family members, because, you know, health is in you wealth. But beyond that, we are a collection [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3979.12s)]
*  of 40 trillion human cells and about another 100 trillion bacterial cells, fungi, viri. And we, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3985.68s)]
*  you know, don't understand how that impacts us. And so I use a company and a product called Viome. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=3993.52s)]
*  And Viome has a technology called meta transcriptomics. It was actually developed [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4000.56s)]
*  in New Mexico, the same place where the nuclear bomb was developed, as a biodefense weapon. And [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4007.04s)]
*  their technology is able to help you understand what's going on in your body to understand which [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4013.6800000000003s)]
*  bacteria are producing which proteins. And as a consequence of that, what foods are your super [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4020.8s)]
*  foods that are best for you to eat? Or what food should you avoid? Right? What's going on in your [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4026.7200000000003s)]
*  oral microbiome? So I use their testing to understand my foods, understand my medicines, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4032.56s)]
*  understand my supplements. And Viome really helps me understand from a biological and data standpoint, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4039.6s)]
*  what's best for me. And then finally, you know, feeling good, being intelligent, moving well is [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4046.4s)]
*  critical, but looking good. When you look yourself in the mirror, saying, you know, I feel great about [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4052.56s)]
*  life is so important. Right? And so a product I use every day, twice a day, is called OneSkin, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4057.36s)]
*  developed by four incredible PhD women that found this 10 amino acid peptide that's able to zap [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4064.8s)]
*  senile cells in your skin and really help you stay youthful in your look and appearance. So for me, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4072.4s)]
*  these are three technologies I love and I use all the time. I'll have my team linked to those in the [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4080.0800000000004s)]
*  show notes down below. Please check them out. Anyway, hope you enjoyed that. Now back to the [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4087.04s)]
*  episode. What should entrepreneurs be focused on in this new AI driven landscape to ensure they [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4091.84s)]
*  develop the right skills? How do you think about that? I mean, you're teaching a group of different [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4098.48s)]
*  entrepreneurs. So, and I'm blending a bunch of things together also. I'm using AI also to teach [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4104.0s)]
*  people how to like work with bias and mindset and framing also woven into that program. Because to [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4114.64s)]
*  me, it's all coupled together, but we can get into that. I just, I don't think it's- Oh, well, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4121.76s)]
*  before we forget, we forgot about the anterior, the ASC, what do you call it? Singular Cortex. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4126.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, the anterior singular cortex. Okay. Yeah. Let's go there. I want to understand your favorite [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4134.240000000001s)]
*  part of your brain. Let's go there. So the ACC is really interesting because it's the part of your [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4137.92s)]
*  brain that does pattern recognition versus lateral thinking. So it decides you're facing a problem. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4143.44s)]
*  Is it going to be super creative and come up with this wild solution or is it going to give me [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4150.639999999999s)]
*  safe, tried and true? And the lever is actually anxiety. The more anxiety in your system- [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4154.879999999999s)]
*  You go to safe. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4160.48s)]
*  The more you want the safe, secure, tried and true. This is why I always tell people [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4161.12s)]
*  for hiring, you always hire two people. You hire the person they are normally, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4166.96s)]
*  the person they are when they're afraid and they're radically different people. And it's [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4171.76s)]
*  because of the ACC. And I always in hiring, I try to like, there's always a trial period if you want [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4175.4400000000005s)]
*  to come work with me and I will stress you out in that trial period in such a way, because I want to [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4182.08s)]
*  see how you're going to be when you're scared and you're failing. Because we're going to be in that [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4187.6s)]
*  situation. I'm an entrepreneur. Shit's going to go wrong. You're not going to need you to be able [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4192.96s)]
*  to be at your creative best and stay calm and do all that stuff. For years, I like to hire [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4197.679999999999s)]
*  action sport athletes, professional action sport athletes for this very reason, because they're [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4202.16s)]
*  used to staying very calm in making good decisions in extreme situations. Same thing with hiring out [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4207.679999999999s)]
*  of the military. You get the same thing. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4213.92s)]
*  Yeah. Going back to, so a lot of folks who are listening or watching this right now are [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4215.679999999999s)]
*  entrepreneurs. And I think there's no entrepreneur on the planet that isn't diving deep into AI right [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4223.04s)]
*  now in some way, shape or form. It may just be- [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4229.44s)]
*  I've seen three, I've seen three trends. I see the trend with like a lot of creatives where they're [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4231.92s)]
*  just like, fuck this. I want nothing to do with it. They were told it was going to make them more [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4236.96s)]
*  productive or blah, blah, blah, blah. And they tried it. It didn't work the way they thought. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4241.2s)]
*  And they've walked away. There's a second group. And this is, I fit into this category. And it's [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4244.64s)]
*  one of the reasons I'm creating the Alliance is to solve this problem for myself also is I'm like, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4252.48s)]
*  I like to really get great with my tools. So when I taught myself how to draw for the first year [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4259.5199999999995s)]
*  and a half, I just drew in charcoal. Then I added in ink, like black ink. And it's now like four [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4266.08s)]
*  years in. So like I do the same thing with AI. I'm really great with Chet GBT and some of the [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4273.5199999999995s)]
*  large language models. I'm okay with some of the drawing programs, but like you get into the audio [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4280.24s)]
*  and the video stuff and I suck. I mean, I've got a handful of tools I'm good at. And then there's [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4286.4s)]
*  people like, you know, our friend Mike Koenig, who like every new AI tool that comes out, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4293.679999999999s)]
*  Mike has figured out how do you use it? How do you monetize it? How do you, you know, use it to [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4300.0s)]
*  problem solve for you? How do you blend it with other AIs? That's what I think. It's a gap, right? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4304.4s)]
*  Because the more we get towards like a super intelligent AI, you're just going to have one [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4311.2s)]
*  system. Now you have a whole bunch of different tools you have to learn. And it's a little more [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4315.28s)]
*  complicated. And this is for my mind where the creativity and the, I'm sorry, the curiosity [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4320.08s)]
*  mindset comes in. Yeah, that's exactly what I was about to say. My experience with all of it, my [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4324.48s)]
*  advice. And this is what I was told to do. And I came to, I didn't come to AI through all this stuff. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4329.6s)]
*  I came in as a scientist. We've been using machine learning and a whole bunch of stuff in flow [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4336.08s)]
*  research for 20 years now. So I came in thinking, how do we use machine learning? How do we use AI [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4341.360000000001s)]
*  to help us do better science? And then moved it into other things. But I think you have to, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4347.92s)]
*  people are so intimidated or so they've made up their mind that they forget that the simplest [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4353.4400000000005s)]
*  thing to do is this is what somebody told to me. They were like, they don't go prompt this, play [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4359.44s)]
*  with the fucking system. Just get on the system. It's free. Play. Yes. Ask the system to teach you [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4365.04s)]
*  how to use the system. And I just, the same approach, one of the coolest things, one of the [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4371.759999999999s)]
*  reasons I like teaching myself to draw, I think everybody, so one, microdosing with creativity [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4375.44s)]
*  between tasks. What do you microdose with? With creativity. So I'll be focused on my book, right? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4381.04s)]
*  And then I've got a meeting and I've got a five minute block. If you're in flow, you don't want [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4388.48s)]
*  your prefrontal cortex to turn my mind on. So what do you need to avoid? Anything emotional, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4394.08s)]
*  anything that'll get your ego fired up because the ego lives right there. So all social media is [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4398.799999999999s)]
*  no good because it's probably going to get a rise out of you or do something and mess with that [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4404.48s)]
*  system. There's limited things. A lot of people like low grade physical activity. And sometimes [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4408.48s)]
*  I'll do that. I'll go for a walk or things like that. But I like like a 10 minute drawing thing [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4413.5199999999995s)]
*  or whatever. And what I love, and this is the approach I take with AI, is no, people don't run [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4418.799999999999s)]
*  this experiment. And it's fascinating. If you do something 10 minutes a day, just 10 minutes a day, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4425.84s)]
*  but you do it for a year, you're going to get excellent. You'll still, it's amazing. It's the [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4431.2s)]
*  coolest thing in the world to like, I've watched. So what would you do with, what would you do for [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4436.24s)]
*  10 minutes a day that you haven't been doing right now? The next, once I get my drawing to sort of [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4440.88s)]
*  where it wants, I've already got a piano in my office. And that's the next one is I'm going to [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4447.44s)]
*  move into teaching myself how to play music. And yes, I know pretty soon the AI is going to be able [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4451.759999999999s)]
*  to do it for me and everything else. But I still believe that by training up my skills and training [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4457.44s)]
*  up my consciousness raising skills at the same time, me working with AI is going to be better [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4463.36s)]
*  than without. Like the combination, the combinations would be better. And I, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4470.96s)]
*  I still think like what you've been asking is, Hey, Steven, I'm really, really fucking smart. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4475.5199999999995s)]
*  And I cooperate with AI. At what point is the AI going to replace me? Right? At what point is [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4481.5199999999995s)]
*  the AI going to be better than just Peter and the AI together, Steven and the AI together? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4486.08s)]
*  And I'm hoping the answer is not in our lifetime. That's what I'm hoping the answer is. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4490.64s)]
*  Ooh, I have a hard time believing it. I have a hard time believing it too. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4495.92s)]
*  I think AI, the challenge is we humans have all these cognitive biases. We have a limited [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4499.04s)]
*  font of knowledge. We bias the output that an AI. I want to talk about this for a half a second. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4504.24s)]
*  We do all those things, but people don't understand that. So that's back into creativity [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4512.0s)]
*  for a second. Sure. Creativity is a recombinatory process, right? The brain takes a novel [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4518.4s)]
*  information, connects it to older ideas. It bursts something startlingly new. So we already [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4523.12s)]
*  talked about the fact that you got, you're taking 11 million bits a second, but you're only like [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4529.599999999999s)]
*  getting 120 bits. And we've talked about the negativity bias. That means nine negative bits [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4533.52s)]
*  of information for every one positive bit that gets through. And most of the negative stuff [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4538.4800000000005s)]
*  is older patterns. It's other, it's fierce, right? We're scared of it because we've seen it before [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4543.6s)]
*  and it's gone wrong. So it's not new information. It's not the stuff that feeds creativity, right? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4548.080000000001s)]
*  One of the reasons that I like a gratitude practice is so helpful is it'll tune it down to like five [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4553.120000000001s)]
*  or six negative bits for every positive bit that gets through. So it basically doubles your novelty [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4558.56s)]
*  input. But those, if you want to mess around with those things, people don't realize this. Yes, bias [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4564.0s)]
*  is unconscious. Our frames are often unconscious, though you can make them conscious and mindset [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4571.4400000000005s)]
*  from a lot of people, it's unconscious unless somebody like you or me has made it conscious [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4579.280000000001s)]
*  for them, right? But people don't realize these are knobs, these are tuning knobs. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4584.32s)]
*  Yes. You can control the novelty, the information you're taking in by messing with bias and framing [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4589.36s)]
*  and mindset. What I remind people of is, listen, our brains are large language models. They're [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4596.719999999999s)]
*  neural nets. Yes. And how do you train a neural net? By showing it repeated data after data after [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4602.32s)]
*  data so that the connections that are made reflect the data. And if, you know, let's talk [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4608.88s)]
*  about mindsets. You know, I talk about an abundance mindset, an exponential mindset, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4617.28s)]
*  a moonshot mindset, you know, a longevity mindset, gratitude mindset, curiosity mindset are the ones [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4621.76s)]
*  that I care about and a purpose driven mindset, most of all. And I think about the notion that [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4628.96s)]
*  people can train those mindsets by selectively choosing who they hang out with, what they read, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4634.48s)]
*  what they listen to, what they watch. All of that is data coming into your 100 billion neurons, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4642.879999999999s)]
*  100 trillion synaptic connections that is forming the neural connections. And that's massively [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4648.24s)]
*  powerful. It's jumping to mindsets for a moment. And I want to just talk about something you and I [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4655.839999999999s)]
*  have discussed a lot, which is basically the notion that we have a default negative [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4663.04s)]
*  fear and scarcity mindset. By the way, ACC, it's part of the brain we were talking about before. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4672.72s)]
*  Yes. This is exactly where like the scarcity mindset is going to do its most damage. Because [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4676.88s)]
*  literally by having the scarcity mindset, you're telling your brain, give me logical, give me safe, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4683.2s)]
*  give me secure, give me something that's worked a million times before. That's what you're saying [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4690.4s)]
*  to your brain. You're basically keeping your brain in hunter gatherer mode. It doesn't matter that [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4694.879999999999s)]
*  you're living in the 21st century. If that scarcity mindset, that fear based mindset, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4700.24s)]
*  you're keeping your brain. How does the ACC relate to the amygdala? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4704.48s)]
*  It's directly connected. So it directly fits. The amygdala is the next connection down basically. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4708.96s)]
*  And for those who don't know, the amygdala is an almond size piece of the brain of two of them. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4716.16s)]
*  Everything you see, hear, and feel, all the data you collect goes to the amygdala. It's your early [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4722.48s)]
*  warning center. We talked about that in abundance. So we've got a challenge, which is people quickly [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4727.12s)]
*  fall into a doom mindset around AI. Yeah. And by the way, the curiosity [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4736.08s)]
*  mindset is your cure here. Until you play with it, it's scary. Once you start playing with it, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4742.56s)]
*  you're like, oh wow, I see how this is working. I see how this is augmenting what I can do. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4751.52s)]
*  The things that were frustrating me earlier, I don't think those frustrations have yet gone away, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4757.360000000001s)]
*  but you start figuring out what the system is good at, what it's not good at, what it can do. I was [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4761.76s)]
*  laughing about the conversation I had with your wife last night where we were talking about, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4768.96s)]
*  how do you get one of these drawing programs to render a person far in the distance? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4773.52s)]
*  And there's a lot of really basic stuff like that that still doesn't work. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4779.04s)]
*  And really answer your question. It's okay. But let's talk about the mindset side of the equation [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4784.88s)]
*  here, because I think the point you just made that you can tune your mindset is I want everybody to [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4788.72s)]
*  get that message. How do you think about mindset? So I want to back up because [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4794.0s)]
*  this is almost funny. So a lot of my mindset knowledge came out of, I want to say it was in [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4800.8s)]
*  FASTER when we were writing FASTER together. The full name is Futures FASTER. Futures FASTER, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4806.96s)]
*  you think. When we were writing that. By the way, I'm still pissed that the publisher had us change [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4812.4s)]
*  the name from Convergence. Convergence. So it should have been Convergence. I mean, it was [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4816.56s)]
*  Abundance Bold Convergence. The ABCs. I'm with you. So I don't want the publisher to drive the name [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4821.04s)]
*  of our next book. No, of course not. Of course not. Okay. By the way, whatever power you think you [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4829.12s)]
*  have in the world, publish a book and find out how little it really is. But so five years ago, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4836.24s)]
*  six years ago when we started having the mindset thing, this was around the time people were talking [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4845.76s)]
*  about a bunch of different mindsets. I thought it was bullshit. I was like, okay, I know there's a [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4851.04s)]
*  growth mindset and a fixed mindset and there's like, you can see neurobiological differences [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4854.56s)]
*  between the two. And I kind of figured the scarcity mindset was going to be a hyperactive amygdala [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4859.6s)]
*  and an unactive ACC because that made sense. But I didn't think these other things. It turns out [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4864.8s)]
*  they're all real. Like their neurological phenomenon. I was wrong. You were totally right. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4870.72s)]
*  Let me say that again. I was wrong. You were totally right. We can open the episode with that. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4876.16s)]
*  Because I mean, what is this the first time in 30 years? But that these mindsets exist and [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4881.92s)]
*  they exist and they're real. They're neurobiological phenomenon and you can train them. And it's like, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4886.88s)]
*  like, as you like thinking it's information coming in, connecting it to older ideas, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4893.6s)]
*  we were already talking about training of pattern recognition system. Like you're literally, if you, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4900.64s)]
*  the thing that I always point out to people is if you don't learn to play your brain, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4905.52s)]
*  your brain is going to play you. Right? Like you can't, it's one way or the other, either [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4911.84s)]
*  you're going to be kind of driving or it's going to do the driving. And I like [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4916.56s)]
*  left my own devices. It's bad up here. As a general rule, it's bad up here. Like one of the [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4922.56s)]
*  reasons I got into the flow work and all the work I do is because under normal conditions, not safe. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4927.280000000001s)]
*  How much have you listened to Eckhart Tolle's work at the power of now? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4935.6s)]
*  So, I mean, I've, I know it and all of it. You have to remember that I was living in monasteries [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4941.04s)]
*  and I've been meditating since 1986. Have you figured it out? No, I still have. Like, in fact, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4947.28s)]
*  by the way, a funny story about meditation. I had been meditating for 20 years, 25 years. Friends of [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4953.599999999999s)]
*  mine built a neuro marketing company. They were doing movie trailers and they bought an FMRI. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4962.16s)]
*  They bought a three chip FMRI. It was done in San Diego and I went and they had done a bunch of [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4968.5599999999995s)]
*  work with meditating monks and Buddhist monks and Francis and nuns and things like that. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4972.5599999999995s)]
*  And I made them put me in the FMRI to brain image me while I was meditating. I was so sure I was [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4976.8s)]
*  doing it wrong. I was like, I don't know. I've been doing this for 20 years and like nothing. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4982.96s)]
*  I mean, I can, yes, I can focus and I can chat for eight hours a time and I can sit in the full [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4989.6s)]
*  lotus for a couple hours at a time and whatever. But like, where are the fireworks? And I was so [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4993.68s)]
*  sure I was doing it wrong. Like I got out of the bedroom. He's like, no, Steven, you prayed. Like, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=4998.8s)]
*  he showed it to me. My brain looked exactly like long-term monks because I'd been meditating at [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5002.4s)]
*  that point for 25 years. The hairdo looks like the hairdo. Yeah, part of the equation. Yeah. So [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5006.799999999999s)]
*  turns out I'm doing it right. Well, congratulations. Yeah. So I mean, when I came to like all that [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5012.16s)]
*  stuff with Eckhart Tolle and whatever, I was like, well, yeah, okay. I mean, okay. Yeah. You're just [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5017.04s)]
*  saying the same thing. People have been saying for a very long time. What is really exciting to me [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5021.759999999999s)]
*  now though is, and people don't even think about this. When I started this work in the 90s, there [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5026.32s)]
*  were a bunch of us. Rick Doblin was who founded MAPS was advocating for psychedelics. Richie Davidson [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5031.68s)]
*  and Dan Goldman. And I was at the University of Wisconsin, Richie was at the University of [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5038.240000000001s)]
*  Wisconsin, starting in on meditation. My mentor, Dr. Andrew Newberg was looking at like, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5041.4400000000005s)]
*  stranger spiritual and mystical experiences, speaking in tongues. And we were all interested [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5047.12s)]
*  in altered states of consciousness, different things in the brain from different angles. And [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5051.4400000000005s)]
*  you couldn't even do this research. Like you couldn't get funding. We had to prove, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5056.64s)]
*  I was just talking about this with Andy Newberg, we had to spend like 1990 to 1996, almost everybody [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5062.320000000001s)]
*  in this field, we had to prove that religion was good for you. That was literally the, it was the [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5067.92s)]
*  wet, that was the wedge issue. Everything we're looking at in the consciousness revolution, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5073.360000000001s)]
*  nobody remembers this. But after Skinner, you couldn't talk about consciousness at all. You [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5076.64s)]
*  couldn't even bring it up out loud. Christophe Conch, who we're going to be with in a couple of [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5082.24s)]
*  weeks, was the, he was the first person to stand up and talk about it out loud. And he could do it [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5086.48s)]
*  because he partnered with Craig, who invented the, you know, discovered DNA. And you couldn't, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5092.96s)]
*  because of that, you couldn't mess with him. So that was sort of, that was the wedge issue [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5099.36s)]
*  into consciousness. But it was spirituality is good for you. We had to prove that spirituality [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5102.96s)]
*  was good for you. It was health benefits, right? Because people who go to church, there's pro-social [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5108.32s)]
*  neurochemistry, there, maybe there's stuff from spirituality, but there's a bunch of stuff. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5114.5599999999995s)]
*  And we had to prove that was good for you. And then scientists were like, oh, okay, religion's [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5118.16s)]
*  good for you. We can fund this now, the National Institute of Health suddenly got involved in all [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5123.92s)]
*  that stuff. This, that was our wedge issue. It was the dumb, we literally, the whole field spent like [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5127.84s)]
*  six years trying to prove that this stuff was good for you, just so we could get funding [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5133.599999999999s)]
*  to do the kind of the basic research that we wanted to really do, which is, oh no, meditation [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5138.08s)]
*  is good for you and flow is good for you. And psychedelics are really useful tools for treating [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5143.04s)]
*  X, Y, and Z. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5148.4s)]
*  Do you remember that movie Altered States? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5149.2s)]
*  Sure. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5151.2s)]
*  Love that. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5151.92s)]
*  Sure. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5152.4s)]
*  So I- [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5152.72s)]
*  John Lilly, that was the John Lilly story. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5153.92s)]
*  Have you done ketamine in a sensory deprivation take? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5155.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5159.12s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5159.28s)]
*  Don't you want to? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5160.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes, very much so. Very much so. John, you know, he nearly drowned doing that. His wife had to [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5161.44s)]
*  revive him at one point because it didn't go so well. But yes, I would love to do that. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5167.4400000000005s)]
*  We'll put straps in place. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5171.76s)]
*  I just, we need minders, but yes, like we're going to get a float tank and we're going to try [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5173.2s)]
*  ketamine in a float tank and redo. And when we wake up- [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5177.28s)]
*  Would you do ketamine there or- [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5179.76s)]
*  That's what John Lilly was doing. That Altered States was actually based on ketamine. He was [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5182.16s)]
*  doing ketamine. And I think the reason is duration, right? Because DMT, it might be a more [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5185.76s)]
*  interesting experience, but it's really going to be fast. And ketamine, at least you get, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5195.12s)]
*  you know, a nine, with a good IV push, you can get 90 minutes of weirdness. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5199.84s)]
*  All right. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5205.12s)]
*  Yes, by the way, this is Peter and Stephen on a national pod. Yes, making a plan. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5207.36s)]
*  You were the first person ever to speak to me about DMT. And I was just so fascinated. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5213.12s)]
*  You told me about basically people on a DMT journey going and experiencing alien- [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5220.64s)]
*  Yeah, it was the original Rick Stossman's, that was Rick's original work, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5227.52s)]
*  which is the University of New Mexico. When he was doing inner Vetus. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5231.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was continuous IV- [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5235.76s)]
*  Continuous IV DMT. And it wasn't, they weren't getting like- [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5237.12s)]
*  Was this the God molecule? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5241.52s)]
*  It was the God molecule. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5242.8s)]
*  Yeah, I read that book. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5243.6s)]
*  No, the God molecule was VMAT2. VMAT2 is the, oh, that was the God gene. No, maybe the God [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5244.24s)]
*  molecule is DMT, right? VMAT2 is the God gene. People who have the VMAT2 gene. Turns out this [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5252.16s)]
*  was another thing that came out, same era, the 1990s, things we had to prove to do the work we're [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5257.36s)]
*  doing. Dean Hammer, who was at the NIH, found VMAT2, which is a gene that codes for norepinephrine, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5262.16s)]
*  dopamine, and I want to say serotonin, but I may, the third one may be wrong. The name is all the [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5269.76s)]
*  molecules that show up in your system when you're having spiritual experiences, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5275.280000000001s)]
*  and so the experiences flow states, all that stuff. There's a very specific, so he called it [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5278.16s)]
*  the God gene. He was also the guy- [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5283.12s)]
*  Wait, wait, so people who have this gene are more likely to have- [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5284.8s)]
*  They are more likely to have spiritual experiences because they produce more dopamine, [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5288.56s)]
*  nor epinephrine, and I want to say it's serotonin. So they have higher baseline [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5292.400000000001s)]
*  neurochemical levels, and they have more deeper spiritual, mystical, altered states experiences. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5295.92s)]
*  Fascinating. But the God molecule, that was Rick, and he was doing, and the alien stuff [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5303.04s)]
*  was interesting, right? Because they were in a hospital, and instead of getting the machine [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5308.4800000000005s)]
*  elves and the things that are much more standard in the DMT literature, they were people who were [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5312.8s)]
*  literally seeing Grey Man and having experiments performed on them, and it was a horrific, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5318.32s)]
*  you read about the original work in the hospital, you're like, well, it tells you everything you [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5324.48s)]
*  need to know about setting, setting, right? But- [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5328.24s)]
*  Yeah, setting matters a lot. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5330.24s)]
*  A lot. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5331.599999999999s)]
*  I want to go into cognitive biases for a moment because I think it's really important, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5333.12s)]
*  and then work into your most recent work. We wrote about this, and you introduced me to cognitive [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5339.28s)]
*  biases first, and thank you for that. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5345.759999999999s)]
*  These are your cognitive biases? This is your bias against Stephen? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5348.639999999999s)]
*  No, I learned about cognitive biases when back in 2010, we started writing abundance. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5352.8s)]
*  Abundance, yeah, yeah. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5357.84s)]
*  And they're really incredibly important for people to realize, and that we, the brain, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5359.200000000001s)]
*  as you said, is deluged by information, and our ability to process that information is through a [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5366.56s)]
*  very thin straw, and so our brains evolve these heuristics, these shortcuts, and there's like a [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5373.200000000001s)]
*  familiarity bias, like- [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5379.84s)]
*  Well, common sense, I mean, that's the most, right, common sense is when it works, right? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5381.6s)]
*  That's not a cognitive bias, but that's a heuristic for how do you process a fuckload [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5385.280000000001s)]
*  of information really, really quickly and make an intelligent decision. If it works, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5389.6s)]
*  it's called common sense. When your decision doesn't work, it was your confirmation bias [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5392.96s)]
*  or your recency bias, or there's, if you go to Wikipedia at this point, or the DSM, there's like [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5397.04s)]
*  500, there's 600- [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5403.120000000001s)]
*  Wikipedia is crazy. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5404.320000000001s)]
*  It's an insane list. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5405.360000000001s)]
*  Really weird names, but the ones that are, people should realize is there is a recency [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5406.64s)]
*  bias, like you hear our podcast conversation now, we say something that perhaps contradicts [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5411.28s)]
*  something you heard a month ago or a year ago, you're likely to believe what we are telling you now, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5417.36s)]
*  or there's a familiarity bias, which is when someone looks like you, dresses like you, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5422.88s)]
*  speaks like you, you're tending to give higher value to that person, and then there's this [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5426.88s)]
*  negativity bias, which is the crisis news network, you know, that you value negative information [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5431.84s)]
*  far more than positive information. And these are, they're dangerous in one regard, because [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5438.48s)]
*  they can trick you into making really stupid decisions. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5446.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, racism, massage, all these things are essentially the same version. These are biases, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5451.28s)]
*  right? And it's the same sort of information processing issue. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5457.759999999999s)]
*  The thing I want to back up one step to the idea that we talked about before, because it's just so [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5464.4s)]
*  important to me, which is you are not, you don't have to be the victim of your brain. These are all, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5469.4400000000005s)]
*  like, yes, you have all these biases, but you can train them down significantly. And, and by the way, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5477.04s)]
*  one of the, we, both of us do this all the time. One of the best uses of AI at this point is help me [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5484.8s)]
*  see past my biases. What am I not looking at? I can't wait for AI to, you know, again, if you think [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5491.04s)]
*  about Jarvis as the example where it's on your body, in your body, it's around you all the time, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5497.84s)]
*  it is your constant coach, right? And you can eventually turn on and say, you know, Jarvis, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5503.92s)]
*  turn on cognitive bias alert, and it will have heard everything you've ever seen. You're going to [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5511.92s)]
*  give, I think personally, you're going to give your AI permission to read all your emails, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5517.92s)]
*  listen to your conversations. Well, to me, that's one of the biggest problems with the AI systems [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5521.76s)]
*  right now is their memories aren't robust enough. But we've gotten to, we've gotten to long context [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5526.64s)]
*  memories. We're there now. We're there now. Okay. And so you'll be able, you will hear a piece of data [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5531.52s)]
*  and start making a decision and your AI will be able to say to you, listen, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5540.4s)]
*  your cognitive biases are driving in this direction, but in reality, you heard this and [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5545.04s)]
*  this and this. Let's talk about it. Yeah. Again, like it's, that's, it's why I'm training people, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5550.32s)]
*  like we're training, I mean, I'm training creativity with AI. I just want to skill [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5559.12s)]
*  creatives up so they're no longer scared. And these are the, these are the tools and some of [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5561.84s)]
*  the whiz bang stuff that where you can do, like, it's really easy to get under the hood on Chach [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5566.72s)]
*  ABT at the front end and like tune, nobody does that, but it's really, it's a really simple [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5570.96s)]
*  dashboard and there's a lot of power there, especially for these kinds of things. But I, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5575.4400000000005s)]
*  I think that's a really, it's huge. It's also frames, which are what, you know, they're very, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5579.68s)]
*  frames are very local. And you know, the, the, the, the framing isn't is mindsets are more [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5586.8s)]
*  durational and frames are essentially like when you're building up your abundance mindset, right? [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5594.4s)]
*  How do you do that is by reframing moment by moment basis, constantly for the abundant frame. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5600.4s)]
*  And eventually when it becomes a little more unconscious, we call it a mindset, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5608.08s)]
*  right? And when it becomes totally deep, it becomes a bias board. You know, we don't have a, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5611.68s)]
*  we don't have a word for positive biases, but that's, it's really like, it's darkening the [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5616.8s)]
*  frame. That's fully conscious and goes all the way to a quick example is when you're looking for [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5621.84s)]
*  a parking spot and you have to block, you have to, you have to park like three blocks away. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5625.76s)]
*  You can be pissed about that or you can flip it and say, Oh, I get some free exercise. I get [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5632.56s)]
*  part of my 10,000 steps. Um, I mean, that's that judo move is, is really, so here's something, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5636.8s)]
*  here's this crazy experiment. Uh, they did it at Harvard and they wanted to know what was more [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5643.28s)]
*  effective against anxiety, mindfulness, breath work, or reframing. And, uh, they did a study [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5648.72s)]
*  where they found literally like, because anxiety and curiosity and excitement are the same [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5655.76s)]
*  neurochemical, they're all norepinephrine, right? A little bit is curiosity. A little bit more is [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5664.320000000001s)]
*  excitement too much as anxiety, right? None is boredom, right? I'm not curious. I'm not curious. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5670.08s)]
*  None is boredom, right? I'm not curious. I'm not interested, right? That's literally, it's a spectrum [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5676.32s)]
*  and a lot of people don't realize that that anxiety, when you feel anxiety, it's much [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5681.44s)]
*  easier to turn anxiety into excitement than it is to get rid of it. So, yeah, so this was the [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5689.28s)]
*  experiment they did at Harvard. When you're feeling anxious, this was the experiment. They had people [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5694.8s)]
*  say, I'm excited. I am excited. I'm excited. Three times out loud. And it was more effective [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5699.2s)]
*  than seven minutes of breath work and meditation and reducing stress levels. Here's something crazy. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5705.44s)]
*  This is, this is the wild one. You want to talk about like misogyny and culture and like weird [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5710.639999999999s)]
*  stuff. So they did this experiment about 15 years ago and they found that women in the study group [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5715.599999999999s)]
*  who were over 40 had no idea what excitement felt like because women were not supposed to get too [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5720.48s)]
*  excited and feel too much emotions. So they had repressed excitement so much. They didn't actually [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5727.759999999999s)]
*  realize that when they did this study, there was this whole training for women now that like has [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5733.2s)]
*  to separate anxiety from excitement and be like, these are the same. Like they feel the same. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5738.4s)]
*  And it's okay to be excited. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5744.0s)]
*  It's okay to be excited. Yeah, it's wild. So the point there is culture can come in so heavily, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5745.04s)]
*  you know what I mean? And tilt your brain that you literally can't even recognize a core emotion. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5753.5199999999995s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5759.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5760.0s)]
*  Buddy, let's turn to Flow and your work. The Flow research collective is really just [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5761.12s)]
*  blown up. You've trained tens of thousands of people and you've been at some of the [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5767.36s)]
*  biggest companies like Google. You're just at Google. Can you speak to that a little bit? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5773.2s)]
*  I think I can't speak to Google because I think I signed it on the NDA. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5780.08s)]
*  So what do you do when you're training these? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5784.24s)]
*  So you can get really whiz bang about a lot of stuff and there's a million different things [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5786.32s)]
*  here, but it's varies. As far as Flow training is concerned, I always say there's like five or six, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5792.4s)]
*  what I call the peak performance basics. This is all the stuff we know. You got to sleep seven, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5798.8s)]
*  eight hours a night. Flow is a high energy state, for example. So you need that. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5803.76s)]
*  And do you, by the way? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5807.28s)]
*  Yeah, I always sleep seven. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5808.96s)]
*  What time do you go to sleep? What time do you wake up? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5810.0s)]
*  I go to sleep somewhere between eight and nine and I wake up somewhere between three and four. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5812.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5818.32s)]
*  Every day. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5818.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, do the math. That's barely seven hours. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5819.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's about seven and a half. Seven and a half is what I usually come in at. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5821.36s)]
*  Did you always go to sleep at that time? [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5825.759999999999s)]
*  No, but I always woke up early. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5829.2s)]
*  I think that's an important point. I wrote about that in Longevity Guidebook. It's like the only [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5833.5199999999995s)]
*  way to maintain a sleep schedule is when you go to sleep because your body is likely to wake up [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5837.6s)]
*  at the same time. But when I was in college, graduate school, medical school, I would do my [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5843.4400000000005s)]
*  best work at 1 a.m., 2 a.m. and- [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5849.84s)]
*  And it switched. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5852.88s)]
*  And it switched. Yeah, it flipped for me. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5853.92s)]
*  Yeah. I was probably the same thing, though I was also good in the morning. I'm good late at night, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5856.240000000001s)]
*  too. There's gaps in between. One of the things I always tell people, and this is really important, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5865.52s)]
*  it's really hard in the modern work environment, there are extreme larks. You and I are extreme [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5870.64s)]
*  larks. We get up early. That's when our brain is most awake and most alert. Most people [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5875.68s)]
*  are on the normal work schedule. Most people's brains start to wake up around eight o'clock and [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5881.040000000001s)]
*  their peak concentrations is between nine and 10, 1030. Then there are night owls. I'm married to [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5885.52s)]
*  a night owl. It's really fun. When Joy- [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5894.56s)]
*  What time does Joy go to sleep? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5897.84s)]
*  She's working on a book. She'll start writing at four o'clock in the afternoon and go to four [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5899.52s)]
*  in the morning and she'll go to sleep when I'm waking up. Yeah, which is complicated. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5904.160000000001s)]
*  I'll leave it at that. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5912.64s)]
*  Complicated. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5913.360000000001s)]
*  We're talking about the seven things. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5916.080000000001s)]
*  Well, I was going to say is you can't fight your circadian rhythms. You want to try to work in [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5919.52s)]
*  accordance with your circadian rhythms and the people who get screwed in the modern world that [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5923.28s)]
*  way are the night owls. The world isn't built for them at all. Basically, you have to tune your [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5927.92s)]
*  nervous system every day. I always tell people, if you have five minutes, do a gratitude list. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5937.5199999999995s)]
*  If you have six minutes, read a novel. If you have seven minutes, seven to 11, do breath work. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5944.24s)]
*  11 to 15 or so, 20, go for a walk in nature. If you've got 20, get some exercise, 20 minutes or [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5952.639999999999s)]
*  40 minutes, get some exercise or take a long sauna. We have a full list of these are the ways to [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5961.84s)]
*  reboot your nervous system and reboot your brain and everybody wants to say, oh, I'm too busy. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5971.28s)]
*  I will tell people that depending on your anxiety level, so if you worked at the Flow Research [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5976.96s)]
*  Collective during COVID, we were a high performance organization training people [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5980.96s)]
*  in high performance and I wanted my team at their best, but it was COVID and it was especially in [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5984.72s)]
*  the beginning, everybody was scared and I said, look, if you're going to keep your job at the Flow [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5990.08s)]
*  Research Collective, you have to do three of these a day, minimum three things to tune up your nervous [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5993.2s)]
*  system a day because everybody was so stressed. I was making sure of it, but you have to do that [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=5998.96s)]
*  every day. Yeah, Arianna Huffington will be at Abundance 360 this March along with you [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6005.6s)]
*  and she'll be speaking about the work she's doing and helping employees with these [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6013.84s)]
*  small micro nudges through the day, including gratitude. Yeah, but anyway, so there's a bunch [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6020.56s)]
*  of that stuff and then the other things you would train just to answer your question, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6026.4800000000005s)]
*  there's 28 known flow triggers, preconditions that lead to more flow. There are [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6030.08s)]
*  12 on the individual side and 16 or so on the group flow side. There's a lot of overlap between [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6034.5599999999995s)]
*  the triggers, but what do I train people in? These are the 28 flow triggers and then the [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6041.76s)]
*  only other thing that really matters is flow is not a binary. It's not I'm in the zone or I'm out [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6045.92s)]
*  of the zone. It's actually a four-stage cycle, so you don't get to live in a permanent flow state [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6051.5199999999995s)]
*  because it doesn't work that way in the brain. It's a cycle and some of the stages are very [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6055.44s)]
*  un-flowy, but you have to move through the complete cycle. I teach people this cycle [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6060.24s)]
*  because that's the map of the territory. Oh, this is where I am. This is where I have to go next. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6064.24s)]
*  This is where I have to go next. Do you actually think about that? Oh, yeah. You think about this [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6068.08s)]
*  is where I am and this is where I have to go next. Oh, yeah. All the time. Well, I also, so [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6072.639999999999s)]
*  flow is followed or let me do it quickly. On the front end of a flow state is a struggle phase. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6076.8s)]
*  Flow is unconscious, right? It's what happens when you've loaded your brain up with a bunch of [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6083.12s)]
*  information and can put it together in a new way and put it all together. You have to still [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6086.96s)]
*  onboard that stuff consciously, right? That's the struggle phase. It's like throwing shit on a [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6095.76s)]
*  piece of paper. Right. Struggle is always followed by a release phase. You have to take your mind [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6100.16s)]
*  out of the problem because you've been loading the conscious brain. You've overloaded it and it turns [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6104.72s)]
*  out in struggle and this is work that came out of the University of Michigan, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6109.52s)]
*  um, Carlene Seifert's lab, really great work. She found that the more frustrated you get, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6114.08s)]
*  like when you're overloading your brain, the more frustrated you get, the closer you are to actual, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6120.400000000001s)]
*  uh, real solution and flow. So frustration is actually really good in that situation. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6124.8s)]
*  You know, it feels really bad, but it needs to be followed by a release activity. A release activity [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6129.360000000001s)]
*  is a low grade physical activity works best to take your mind out of the problem. And when I say [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6134.72s)]
*  low grade, I don't mean go get a hard workout. I'll walk in nature drawing, right? Um, works [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6139.76s)]
*  really, really well. So the way my schedule is I wake up at four, I start writing and I write [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6145.52s)]
*  seven 38. Um, if you and I talk, we use it in the morning is I'll write from four AM to seven 38 [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6151.04s)]
*  o'clock. And the minute I'm done writing, I take my dog for a hike. Why? Because I've, if I'm in [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6158.72s)]
*  struggle, I want to follow up by release. If I was in flow while I was writing on the back end [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6166.56s)]
*  of a flow state flows, a high energy state, it's got a built in recovery period. So you have to [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6170.88s)]
*  recover on the back end. So if I was in flow while I was writing, great, a walk in nature is a [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6176.56s)]
*  phenomenal recovery activity. It's also phenomenal recently activity. So a lot of, I always say that [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6180.400000000001s)]
*  like ultimately in the end with flow stuff, especially with like top performers, first of [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6185.68s)]
*  all, flow is how everybody performs at their best. It's like, this is how humans are hardwired. This [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6189.6s)]
*  is what optimal performance looks like. So most people, if you're in the top 20% of your field, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6194.16s)]
*  top 30% of you've been good, you're good at this anyways. I'm not going to come in and totally [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6199.28s)]
*  reboot your life. What I, with my goal is if I do my job right, I'm going to find two or three [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6204.4s)]
*  things that you should start doing two or three things you should stop doing. And then two or [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6210.72s)]
*  three things that I want to rearrange your schedule. So you'll do, you're doing the right thing, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6215.12s)]
*  but probably at the wrong time for your neurobiology. This is what's so great about [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6218.96s)]
*  what we've learned over the past 20 years is this is what's an art of impossible is we have a [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6224.08s)]
*  complete map of cognitive peak performance in the brain. Now we know what it is. We know the order [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6228.72s)]
*  of the sequence. We like it. The data is getting really, really robust for training these things. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6233.6s)]
*  I want to just mention something that you taught me years ago, which I want to pass along to [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6238.72s)]
*  everybody listening, which is the greatest writers in the world complete a single finished page per [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6244.88s)]
*  day. About a page a day. I've thought about that a thousand times. It was the unlocking. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6252.88s)]
*  Let me tell you the story. The story is amazing. So I was in grad school at Hopkins and I got to [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6262.08s)]
*  study under Stephen Dixon. He's a name a lot of people don't know, but he, he very distinguished [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6266.56s)]
*  writer, won the national book award has done a lot of stuff. But at the time, I don't know if it's [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6272.32s)]
*  still true, but at the time he was the most published fiction author in history. And Chekhov [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6276.799999999999s)]
*  had the record before him had like 250 things. Stephen had published 650 short stories, novels, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6283.12s)]
*  books, like it was the massive productivity. On top of that, he taught at Hopkins. So he wasn't, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6291.36s)]
*  right. Wasn't writing a full time. He was teaching and he had a very, very, very sick wife. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6297.04s)]
*  She was in a wheelchair. She needed a tremendous amount of care. And I remember thinking like, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6302.32s)]
*  how the hell did this guy, like he's got a full time job and he's got a really sick wife and he's [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6308.0s)]
*  not rich. So he's not, it doesn't have full time care. He's doing the work. How the hell is he so [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6314.48s)]
*  productive? And I asked him, he said, it's really simple. I write a page a day and I edit what I [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6319.2s)]
*  wrote the day before. And if you do that 365 days a year, you've written a book. And I was like, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6324.24s)]
*  oh, okay. And so from that point on, I write, I mean, I write 500, when I'm starting a book, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6330.400000000001s)]
*  it's 500 words a day, which is about a little more over a page. I'll bump it up to like seven or [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6337.92s)]
*  800 words in the middle, cause it's easier and you know more what you're doing at the end of the [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6343.360000000001s)]
*  book. It's about a thousand words a day. But like I published 16 books. Probably, I mean, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6346.72s)]
*  this was a bunch of years ago, but they tried to add up something like 5 million published words. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6355.6s)]
*  And there's an equal amount of unpublished words. And it's that formula. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6363.76s)]
*  And I love that. And I think about that. So when I wake up in the morning, [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6370.24s)]
*  where my mind is the clearest and I've got the most energy, the first thing I do when I wake up, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6374.64s)]
*  and I typically wake up before my alarm, is I do a gratitude practice. It's like, thank you for the [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6379.92s)]
*  amazing day ahead, what I can do in this world. And then I focus on what am I excited about today? [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6387.28s)]
*  What's the big thing? And this morning it was like spending this time with you and having an [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6395.4400000000005s)]
*  awesome conversation and sharing your wisdom with the world. And it's those golden hours in the [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6399.6s)]
*  earliest. And it's... Well, the other thing, there's another thing. Let me ask you this question. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6407.92s)]
*  Do you find when we're working on a book and you're waking up and you're writing and you're [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6411.679999999999s)]
*  focused on that, are you happier throughout the day than if you're not? Probably, because I feel [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6416.5599999999995s)]
*  like I've made a significant... I'm a accomplishment junkie. And so when I feel like I've won the day [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6423.04s)]
*  in the first two hours... Exactly. One. But the other thing I think is also that's equally [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6435.04s)]
*  important that people don't realize, I like to go from bed to desk in under five minutes. And the [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6439.04s)]
*  reason is when you wake up... So flow, if we're talking about networks, brain waves, flow takes [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6446.0s)]
*  place on the border between alpha and theta. Alpha is daydreaming mode, theta is REM sleep or focus. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6452.24s)]
*  And it's on the alpha theta borderline. By the way, that aha moment, so that's always takes place [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6458.48s)]
*  inside a gamma wave. Gamma is coupled to theta. So if the brain can't get to theta, you can't have [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6467.44s)]
*  an aha insight. So one of the reasons you have more aha insights and flow is because it perches [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6475.04s)]
*  you on the edge. In that theta state, you're on the edge of aha insight. You're ready to have a [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6480.08s)]
*  breakthrough. But the alpha theta borderline, you wake up in alpha. Your brain wakes up in alpha. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6485.92s)]
*  So as soon as it gets awake alert excited, that's high beta. It's hard to move back down to theta. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6496.56s)]
*  It's a much slower wave. But if you go like bed to desk and immediately drop into flow, [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6503.76s)]
*  focus your attention and start working on something and get sucked in, it's easier to drop into flow [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6509.04s)]
*  that way. And I find it's not just that I'm I used to think it was just the goal stuff. Like I'm very [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6513.76s)]
*  goal oriented. And if I win my day, that's huge. But it's also if I tame my brain right out the gate [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6519.12s)]
*  teach it to focus and don't let it run wild. Whip that brain. Yeah, no, I mean, to me, it's like to [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6526.96s)]
*  me, it's the two together. And if I can be a little creative in the writing, like that's the recipe. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6532.4800000000005s)]
*  Perfect. Amazing. Amazing. You have done an amazing job. I'll call it your moonshot of putting flow [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6539.919999999999s)]
*  on the world's conversation. I will say we have we are now writing the textbook myself, my chief [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6546.799999999999s)]
*  science officer and other neuroscientists for the field of applied performance neuroscience, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6555.839999999999s)]
*  which is essentially the field that you know, me and a couple of other people, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6561.04s)]
*  there was no conversations around this. None of this. It didn't exist. So to me, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6564.719999999999s)]
*  like the moonshot, I always said my goal was to put flow science on a hard [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6568.48s)]
*  both our flow research and a hard science footing, like I wanted to bring it into the [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6573.839999999999s)]
*  realm of neurobiology and make it really, really real. I didn't actually realize I was going to [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6577.44s)]
*  end up inventing a field. Right? Like that was that was a weird one. But it wasn't just me, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6583.759999999999s)]
*  it was a bunch of us who were thinking about altered states of consciousness as tools for [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6589.5199999999995s)]
*  performance. And, you know, it got the way I want to go back to the psychophys paper, [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6594.48s)]
*  because here's a weird one for mindset. But this is also a field. So the psychophys paper released [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6599.679999999999s)]
*  today? No, this is a year ago. But this is just a great example of applied performance neuroscience, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6604.639999999999s)]
*  and the weird stuff we're discovering. So we were looking we weren't it wasn't a flow flow. So it [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6611.5199999999995s)]
*  was a mindset study. And we wanted to know people who love exercise. What does it look like in their [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6615.839999999999s)]
*  brain versus people who hate exercise? And right. And we discovered that people who love exercise [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6624.16s)]
*  literally process exercise and all the information in a totally different part of the brain than [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6631.28s)]
*  people who don't like exercise. And I shifted myself. Well, that's what that was the point I [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6636.4s)]
*  was trying to make is it turns out it works like a mindset, and you can shift it. And so we looked [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6641.84s)]
*  at that. I linked exercise to longevity. And that's what shifted for you. I mean, you were [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6648.16s)]
*  always but I mean, I remember back, well, at least in like 2007, 2008, like I remember coming to LA [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6653.92s)]
*  and going for runs with you on the beach. But but this is different. Now you're told now you love [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6661.84s)]
*  it and you're into it. You know, five days a week in the gym with weights. And it's part of who I [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6666.32s)]
*  you know, you establish this is who I am. And I'm this because I'm going to I'm going to win that [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6673.04s)]
*  that arm wrestle. We're going to continue that for the rest of our lives. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6680.0s)]
*  But this is who I am. And my longevity mindset fuels that desire for exercise. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6684.24s)]
*  You know, I will say the longevity mindset. You've done such a spectacular job with it. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6691.12s)]
*  I just remember I was I think it was at a Joe Polish event. I think I was at his 100k [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6697.12s)]
*  last 100k event and Dan Sullivan was there and he was talking about living I think his number is [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6701.4400000000005s)]
*  154. 154. 154. Right. Is that right? Is that right? And I was like, this is Peter. This is Peter [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6707.2s)]
*  rotting Dan's brain. No, but it's really the longevity mindset. I'm interested to see if there's [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6715.280000000001s)]
*  actual neurobiology underneath it. Like I'd be curious to like, is it does it work as a frame or [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6724.88s)]
*  is it actually producing like information processing? But let's talk about your next [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6730.88s)]
*  project. The Alliance. The Alliance. Yeah, I want to hear about it. So what is it? What is it offering? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6736.64s)]
*  Why are you excited about it? So high level, let me just start at the beginning, because you asked [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6744.24s)]
*  me this question earlier, I didn't answer it. We train, you know, kazoos of people at this point. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6748.64s)]
*  Top tech companies around. Yeah, I mean, like just Meta, Accenture, Audi, Google, Bain Capital, [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6753.76s)]
*  you know, on and on. And tens of thousands of people at those events. Yeah. Yeah. And [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6762.32s)]
*  one of the things, but predominantly knowledge workers, right? Like if you're at any of those [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6771.2s)]
*  companies, high performing knowledge workers. And then I have another class that this is sort of like [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6774.56s)]
*  just a passion class where I've done flow for writers once a year for 10 years. I train up [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6781.28s)]
*  writers how to use flow to write better. And I took the private version. You took the private [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6785.5199999999995s)]
*  version, right? And what I started to notice and it was more accidental is if we got super creatives [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6789.759999999999s)]
*  in Zero to Dangerous, didn't quite work as well. It worked, but it wasn't like the explosions we [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6797.28s)]
*  would get for normal people. And if I had knowledge workers and flow for writers, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6805.36s)]
*  it didn't work as well. And it was like, it started me thinking about this is the stuff [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6810.0s)]
*  we were talking about, how the creative brain is different. How you train peak performance [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6814.48s)]
*  in creatives versus non-creatives is actually almost exactly backwards. So that was the first [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6819.92s)]
*  insight is, whoa, how you train creatives is different. The second insight was, I think of [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6826.8s)]
*  myself first and foremost as a creative and most of the people I know in the world, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6834.32s)]
*  you could be a creative entrepreneur, you could be creative scientist, creative technologist, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6840.5599999999995s)]
*  creative innovator, creative artist, whatever, but they're all in this category. And I started to [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6843.679999999999s)]
*  realize that both myself and every friend I had, almost every conversation, it was the same [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6848.24s)]
*  conversations. We were all facing overlapping, like five overlapping challenges. And I was [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6855.44s)]
*  incredibly well suited to help people with some of them. So one, there was just, [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6862.08s)]
*  one of the biggest differences between professional, between creatives and other [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6866.32s)]
*  people and knowledge workers is, and this is really important, in for knowledge workers, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6869.5199999999995s)]
*  flow is essentially a luxury. It's great to have. You will be way more productive. You will have way [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6874.96s)]
*  more meaning. Your life will be more fulfilling, happier, less illness, et cetera, et cetera. But [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6880.88s)]
*  you're not going to get fired if you can't get into flow. You won't lose your job. For people who [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6885.44s)]
*  are top creatives, if you're a creative entrepreneur and you're running a company, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6890.96s)]
*  if you're an artist writing a book or any of that stuff, if you can't get into flow, you can't do [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6896.24s)]
*  your job at all, period. Like it's not so full stop. And I, and I was, that was interesting to me. So [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6900.16s)]
*  like being able to train the Alliance, let me back up and tell you what it is. It's an eight month, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6907.44s)]
*  it's a combination of like a 21st century think tank and a mastermind for the super creative core. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6913.92s)]
*  So this is an eight month program that you put people through. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6920.72s)]
*  People through, we're just starting out. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6923.200000000001s)]
*  All digitally on Zoom? [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6925.200000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no. This is the, so this is the exact opposite. It's not, I'm not even doing it inside [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6926.160000000001s)]
*  the Flow Research Collective because it's literally the exact opposite of everything the Flow Research [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6931.04s)]
*  Collective was created to do. It's, which was high ticket digital trainings, blah, blah, blah, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6935.6s)]
*  for predominantly knowledge workers. This is, and live events. So people have been wanting to [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6941.360000000001s)]
*  more time hanging out with me for years. I've heard this and I'm an introvert and like, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6948.72s)]
*  I have to do it with super creatives because- [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6952.96s)]
*  I mean, this is, this is rare for us, unfortunately. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6954.72s)]
*  It is rare. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6957.04s)]
*  We're on the phone every morning. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6957.6s)]
*  It's hard to get me into the world. So it is. So no, there's three live events. You kick off with [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6960.0s)]
*  a two day live, there's a two day live training in the middle and there's a close. And then there's [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6966.24s)]
*  six, six week training cycles. And I kick each one off with like a two hour content window. And then- [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6971.92s)]
*  That's over Zoom? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6979.5199999999995s)]
*  That's over Zoom. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6980.639999999999s)]
*  Now, what's the size of the group here? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6981.599999999999s)]
*  A hundred people. It's specific for a reason. One, so there's a certain amount of cross training [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6983.44s)]
*  and cross pollination of ideas. That's amazing. The second reason, I mean, I always say, [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6992.639999999999s)]
*  you know, you want that cross pollination with creatives. I always, the example I always give [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=6997.76s)]
*  to people is actually you, which is, you know, we've gone back so far that like, [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7001.52s)]
*  my friend Peter helped unlock the space frontier, right? Like it was a crazy fricking idea. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7008.0s)]
*  And then it was a breakthrough, right? The same thing we're always talking about the day before. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7013.28s)]
*  So things are- [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7016.400000000001s)]
*  Truly a breakthrough to crazy. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7017.2s)]
*  It's a crazy idea. And you had a legit, true crazy idea. It was like a lot of the action [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7018.320000000001s)]
*  sport athletes I knew back in the nineties also who were doing impossible things. And I had [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7023.04s)]
*  friends, my friends were actually people who were pulling off the impossible. And the truth of the [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7028.24s)]
*  matter is like, by the time the X prize was won, because the right once it was won eight years [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7032.48s)]
*  later and the writing was on the wall that this was the like private space was real. This was [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7038.16s)]
*  going to happen. Jeff had already found a blue origin was right. Blue origin was there. Richard [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7042.56s)]
*  was, and you were like, this is real. And so my level of what I think is possible in the world [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7048.5599999999995s)]
*  is absurd because my friend Peter helped unlock the space frontier and my other friends, the [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7057.2s)]
*  athletes literally redefined what was possible for human species. So I came into the world with this [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7061.44s)]
*  really warped like expectation for what I could do in the world. Because my friends work the same way [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7067.04s)]
*  that to me is, it's the, it's, that's a cross pollination. That's not really ideas. It's a [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7074.0s)]
*  cross pollination of like aspirations and what you can't really get that, but a hundred people, [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7078.96s)]
*  I want, I've been involved, helped birth five or six major subcultures. I was in Seattle, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7085.28s)]
*  the birth of the grunge movement. I was in San Francisco at the birth of the internet. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7091.84s)]
*  I was in Cleveland and Chicago and Illinois at the birth of like industrial music. When that whole [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7095.5199999999995s)]
*  movement started up a bunch of these in Santa Fe at the beginning of the new age, [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7100.08s)]
*  instead of these huge culture shifting communities, but at the center, it's like a hundred people [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7104.24s)]
*  across the board. Every time I've been in one of these things, it's about a hundred people. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7110.72s)]
*  It's a really important point. It's not giant. It's not even if you're looking at something [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7114.0s)]
*  like the internet, which sounds absurd. Or crypto currency or Bitcoin, right? All of these things [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7120.48s)]
*  started with a very small group of radical thinkers who gravitated together. And yeah. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7124.88s)]
*  Yeah. No, and I mean, you know, I call them the benign conspiracies. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7131.12s)]
*  It is exactly how I think about it. It's exactly that's exactly right. But so I started to realize [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7134.8s)]
*  there was in looking at all these subcultures that I was involved in the birth of, I was like, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7138.72s)]
*  you know, it's always about a hundred people. So, right. That was, that was one thing I didn't want [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7143.12s)]
*  to go too big because I wanted it to be intimate, but I didn't want it to go too small because I [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7148.8s)]
*  wanted that vibrancy and that cross-pollination of ideas. And I also wanted, you know this, like, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7154.08s)]
*  people think about like the lone creative inventor. I don't, it doesn't work that way. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7160.16s)]
*  Creativity is a cooperative sport. Even if you're a totally like the, I write books, there's nothing [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7165.04s)]
*  more, I'm going to do this alone, but I don't do it alone. I've got an editor I work with twice a [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7171.2s)]
*  week. I've got a bunch of people at the publishing house I'm going to end up working with. Then [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7176.16s)]
*  there's going to be the marketing team and the PR team and the social media team. These are [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7179.36s)]
*  collective collaborative efforts and you need a bunch of people involved. All creative projects [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7183.44s)]
*  are like that. So what I wanted to do is I wanted to really lift up the super creative core. So I [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7189.12s)]
*  have a bunch of these challenges, train them up and flow. I'll talk about some of the other human [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7193.839999999999s)]
*  stuff, but the hundred people was for the cross-pollination of ideas and to get enough people [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7197.04s)]
*  in sort of every category that there was always going to be one or two bodies in every category. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7202.4s)]
*  Give me some category examples. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7208.88s)]
*  Well, let's just talk about faculty, for example. My faculty at this point stretches from [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7212.0s)]
*  Jody Levy, who's the head of Summit. She is a great experienced designer. Ivy Ross, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7219.28s)]
*  who's the head of design at Google. She's a hard goods designer and a tech designer, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7224.96s)]
*  all the way to Scott Barry Coppin, who's the world's leading expert on creativity [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7230.4s)]
*  and transpersonal psychology. So there you've got three different disciplines. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7235.12s)]
*  We've got musicians, AI people, filmmakers, writers, tons of different entrepreneurs and [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7243.599999999999s)]
*  tech entrepreneurs and 17, 20 different disciplines and things like that. But the thing I really want [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7250.5599999999995s)]
*  to talk about, because this is the one that creatives get immediately, is I started to realize [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7255.679999999999s)]
*  everybody I knew, creativity is so lonely. It's fucking lonely. You're a weirdo to begin with, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7261.92s)]
*  so you came up weird. You took whatever made you weird and you turned it into your profession. You [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7269.200000000001s)]
*  just honed it. But I always say that another word for world's leading expert is nobody around to [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7273.84s)]
*  talk to about the stuff you care about the most. Think about early days of space and when you [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7283.04s)]
*  and I were first meeting to talk about the experts, fuck you take that conversation almost any place [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7291.76s)]
*  and they're just laughing at you. You can't have a conversation. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7297.280000000001s)]
*  This is only NASA can do it. Yes. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7299.68s)]
*  So I started to realize, and the other thing about creatives, every creative I know, it's not just [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7301.200000000001s)]
*  that the jobs are isolating because they are, you spend a lot of time alone, but you're very [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7305.84s)]
*  isolated in your head. You could be in a room filled with people, but if you're a super creative [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7311.76s)]
*  core, you could be totally lost in your thoughts and walled off from everybody. And everybody, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7316.8s)]
*  I knew, literally everybody I knew, this level of deep loneliness was in everything. And [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7321.68s)]
*  loneliness impacts creativity. It impacts intelligence. It's not great. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7330.56s)]
*  So it sounds like the Alliance is an incubator. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7336.0s)]
*  It's among, we haven't been around long. Or a studio of some type. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7338.96s)]
*  I mean, I think it's going to be a combination of a writer's studio, an artist studio, an incubator, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7344.64s)]
*  I think all those things, it's training creatives up in flow and training them up in the neurobiology [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7349.44s)]
*  of creativity. A lot of the stuff we're talking about, like these are tools. You can use them. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7355.6s)]
*  I'm training them up in AI for all the reasons we've been talking about. I want to solve the [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7359.84s)]
*  loneliness problem. I also want to give people a space to come finish a masterpiece. So this is the [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7364.8s)]
*  thing that hangs up so many creatives. It could be, this is the dream company I want to start. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7369.76s)]
*  This is the book I want to finish. This is the movie I want to make, whatever. Everybody's got [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7375.52s)]
*  that thing. And you and I, we're both so goal oriented. You know, when you have an unfinished [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7379.360000000001s)]
*  masterpiece hanging over you, it's like an albatross. It is. It's also your guilty pleasure [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7384.88s)]
*  and you're trying to steal time to do it. And having a community that keeps you accountable [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7390.72s)]
*  right? So critical. Not only keeps you accountable, because I think creatives get derailed at a couple [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7397.52s)]
*  of places. It's both that keeps you accountable. This is the hundred people, because there's also, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7404.56s)]
*  I always tell this to writers, and you know this, writing the book, you're only halfway through [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7410.64s)]
*  the process of actually putting that book into the world. And you've just spent five years and you [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7416.88s)]
*  think you've just written, like run the marathon. And then you get to this point, you're like, oh shit, [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7422.4s)]
*  it's a triathlon. I've got two more of these. Because then you've got the editing, which is going [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7428.5599999999995s)]
*  to be, you finish the book, now you've got a year long editing. It's the polishing. And then you've [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7433.36s)]
*  got the launch. And what happens with creatives is- And by the way, if you're interested in writing [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7438.0s)]
*  a book, one of the things to realize is your publisher does almost nothing for you. Nothing. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7443.759999999999s)]
*  Nothing. Yeah. They don't. The reason I have a personal editor is because immediate feedback [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7448.56s)]
*  is a flow trigger. And so I always tell companies, if you're running your company with quarterly [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7454.400000000001s)]
*  reviews or annual reviews, you're a moron. Because you're driving your employees out of flow. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7460.56s)]
*  I realized with writing, my publisher, when I had the best editors I've ever had at publishing houses, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7466.56s)]
*  and they don't often exist that much anymore. I've got a couple of good ones now. But [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7472.72s)]
*  if they read one of my books three times along the way, that's huge. If I can get three readings [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7476.24s)]
*  of a book, that's huge. I need feedback almost daily. Definitely a couple of times a week. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7484.88s)]
*  ChatGBT makes it a little bit easier because while I don't like it to write my copy, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7492.96s)]
*  it really says nice things about my copy. Like, hey, how's this version? Oh, this version is [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7497.92s)]
*  excellent. It's strong for this reason. I do that all the time. I do that all the time. I use it to [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7503.36s)]
*  give you feedback. Why do you like it so much? It's an ego boost. So no, what I was going to say is, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7508.16s)]
*  I wanted to, first of all, train up their brains and everything else. So the actual creative portion [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7514.719999999999s)]
*  of it was solid. But I also noticed that how many people have you seen who have like, they finished [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7520.799999999999s)]
*  a book, but they can't get through the editing or they've got through the editing, but they have no [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7526.4s)]
*  clue how do you publish it? How do you promote it? How do you build a marketing campaign? So I was [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7530.96s)]
*  like, if I can get enough bodies in there, there are a couple of people in every seat around that [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7535.68s)]
*  process. You're not going to get as derailed. So when's the first Alliance? We're going to launch [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7541.6s)]
*  in June. I think you're going to break the news to the world because we haven't even told... [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7546.56s)]
*  But you've started bringing people in. We have started bringing people in. We're building it. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7554.4800000000005s)]
*  It's... I'm so excited. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7558.48s)]
*  When you told me about it first, I was like, wow. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7562.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. I mean, it was funny. I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday who's... [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7563.92s)]
*  He's one of those guys with a B in front of his name, right? For billions. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7571.2s)]
*  One of those guys. I was talking to him yesterday about it and... [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7575.84s)]
*  It was a B in front of his bank account. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7580.32s)]
*  Yeah, a B in front of his bank account. And he was like, are you kidding? You're going... [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7581.6s)]
*  What happens usually when I talk about to creatives, it's the funniest thing in the world. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7585.84s)]
*  I say, oh, I'm going to train you up and flow. First of all, then they light up. And then I [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7591.04s)]
*  usually just talk about loneliness and everybody's done. They're like, I'm in. Sign me up. He was [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7596.8s)]
*  like, are you freaking kidding? He's like, I probably lose $5 million a year to loneliness. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7603.04s)]
*  To the days that I lose, because I'm not at my best because I'm dealing with just emotional stuff. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7608.4s)]
*  He's like, if I average it out, he obviously makes a lot of money. So he's dealing in bigger [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7613.92s)]
*  sums than maybe most other people. But I was like, Jesus Christ, forget about this thing paying for [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7618.88s)]
*  itself. And he's like, that's only one of your features. I was like, yeah, I sort of think about [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7624.8s)]
*  it that myself. Let me put it in a different context. This is definitely true of artists. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7628.88s)]
*  I don't know if it's as true about entrepreneurs, but I think it is because freaking every book I [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7634.16s)]
*  write about entrepreneurship talks about the emotional upheaval of entrepreneurship. And it's [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7639.76s)]
*  funny, I just read Secrets of Sandhill Road, which is old, right? Like that was early thousands, [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7644.320000000001s)]
*  I want to say. And it's got a whole chapter on the insanity and the emotional upheaval and the [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7649.360000000001s)]
*  loneliness of entrepreneurship. And I was like, this is at least 25 years old, but I talk about [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7654.0s)]
*  it with creatives and they're so instantly like, oh my God, we're going to solve that. Oh, please. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7659.12s)]
*  Do people come in on their own or do they bring a team with them? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7664.8s)]
*  Depends. We've seen both. We've also seen some of the bigger organizations are using this like an [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7667.5199999999995s)]
*  education program for their staff. So they're like, okay, I've got, because you know, $30,000, [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7674.719999999999s)]
*  it's a lot of, but if you don't control your upper income and you can't like, yes, I know, [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7680.5599999999995s)]
*  if I train you up in creativity, you're going to make at least 13% more. And I know we like, we know [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7685.839999999999s)]
*  that from that kind of stuff, but what if you can't affect that? So big companies are coming in [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7690.639999999999s)]
*  saying, dude, I got art directors, I got designers, and I've got even publicist and things like that [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7695.36s)]
*  where they're writing in there, whatever. And my scientists, and so they're actually coming in [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7700.88s)]
*  and saying, oh no, we've got a budget and we're going to call this continuing education. And we're [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7704.719999999999s)]
*  going to send like six of our top team people. Makes a ton of sense. I mean, you're training up [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7708.32s)]
*  your most critical asset. In like in creativity, which is the skill that at least for the next 10 [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7715.04s)]
*  to 15 years until the AI is get, and we don't know, but I'm more optimistic than you are. By the way, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7721.04s)]
*  this is the first time in history where I am more optimistic than Peter. I'm usually the cynical [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7726.8s)]
*  bastard who has to ground our books in reality because Peter's the wild-eyed boy from Free Cloud. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7731.76s)]
*  Well, I'm optimistic about AI crushing our creativity. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7737.28s)]
*  So where do people- I just wanted to take my sell and sell it on the open market. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7744.56s)]
*  Well, there'd be buyers, there'd be buyers. Let's not go there. So where do people go and [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7749.52s)]

*  you ready for a reading with Steven? And that's one of my favorite moments. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7798.56s)]
*  I get to just say this out loud, because one of the things that I think is really amazing is, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7803.4400000000005s)]
*  I think this happened to both of us a couple of years ago where we woke up and we were like, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7808.96s)]
*  holy shit, we've been friends for almost three decades. This is really, really, really special. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7812.8s)]
*  And like, carrot watering. It's like, we've gotten very tender with how we treat each other. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7818.320000000001s)]
*  When we first came together, it was just like the war of ideas over every sentence. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7824.160000000001s)]
*  I've had to talk you into books. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7830.0s)]
*  Yes, you have. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7832.08s)]
*  Our first book, Abundance, I tried to write a book with you about space first, [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7833.4400000000005s)]
*  which was a failed attempt. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7837.76s)]
*  Failed attempt. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7839.6s)]
*  But Abundance, I mean, you didn't have to talk me into Abundance because I was looking at the [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7842.08s)]
*  environmental side of it. I was worried it was going to be too ungrounded. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7845.280000000001s)]
*  You were like, I have other things I'm working. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7852.64s)]
*  Well, no, I was... [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7855.360000000001s)]
*  I had to disrupt your cart. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7855.92s)]
*  I was working on a Richard Granger who's in Dartmouth. He's a neuroscientist. We were going [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7858.4800000000005s)]
*  to curate a book. I'm really glad we didn't. I wasn't smart enough yet. I hadn't educated [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7863.84s)]
*  myself enough. I would have gotten my ass kicked. There were like three other projects. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7871.84s)]
*  You came in and I know you were the lowest-ranking one in the beginning. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7876.400000000001s)]
*  You rapidly climbed up there. But it was really like when you presented the ideas to me, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7881.4400000000005s)]
*  because I had been looking... You were really sweeping. I mean, obviously, I'd been a tech [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7886.88s)]
*  science writer for 20 years at that point. So it wasn't I was ignorant about it. But I care about [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7892.88s)]
*  plants, animals, and ecosystems. So I was like, how do we apply technology to plants, animals, [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7898.0s)]
*  and ecosystems? How do we use technology to save plants, animals, and ecosystems? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7904.64s)]
*  And you were really, especially Dan, really focused on the X Prize, using technology to help [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7908.96s)]
*  humanity. So I thought when you came in, I was like, holy crap, we each got half of the puzzle. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7916.24s)]
*  And you had the good overarching tech framework. I had a little bit of the science and the [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7924.48s)]
*  psychology and the cognitive, but all that stuff. It was an incredibly fortuitous partnership, [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7928.48s)]
*  because each of us had two, each of us had components of this that we absolutely had to [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7934.64s)]
*  bring together. And then it took me about a year to get you on board with our latest book. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7939.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, longer. I think you've been working on it for two to three years on this one. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7944.56s)]
*  Are you happy we were doing it? I'm so happy. This book is so fun. As I said, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7949.6s)]
*  yet not only... Well, one, because you have to understand though, it's still mine. I mean, [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7954.64s)]
*  the new book, just so people know, in abundance, we made the argument that, hey, exponential [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7961.2s)]
*  technology gives us the chance to raise global standards of living for every man, woman, child, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7967.12s)]
*  or planet. And man, there were their naysayers, right? Like that was the hardest argument to make [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7971.599999999999s)]
*  out loud. And even, I mean, Christ, you opened TED and that guy who followed you, right? They [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7977.5199999999995s)]
*  could even put you on the stage at TED and let you talk. They had to have a counter argument [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7986.639999999999s)]
*  immediately afterwards, right? And now it's 15 years later. The most astounding thing to me is [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=7992.32s)]
*  how the amount of, when you talk about basic standards of living going up and up. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=8001.68s)]
*  Yeah. It's been insane. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=8008.5599999999995s)]
*  The data is sort of astounding. It's shocking. And nobody realized it. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=8010.16s)]
*  Nobody realized it. We are the frog boiling in the proverbial water. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=8015.44s)]
*  It's the craziest thing. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=8019.36s)]
*  By the way, just so folks know, this is a book that will come out in 2026. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=8021.36s)]
*  2026? Probably at abundance 360. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=8026.0s)]
*  Yeah, March 2026. And so don't go looking for it right now. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhB_ZX2XGf0&t=8028.4s)]
