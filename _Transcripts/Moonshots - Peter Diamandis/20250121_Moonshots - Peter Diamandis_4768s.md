# The New Administration Means Major Change for Crypto, AI & Tech w/ Salim Ismail | EP #143
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM)
*  Hey buddy, before we jump into the tech stuff that happened this past week, I have a question for you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=0.0s)]
*  What are your top five predictions, hopes, whatever you want for the new White House administration? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=5.12s)]
*  Fine, that's a lot. Can I give you three? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=12.96s)]
*  You can give me three. I mean, if you're really smart, you'd give me five. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=18.8s)]
*  I'm not that smart. Okay, so number one would be, I think there's the opportunity, the Chinese [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=22.88s)]
*  economy is in a bit of a mess and yet they want Taiwan. I think he strikes a grand bargain to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=28.72s)]
*  allow trade and balance the trade better and give them Taiwan over a period of time and navigate [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=34.8s)]
*  that tension and have it dissolved by creating a master deal. I think he does the same in Russia [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=44.4s)]
*  and Ukraine. And so I think there's an opportunity and my prediction is that they use their [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=49.36s)]
*  saber rattling capability to change these political conflicts because it'll put them in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  history books as a changing the global order. So that's number one. Number two would be- [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=61.28s)]
*  So he's playing a giant game of risk, like the board game where you're jibbing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=67.52s)]
*  That's right, right? And what's the oldest one? Never do a land war in Asia. If you ever play [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  risk, you said- That's true. That's the last place you go. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=75.92s)]
*  You never do a land war. So like cut a deal. The second one would be the opportunity for crypto [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=79.28s)]
*  to change the game in a bunch of areas. I would love, I think I would love to predict he will [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=86.56s)]
*  allow crypto to the level of having a UBI type scheme for crypto that could benefit the entire [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=91.44s)]
*  population and be a beacon to the rest of the world as to where this goes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=96.8s)]
*  Universal basic income. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=100.16s)]
*  Yeah, and the trick is how do you give people enough money to survive but not be happy? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=101.84s)]
*  Because then it really works. Otherwise you end up with socialism and the whole thing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=105.36s)]
*  collapses if you give people too much money. My third one is that given the disaster in LA and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=108.48s)]
*  the need to rebuild that the Trump administration comes up with a housing code hat that allows [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=113.76s)]
*  people to build temporary structures on their properties so that they can live on their own [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=119.84s)]
*  property while they rebuild a main house or a neighbor's house they can live in and an ability [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=124.0s)]
*  to have a temporary housing code that lasts like a year or two that you can at least get something [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=129.04s)]
*  up and going very very quickly and that would completely change the game for for LA and also [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=135.2s)]
*  what's happening in North Carolina and the next ones to follow. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  All right, I'm gonna give you five because that's what I asked for originally. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=143.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  You can still come back with with a few more. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=149.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=150.72s)]
*  So I think Trump is going to do stuff which is great for America and great for him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  So I think... [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=159.28s)]
*  Not in that order. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=160.16s)]
*  So being the president that put humans back on the moon that's easy. We're going to see [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=161.28s)]
*  humanity on the moon in a couple years. I do think he's going to make a massive push [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=168.56s)]
*  given the fact that Elon's in the White House too to put humans on Mars. You know boots on Mars. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=173.52s)]
*  I said they're going to be... [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=178.8s)]
*  I like it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  You know optimist robots on Mars but I think we're going to see a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=180.08s)]
*  massive increase in the space program as part of this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=183.52s)]
*  The second thing I think we're going to see is a huge deregulation in the biotech industry. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=187.84s)]
*  Biotech has been one of the most regulated industries. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=196.48s)]
*  It crushed the biotech financial markets over the last four years. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=200.32s)]
*  And you know a lot of folks I know need to leave the U.S. to go get experimental treatments [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=207.28s)]
*  or get stem cells. I think we're going to change that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=214.16s)]
*  At the same time that we're deregulating biotech I think we're going to massively [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=217.68s)]
*  re-regulate foods. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=223.2s)]
*  So I think with Bobby Kennedy and head of Health and Human Services [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=225.04s)]
*  I love it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=230.4s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=231.12s)]
*  I think we're going to stop the insanity which is our food system right now. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=231.84s)]
*  At least I hope we do. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=237.52s)]
*  Here's a chance to finally do what's right for our health. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  I looked at the numbers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=245.36s)]
*  We're something like 74th in the world in life expectancy and 73rd in health span expectancy [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=247.44s)]
*  and number one in expenditures on food. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=258.32s)]
*  This is a result... [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=262.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, number one on expenditures on health. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=263.92s)]
*  70% of the population is overweight or obese. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=266.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=269.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's not because we just got hungry all of a sudden. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  It's because the food, the bullshit that we're feeding our kids and ourselves. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=273.12s)]
*  So I think we're going to regulate foods and change this dramatically. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  Make America healthy again. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that's going to be the mantra. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  I think we're going to do that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=285.68s)]
*  The next thing I think was we're going to see a massive push for energy independence. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=288.0s)]
*  We'll talk about this later, but I think we'll see the White House basically open the floodgates, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=294.48s)]
*  reducing regulation and red tape enabling hopefully mostly solar and fission plants. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=301.04s)]
*  I think we're going to have unfortunately a fair share of coal plants as well, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=310.16s)]
*  but we need to double the energy productivity of this country for sure. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=314.88s)]
*  So energy at all costs, I think is going to be one of the hallmarks of this White House. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=319.68s)]
*  I hope given SACS and the AI tech bro posse in there, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  we're going to use AI to evaluate all the policies that we're running. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  And how do we make regulation more efficient? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=341.68s)]
*  We'll talk about this a little bit later in the episode as well. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=345.68s)]
*  Right now, whatever industry you're in, you've got 5,000 regulations you've got to go through, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=348.56s)]
*  enough lawyers and paperwork. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  There's got to be some way for AI to make it simplified and still safe. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=358.56s)]
*  So I think for me, those are them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  I think we'll become a crypto first country. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=366.8s)]
*  I think that ultimately we will embrace crypto and Bitcoin in a massive fashion over these next four [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=369.2s)]
*  years. And we'll see if the dollar is going to stand 30, 40 years from now, but I guarantee [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=376.4s)]
*  you Bitcoin will. And if we can make that part of our national reserves, so much the better. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  I like all of them. I hope they all come true. Those are awesome. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=389.76s)]
*  This has been an insane opening to 2025 in the technology realm. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=393.2s)]
*  We just had the inauguration with all of the tech besties in the front row. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=399.44s)]
*  We're talking Elon Musk and Mark Andreessen and Sam Altman. I wonder if Sam and Elon were [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=405.36s)]
*  arm wrestling while they were sitting there watching the inauguration occur. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=410.96s)]
*  And this has got to be one of the most tech forward administrations and ecosystem that we've seen. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=414.72s)]
*  And I have a lot of anticipation, putting aside all kinds of other issues that everybody has. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=425.76s)]
*  We have lit the fuse and we're on an exponential rocket ride. Do you agree? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=432.0s)]
*  100%. And if you go to our old mantra, which is that technology is a major driver of progress [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=439.36s)]
*  in the world, and as Ray says, it might be the only major driver of progress, then having it be [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=446.72s)]
*  a tech forward thing with policies and regulatory chasing with the tech breakthroughs is the right [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=452.56s)]
*  way to do it. And I'm excited by what will come from this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I have a lot of topics I want to cover here today. Give folks an overview. We're going to jump [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  into space exploration. I've got two of the billionaires battling it out. I'm so excited [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=469.28s)]
*  about that. We'll talk about AI, NVIDIA, CES 2025. We'll talk about Bitcoin, some interesting use [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=475.12s)]
*  on the Bitcoin world and humanoid robots and a few other topics. You ready, Salim? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=488.24s)]
*  All right. Hopefully, your entire EXO community is watching. I know my abundance community is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=489.04s)]
*  all plugged in and we're about to light the fuse on exponential abundance. All right. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=496.08000000000004s)]
*  Space exploration. I woke up and told my kids first thing in the morning, hey guys, today [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  is the seventh flight of Starship. They said, that's nice, dad. I'm playing my Minecraft games. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  I said, no, no, no, you got to understand this is Starship. It's a seventh flight. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=517.04s)]
*  So, did you watch it this week? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  I didn't, but I saw what happened. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=524.4s)]
*  I'm going to show two video clips here to kick it off. Now, I am a space cadet. I'm a Trekkie, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=526.7199999999999s)]
*  the Apollo generation for sure. And the first one makes my heart sing. This is the return [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=533.12s)]
*  of the booster, the largest structure ever sent into orbit. Coming back to land on the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=539.92s)]
*  Maxilla chopsticks. Let's take a quick look. So, I don't know about you, but this is poetry in [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  motion. This is the combination, the convergence of AI and sensors and material sciences and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=559.52s)]
*  compute. I get goosebumps every time I see it. It's got to be one of the biggest breakthroughs [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=566.56s)]
*  in the history of mankind. It is one of the greatest engineering feats of this young century. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  And of course, you're watching this. I have the kids there. They're like, yeah, that's amazing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=581.36s)]
*  Super cool. So, okay, now Starship is going to orbit and we're going to see if it can land as [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=585.28s)]
*  well. And of course, the entire data flow from Starship, which is the upper stage, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=591.28s)]
*  which is supposed to go around the planet, come back and land, goes offline. And what we learn, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=597.52s)]
*  the reason it went offline is basically- Good, it's about to fall on top of us. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=603.04s)]
*  What is it? It's Starship coming back in parts and pieces. I guess it was a fuel leak [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=614.64s)]
*  and fuel plus spark plus ignition doesn't look good on Starships. Did you watch that happen? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=619.92s)]
*  Not live, but I watched the videos of it. And it's space travel and the level, the amount of fuel, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=629.6s)]
*  the success criteria are so, so extreme. Everything has to go exactly right. And if anything goes [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=639.84s)]
*  slightly wrong, it goes catastrophically wrong. It's pretty binary. So it's kind of a miracle. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=647.76s)]
*  It's expected. It's sad when it happens, but this is the domain. Luckily, nobody on board, of course, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=652.88s)]
*  unmanned vehicle. This is testing all the way. You have to remember that we saw failures with Falcon 9. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=660.16s)]
*  In fact, going back to when Elon started SpaceX, the first three flights of Falcon 1 failed [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  before they had their fourth success. And then we had failures on the Falcon 9. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  But Falcon 9 has launched and landed repeatedly over and over and over again to be the most [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=680.72s)]
*  successful vehicle ever built across all countries, across all time. I love his tweet. He said, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=686.0s)]
*  success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed. And that's a mindset of an [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=693.1999999999999s)]
*  entrepreneur who's got his shit together and is funding. SpaceX had just completed [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=699.12s)]
*  another massive financing round to get Starlink fully deployed and get Starship built. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=704.88s)]
*  The thing that was amazing was that within 12 hours, it wasn't just Starship going to space. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=713.3599999999999s)]
*  There's also Blue Origin. So I've known Jeff since college days. I had started a group called [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=721.5999999999999s)]
*  Students for the Exploration and Development of Space. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=733.36s)]
*  Said to a young space cadet. And it started at MIT where I was. And then we grew up to a [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  national and international organization. And Jeff was the president at the Princeton chapter. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=743.6s)]
*  And I remember I met him in a coffee shop after he had started, not Starbucks, after he had started [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=749.8399999999999s)]
*  Amazon. And like, Jeff, what's this Amazon thing? I thought you were just in space. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=759.28s)]
*  And he said, yeah, I'm going to make my money on Amazon and I'll spend it in space. Well, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=764.24s)]
*  he's been true to his word. Blue Origin was founded in 2000. I think that SpaceX was founded around [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=769.52s)]
*  2001. Jeff had been a space enthusiast from his college days. He was at Princeton where Gerard K. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=779.36s)]
*  O'Neill was. And they launched the new Shepard, their suborbital vehicle, and new Glenn, which [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=787.52s)]
*  started in 2013. And so this has been an overnight success after 12 years of hard work. And here, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=796.24s)]
*  let's watch the launch of the new Glenn vehicle one second. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=804.96s)]
*  It never gets old. So what I find fascinating is these two billionaires, you know, amongst the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=817.52s)]
*  world's top 10 wealthiest, who transformed entire industries, building space companies now, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=839.92s)]
*  both of them enamored by space early on. Jeff's vision is going to the moon and then building [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=850.48s)]
*  what are called O'Neill colonies, which are not on Mars, not on the moon. They're free-floating, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=859.12s)]
*  large colonies that can hold initially tens of thousands and eventually millions of people [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=866.08s)]
*  that are orbiting the sun or co-orbiting with the Earth. And of course, Elon wants to go to Mars. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, Jeff's ready to spend a billion dollars a year. SpaceX is profitable, which is [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=879.2800000000001s)]
*  incredible and hopefully Blue Origin will be. It used to be it was Lockheed Martin and Boeing [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=886.1600000000001s)]
*  as the launch providers. And of course, they were supported, held up by the Defense Department. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=891.84s)]
*  But I think we're going to see SpaceX and Blue Origin suck the oxygen out of the atmosphere for [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=898.64s)]
*  most of the launch providers. It goes to the democratization aspect where anybody can take [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=904.08s)]
*  a crack at it. And now we're going to see a thousand flowers bloom in this. It's going to [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=911.44s)]
*  be incredible. Yeah. I mean, we're talking about bringing the price per kilogram per pound down [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=915.84s)]
*  a hundredfold. It's going to spark an entire new generation of new space economies. I still believe [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=921.84s)]
*  that, you know, mining asteroids, carbonaceous chondrites to get liquid oxygen and hydrogen [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=929.6s)]
*  in Earth orbit so you can refuel once you get to space or metallic chondrites so you can mine [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=936.1600000000001s)]
*  platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium in space and use that back down on the ground. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=943.12s)]
*  Everything you've ever held of value on Earth, metals, minerals, energy, real estate, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=951.76s)]
*  is in your infinite quantities in space. So it's going to get pretty interesting pretty quick. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=957.28s)]
*  I have two quick comments. Please. One, for me, the primary opportunity to back up civilization is... [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=963.84s)]
*  Back up the biosphere, yeah, sure. ...is the most interesting and important part because [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=971.84s)]
*  any asteroid is an existential threat to everything. And the second, for me, is always this date, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=977.0400000000001s)]
*  October 31st, 2001. And that was the date that the first astronauts lifted off of the International [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=985.6800000000001s)]
*  Space Station. And since then, we've always had at least one human being off planet. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=993.2s)]
*  And I just like select the first molecules bubbling off this thing. And I just find that really, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=999.76s)]
*  really haunting. Really amazing. You know, it's still brutal, by the way, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1006.0s)]
*  that it takes so much energy to get off the planet. You know, one of the things I find fascinating [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1015.4399999999999s)]
*  in this all-fields conspiratorial is if gravity was just a little bit more [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1022.9599999999999s)]
*  if the Earth was just a little bit larger, you know, we wouldn't be able to get ourselves [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1029.04s)]
*  off the planet. Or if we were just a little bit smaller, it'd be so much easier to get off the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1033.68s)]
*  planet. We're just at that level like in the video game where you have to struggle to get there. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1038.8s)]
*  Not by accident do we call it a Goldilocks planet, right? It's so true. This is where the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1044.56s)]
*  simulation stuff comes in because the conditions on Earth and the constants in the universe are [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1051.12s)]
*  so finely balanced. Oh, it's amazing. That it's like, wait. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1057.28s)]
*  So, I'm a true believer we are living in an nth generation simulation, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1062.3999999999999s)]
*  but let's not jump into that now. No. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1067.76s)]
*  I'll tell you, I did something. So, first of all, I've been enjoying the latest [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1070.16s)]
*  large language models. And every time someone says, well, there's this chain of reasoning, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1075.2s)]
*  large language model. I don't know if you have your favorite test to give that large language [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1080.08s)]
*  model for it to do something. Do you? I don't because I'm waiting for very [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1085.84s)]
*  practical use cases like the Steve Wozniak's coffee machine thing for AGI, which says to a robot or [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1093.12s)]
*  an AGI, make me a coffee. And it does all the stuff, measures that have rinds of beans, and [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1101.76s)]
*  knows enough, has enough intelligence to do that task end to end. And there's several tests for [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1106.48s)]
*  AGI. That's considered to be one of them. And I'm waiting for the interaction with the physical [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1113.12s)]
*  reality of space, of time and space, where things get very interesting. Because intelligence is [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1119.28s)]
*  really needed to manage our physical environments and adapt to the physical environment. That's [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1124.7199999999998s)]
*  where I think it will really shine as we build LLMs into humanoid robots and other robots. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1129.52s)]
*  Well, I was taking this out a different path. I once did a little, you know, mental experiment [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1134.9599999999998s)]
*  of how much energy or how much would it cost you to winch you and your spacesuit to orbit and to [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1142.8s)]
*  an orbital velocity. So if you weigh 100 kilograms and your spacesuit weighed 150 kilograms, let's [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1152.72s)]
*  round things up. And you had this giant winch that could efficiently winch you to 200 kilometers [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1159.36s)]
*  altitude, then accelerate you to orbital speed. And you could buy the electrical energy off of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1167.6s)]
*  the plug. How much would it cost you to get you and your spacesuit to orbit? Have you ever done [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1173.84s)]
*  that, ever asked you that question before? You haven't. And it's a very Peter Stahl question. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1181.12s)]
*  And what was the answer? Well, I did this manually. And then I plugged it into a large language model, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1186.0s)]
*  which, you know, sort of the Gemini 1.5 Pro version that does logical construct steps. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1192.56s)]
*  And it will say, OK, here's your potential energy. Here's your kinetic energy. If you buy it off the [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1200.8s)]
*  grid at, you know, 20 cents a kilowatt hour, it's like 150 bucks to go to orbit. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1206.32s)]
*  So what I mean by, you know, all of this energy, these, you know, hundreds of thousands of [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1213.76s)]
*  pounds of thrust in these engines, it's very grossly inefficient. Yeah. Compared to what someday [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1220.56s)]
*  we might have. Anyway, but still, thank you, Elon. Thank you, Jeff. I don't have to worry about [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1231.12s)]
*  opening up space. I spent 30 years there. I hand that to you. And I'm going to be able to [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1236.7199999999998s)]
*  hand that mantle to you. You're doing an amazing job. So grateful for all of that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1243.04s)]
*  It's so exciting to watch. It is just incredible. Yeah. All right. Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1249.84s)]
*  If you did, did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Labs, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1257.52s)]
*  that they spent billions on bio defense weapons, the ability to accurately detect [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1264.32s)]
*  viruses and microbes by reading their RNA? Well, a company called Viome exclusively licensed the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1269.84s)]
*  technology from Los Alamos Labs to build a platform that can measure your microbiome [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1275.9199999999998s)]
*  and the RNA in your blood. Now, Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called Full [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1282.3999999999999s)]
*  Body Intelligence, which collects a few drops of your blood, spit in stool, and can tell you so [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1287.04s)]
*  much about your health. They've tested over 700,000 individuals and use their AI models to deliver [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1292.48s)]
*  members critical health guidance, like what foods you should eat, what foods you shouldn't eat, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1298.0s)]
*  as well as your supplements and probiotics, your biological age, and other deep health insights. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1303.04s)]
*  And the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar. As reported in the [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1309.36s)]
*  American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, after just six months of following Viome's recommendations, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1313.84s)]
*  members reported the following. A 36% reduction in depression, a 40% reduction in anxiety, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1319.52s)]
*  a 30% reduction in diabetes, and a 48% reduction in IBS. Listen, I've been using Viome for three [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1326.48s)]
*  years. I know that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities. Best of all, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1333.44s)]
*  Viome is affordable, which is part of my mission to democratize health. If you want to join me on [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1339.84s)]
*  this journey, go to Viome.com slash Peter. I've asked Naveen Jain, a friend of mine who's the [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1345.3600000000001s)]

*  slash Peter. All right, let's go on to AI. We went through the early part of this month [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1356.56s)]
*  at CES. A few things there worth noting. And let's jump into a few of them. So the first one is NVIDIA [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1364.0s)]
*  Cosmos AI platform to train and develop autonomous vehicles and robots. We've said this before, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1373.28s)]
*  the incredible progress going on in robot companies. And they're probably, I was tracking [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1382.56s)]
*  originally 20, then 40, then 60. There's got to be close to 100 humanoid robot companies out there. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1388.56s)]
*  And maybe it was battery packs that were, maybe it was the motors, maybe it was actuators and sensors, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1396.8s)]
*  but without question, it's the AI multimodal large language models that are enabling incredible [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1404.72s)]
*  progress with robots these days. Mind boggling. Because when you can take an LLM and then apply [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1413.52s)]
*  to all of these different tasks and subtasks, I think the domain starts to move 10x, 100x faster [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1421.36s)]
*  than it did before. And that's just magical. Well, I mean, I think what's fascinating is [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1428.56s)]
*  NVIDIA has created a platform that high school students, college students, entrepreneurs around [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1433.84s)]
*  the world can start to develop their own autonomous robots and vehicles. So we're going to see some [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1440.24s)]
*  interesting entries in the first robotics competitions coming along. It's going to be crazy. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1449.84s)]
*  This is the first robotics for sure. I mean, if you think about when Sebastian Thrun won the DARPA [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1454.8799999999999s)]
*  challenge with his Stanley autonomous car. 1995? Yeah, thereabouts, those vehicles were traveling [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1463.1999999999998s)]
*  at like three to five miles an hour with all of these sensors and the AI trying to calculate, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1472.72s)]
*  do I go five degrees to the right? It sounds like the large language models right now [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1478.56s)]
*  NVIDIA's platform is able to integrate all the sensor data and make it super simple for decision [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1484.24s)]
*  making. I think this is going to, once you can create a platform environment, things accelerate [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1491.04s)]
*  very, very fast because new innovations get built into the platform and everybody benefits. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1498.08s)]
*  For sure. Always when you can put more and more functionality into the base operating system or [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1503.1200000000001s)]
*  into the platform layer and because of NVIDIA's position, they're going to see firsthand, hey, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1508.64s)]
*  most of the use cases are using this sub-function, let's build that into the end and it's just going [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1515.28s)]
*  to lift the whole playing field very quickly. What you're seeing is as well as NVIDIA is [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1519.84s)]
*  investing in these companies. They're coming in, you have to remember NVIDIA started as a gaming [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1526.08s)]
*  chip and then went on to Bitcoin mining and then went on to LLMs. If Elon's prediction on humanoid [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1534.48s)]
*  robots and the same prediction that we hear from Vinod Khosla, who will be at my Abundance Summit [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1541.6s)]
*  and we hear from Brett Adcock, who will be at the Abundance Summit, is that we're heading towards [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1546.56s)]
*  billions of these robots. It's a massive market for NVIDIA chips as well. They're creating [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1551.36s)]
*  their future. Here's another news piece from CES. NVIDIA projects Digits, a Grace Rockwell AI [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1558.8799999999999s)]
*  supercomputer on your desk. Desk-sized supercomputer for AI development, a thousand times more powerful [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1566.8799999999999s)]
*  than your average laptop for three thousand bucks coming out this May to a store near you. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1574.64s)]
*  This for me is even bigger than the previous announcement because for the cost of a very old [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1583.2s)]
*  used car, what used to cost, I mean look at the power that you now have to train an AI [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1595.3600000000001s)]
*  at a local level. But I think that the pressure will all move now to what data sets are you using. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1601.2s)]
*  And then the data set combined with the latest model will give you, plus the hardware like this, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1607.92s)]
*  blows the lid off everything. I mean the question becomes what can the average person now do [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1613.52s)]
*  given these large open source gen AI models and a supercomputer on your desk [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1620.32s)]
*  and robots roaming around your backyard or your home? I mean, I don't know how to put this, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1629.28s)]
*  but I don't think people are ready for what's coming. I believe that would be the understatement [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1638.32s)]
*  of the century, Peter. I mean, you know, look, we can't even grapple. Did you hear about the [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1645.36s)]
*  Uber legal case a few weeks ago? No, tell me about it. Okay, so an Uber crashed and a couple got [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1652.0s)]
*  badly injured. So they sued Uber and it was winding its way through the courts and they were going to [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1658.4799999999998s)]
*  get a big settlement. Except during this process, their 12-year-old daughter orders something on [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1662.9599999999998s)]
*  Uber Eats and when you click for Uber Eats, the terms of service says you can't sue Uber for [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1667.76s)]
*  anything. It validated the lawsuit. So this 12-year-old inadvertently invalidated the lawsuit [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1673.36s)]
*  of her parents and the judge is like, hey, she clicked the box, she's had authorized use for us [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1680.7199999999998s)]
*  and we can't even get that right. We can't even figure out how to manage internet. Forget all of [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1686.32s)]
*  the stuff that's going to come with robotics. You know, I used the example before, do I ask it to [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1692.3999999999999s)]
*  change the baby's diapers and what happens if something goes wrong? So there's... Are you [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1699.52s)]
*  really expecting all of a sudden? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not. We're not, thank God. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1706.24s)]
*  But the in the acts, the consequences, this unintended consequence of this are so profound [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1711.84s)]
*  of all of these, right? I'm struggling as to how we merge these into day to day life. I'm really, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1720.4s)]
*  really struggling with that. I remember back in 1988, I'm going back to ancient history, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1727.68s)]
*  all right, where most people listening to this weren't even alive yet. But back in 1988, I was [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1734.88s)]
*  running my first university, International Space University, and I was on the campus at MIT and [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1740.64s)]
*  the first Mac 128 came out and I bought, we had 104 students from 21 countries there, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1747.76s)]
*  a group of Soviet students, including two KGB agents as students in the group. We had [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1756.64s)]
*  six students from the People's Republic of China. We had students from the Emirates and from Saudi. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1763.3600000000001s)]
*  It was incredible melting pot, all focused on space. And remember putting these 128, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1770.0s)]
*  these Mac 128s on the desktop with the little floppy disk, right? Not a little floppy disk, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1775.2800000000002s)]
*  a little cassette disk, three and a half inch. And it was this massive intellectual liberator [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1780.56s)]
*  that you could go and create and copy files. And I mean, compared to this, it's probably, you know, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1788.88s)]
*  billions of fold more capable. I've been through the full arc. When I was in grade 10, I got accepted [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1798.16s)]
*  to a new university course and I was using punch cards to program a mainframe. To go from that to [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1805.76s)]
*  an Apple II, which was, you know, nothing. And then Bill Gates' famous comment, 640k RAM ought [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1814.32s)]
*  to be enough for anybody. And now to today where we have trillions of times better price performance, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1819.92s)]
*  trillions. It's just, it boggles a mind. And let's note this, by the way, for this announcement, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1826.48s)]
*  that Moore's law has just been shattered beyond belief with announcements like this. Just shattered. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1833.6s)]
*  I mean, Moore's law, which, you know, and also what Ray calls the law of accelerating returns, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1838.3999999999999s)]
*  which predates integrated circuits, you know, was roughly a doubling of price performance every 18 [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1844.3999999999999s)]
*  months to two years. And what we've seen is a 10xing per year, right? Last year on the abundant [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1851.6s)]
*  stage, Elon said he's seeing 10x every six months or 100x per year. Insane. So here's a [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1858.16s)]
*  fun announcement from our friend Sam Altman on his reflections. He says, we're two years of chat GPT. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1865.44s)]
*  Chat GPT grows from a hundred million to 300 million weekly users in two years. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1873.76s)]
*  Pretty impressive. OpenAI expects agents to enter the workforce by 2025. I just did a podcast with [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1880.24s)]
*  Mark Benioff. Mark and I have been, I think, buddies, close friends for quite some time. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1888.16s)]
*  And we had a very fun, he wanted to live in the now. And I was like, but let's talk about the [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1895.3600000000001s)]
*  future. He goes, no, let's talk about the now. I watched it, Peter. And for folks listening, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1899.3600000000001s)]
*  everybody should go watch that podcast episode. It was super fun. Benioff is like in this Zen state, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1905.68s)]
*  going, let's focus on the present and not what it's like to be. And Peter's like, what will it [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1911.8400000000001s)]
*  look like with a billion robots 20 years from now? Mark was just making fun of me on that. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1916.48s)]
*  So what's interesting though is, you know, Benioff has pivoted all of Salesforce to agents. And I [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1923.2s)]
*  think he has had to to survive. I think every company is going to have to pivot towards agents [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1930.16s)]
*  to survive. And one of the things Mark said is he's not hiring any new engineers using his internal [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1936.16s)]
*  agent force 2.0. He's increased productivity 30% without any new hires. And here's the bottom [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1943.2s)]
*  bullet point that that that Sam Altman put in his blog said, Open AI emphasizes gradual AI development [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1953.2s)]
*  for societal adoption, leading safety research and governance, basically saying he wants to improve [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1961.2s)]
*  safety research and governance by slowing things down. I kind of call bullshit on this. I don't [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1970.8s)]
*  know how you feel about it. You know, can we go back to the early days of generative AI? So [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1976.1599999999999s)]
*  that whole field of these large language models and intentions all you need was pioneered by Google. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1984.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1992.96s)]
*  And Google actively decided not to release any of this because, you know, they sort of felt things [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=1993.52s)]
*  were not ready. And then once chat GPT gets released and goes from zero to a million users in five days, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2001.6s)]
*  they have to respond and release. But we're in the midst of an AI war right now, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2012.08s)]
*  not between countries, but between companies. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2016.8s)]
*  Totally agree. And and what Sam's trying to do here is create a moat around the the the success [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2019.52s)]
*  of Open AI and protect it as much as possible so it can continue innovating. Right. I do think the [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2027.36s)]
*  for me that one of the biggest use cases for AI is going to be in governance, but specifically [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2034.72s)]
*  policy formulation. Right. I've used this example before where if you want to reduce inflation by [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2040.56s)]
*  1%, as a human being as a chief economist of a country, you're like, Okay, what do I do? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2045.52s)]
*  And you're completely guessing you have no idea. If you let an AI look at all the data and all the [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2050.64s)]
*  insights from all the banks and all the monetary cash flows, etc. and go well, if you want to do [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2057.04s)]
*  that, here are the five things you do, you're going to come up with such better policy for all the [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2061.84s)]
*  stuff it's gonna be it's gonna be ridiculous. I really hope with the all the tech bros in the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2066.24s)]
*  White House, that there's going to be some use here. I mean, for example, if you look at the [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2071.44s)]
*  regulations at local, state and federal for plumbing, for hairdressers, for any industry [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2078.16s)]
*  you want, and you said, here's all here's all the regulations, please figure out where all the [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2085.68s)]
*  conflicts are. And please figure out the simplest set of regulations that still give you 99% of the [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2091.68s)]
*  protection, but simplify it. Yeah. You know what I call it? I call it MVP, not Minimum Viable Product, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2100.08s)]
*  but Minimum Viable Policy. And I think that's where we're going to need to get to is to go, okay, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2107.36s)]
*  you want to launch this electronic widget with all the regulations of different voltage structures, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2113.7599999999998s)]
*  and what's the MVP, minimum policy you need to manage that environment, and they all figure it [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2118.64s)]
*  out. I guarantee you the conflicting policies and bullshit regulations around the wildfires, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2124.24s)]
*  oh my god, and fire protection. You know, one thing that's interesting is when at SpaceX, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2134.08s)]
*  when someone comes up with a specification, which is kind of the equivalent of a regulation [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2141.2s)]
*  in the government world, like the specification for this part is this, this and this, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2148.96s)]
*  they have to sign their name and provide their contact details so that five years later, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2153.84s)]
*  if that specification is like, why did we specify that? It blocks this improvement here. You can [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2162.4s)]
*  call the person and say, why did you do that? And I think that's the kind of thing that we need much, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2168.56s)]
*  much, much more of. But frankly, that for me is equivalent to documenting software. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2173.76s)]
*  When you document software, you write up, why did you do it this way? Why did you do this code of [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2180.8s)]
*  libraries? Do you perform this function so that somebody coming after you doing maintenance [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2184.96s)]
*  gets some sense of it? We'll be able to have AI do a lot of that now. Software maintenance is going [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2190.0s)]
*  to be a thousand times easier as a result of LLMs. And I think the same thing will happen with [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2194.8s)]
*  policy standard setting is for me one of the areas where you could really go nuts with AI, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2199.84s)]
*  because you could say to an AI, what's the best standard for this type of thing? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2204.4s)]
*  Right? It can be incredible. You just have to have the gumption to use it and get it into place. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2207.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. And I hope so. Because it will, I mean, listen, the US tax code. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2212.88s)]
*  Can we, can we please call bullshit on the US tax code? I mean, it's a challenge. It's a mechanism [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2221.28s)]
*  for keeping accountants and lawyers employed. This is, I think, the big challenge, because [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2227.36s)]
*  when you simplify a bunch of these areas, a huge amount of swaths of work and entire industries [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2232.32s)]
*  fall by the wayside. And are we ready for that demonetization and the impact that'll have? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2238.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So this comes out of Sam Altman's blog again this week. Quote, we are now confident we [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2244.08s)]
*  know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. I mean, that's pretty impressive. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2250.32s)]
*  We are beginning to turn our aim beyond that to super intelligence in the true sense of the word. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2258.56s)]
*  So, you know, I've had a lot of conversations, we'll talk about it, you and I at Abundance in [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2265.36s)]
*  March as well. Are we at AGI now? And what the hell is AGI in the first place? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2271.52s)]
*  That is my soapbox question. I go nuts around this. Before anybody is allowed to mention the [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2282.56s)]
*  term, please for God's sakes define it, right? I've done some searches on this. The best I've [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2289.52s)]
*  found is the tests that would indicate that you have AGI. And the coffee test by Wozniak is one [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2294.48s)]
*  of them. There's an IKEA test that says, can you take an IKEA box and build a piece of furniture [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2301.68s)]
*  from the box? There's a few things that- Listen, I don't know that my kids would do that because [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2308.48s)]
*  they'd probably revolt. But honestly, you know, most of the AI models are far more intelligent [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2314.8s)]
*  than me in almost every area from science and physics and knowledge and so forth. I mean, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2323.76s)]
*  why isn't that AGI? I think we keep on moving the goalpost. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2330.48s)]
*  Exactly the point I've been trying to make. I think we go- I've got the spectrum that I put [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2336.0800000000004s)]
*  together of, you know, simple signal from noise, detecting signal from noise to analytics, to human [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2340.48s)]
*  level intellect like emotional intelligence and spatial intelligence, to then you bleed into [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2349.28s)]
*  consciousness and super intelligence and hyper consciousness and so on. And I think we'll just [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2354.6400000000003s)]
*  keep moving along that spectrum and the test will be whatever we can figure out how to break through [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2359.6000000000004s)]
*  next. The Turing test was the first of them, next will be AGI, next will be super intelligence. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2364.6400000000003s)]
*  So I think everybody should agree, we passed the Turing test a while ago. We didn't notice. It was [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2369.52s)]
*  an imprecise definition and I think we're going to pass through AGI. If we haven't in the last six [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2375.76s)]
*  months, we will in the next six months. And people will say, yeah, we kind of passed it. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2382.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm still waiting. My test is when I get a phone call one day and I pick up my cell phone and it's [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2388.7200000000003s)]
*  my AI saying, hey, Peter, I just wanted to introduce myself. I've been living on the system and I really [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2394.32s)]
*  love what you're writing. Or you've been, you know, listen, I don't know about you, but I say please [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2399.1200000000003s)]
*  and thank you to Alexa and to Siri and to chat GPT and to Gemini. I'm very polite to the AI systems. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2404.0s)]
*  I want them to like me. Yes. An old colleague of mine was a bit of a genius CTO 20 years ago [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2412.8s)]
*  and I asked him what his purpose in life was and he said, I want to evolve to the point that my [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2421.28s)]
*  computer is proud of me. And I totally didn't understand that, but now I understand it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2425.76s)]
*  Now I understand it. That is hilarious. All right. Let's move on beyond AGI. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2431.9199999999996s)]
*  All right. Another thing in Sam's news is his statement about nuclear fusion. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2438.56s)]
*  Quote, soon there will be a demonstration of net gain fusion, but I would expect Helion, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2445.2s)]
*  which is the company he's backed, will show you that fusion works soon. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2450.8799999999997s)]
*  There's, you know, at last count, when I looked into this, there were 37 venture-backed fusion [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2455.52s)]
*  companies. Pretty impressive. And I think that one of the many definitive breakthrough spin-offs, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2463.04s)]
*  benefits of AGI will be fusion. Do you agree? No. Okay. I think the race is between getting to [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2473.52s)]
*  fusion, commercialized and stable fusion systems and a combination of solar and storage. Because [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2483.1200000000003s)]
*  if you have solar and storage at the right level of efficiency plus storage capability, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2490.32s)]
*  you don't need fusion. Well, let's parse this in two different places. So number one, what I'm [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2497.68s)]
*  saying is that getting fusion to work is a technical challenge. Yes. Of materials, of magnetic [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2504.56s)]
*  fields, of equations. And there's no question AI will have a huge impact and it will move the [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2513.4399999999996s)]
*  field forward very quickly because you can, you know, you can't just go to a computer and say, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2520.3199999999997s)]
*  very quickly, because you can take the existing set of unsolved problems in fusion and say, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2525.76s)]
*  figure out how to do them and it will come back to you. Yeah. Especially with the MatterGen stuff [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2531.6000000000004s)]
*  that we'll talk about shortly, but this is incredible what's coming. Yeah. Everybody, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2536.1600000000003s)]
*  I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's very important to me [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2539.84s)]
*  and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you love. The company is called [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2544.5600000000004s)]
*  Fountain Life and it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2549.1200000000003s)]
*  talented physicians. You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2554.88s)]
*  We're all optimists until that day when you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2560.4s)]
*  the emergency room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2565.92s)]
*  four going on. And you know, it didn't start that morning. It probably was a problem that's been [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2570.8s)]
*  going on for some time, but because we never look, we don't find out. So what we built at Fountain Life [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2576.56s)]
*  was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. We have four across the US today [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2584.24s)]
*  and we're building 20 around the world. These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2589.6s)]
*  a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2595.3599999999997s)]
*  cancer test, a full executive blood workup. It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2602.16s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease at the very [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2608.8s)]
*  beginning when it's solvable. You're going to find out eventually. You might as well find out when [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2616.4s)]
*  you can take action. Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. We look around the [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2621.76s)]
*  world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years to your life and we provide [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2626.5600000000004s)]
*  them to you at our centers. So if this is of interest to you, please go and check it out. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2632.0s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2639.36s)]
*  Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out to us for Fountain Life memberships. If you go to [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2646.4s)]
*  fountainlife.com backslash Peter, we'll put you to the top of the list. Really it's something that is [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2652.56s)]
*  for me one of the most important things I offer my entire family, the CEOs of my companies, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2659.92s)]
*  my friends. It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. Go to fountainlife.com [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2665.04s)]
*  backslash Peter. It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2672.96s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. So separate from that, then we've got three other [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2678.16s)]
*  energy buckets, right? There is solar and Ray Kurzweil long ago looking at the [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2685.7599999999998s)]
*  solar energy production curve said, listen, we're just a few doublings away from getting all the [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2693.8399999999997s)]
*  energy from solar that we need. And I think he's absolutely right. As you said, it's solar plus [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2698.3999999999996s)]
*  storage. Perovskite is coming online. There's an incredible company that I love called Paranova [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2706.0s)]
*  that's doing perovskite here in the United States, a lot of perovskite companies in China as well. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2714.56s)]
*  But then there's fourth generation nuclear fission, right? These are [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2719.2799999999997s)]
*  SMR small modular reactors, right? Which are now fail safe, meaning if everything goes wrong, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2726.96s)]
*  they're still radiation free and safe. And I think, you know, I've said I'd have one in my [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2734.24s)]
*  backyard that they're that safe. I mean, it blows on our mind that nobody's noticed we've been [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2738.88s)]
*  running nuclear submarines for 50 years without an accident. Amazing. What the hell? I mean, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2743.84s)]
*  okay, great. It's a bit clunky, but put a nuclear submarine in my backyard. I don't care. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2749.2000000000003s)]
*  It'll be safe and we'll get the energy we need. Why is this so hard for people to get? I don't [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2754.56s)]
*  understand. This should have been done 10 years ago. You could mount a takeover of New York by [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2758.96s)]
*  New Jersey with your nuclear submarine. So yes, fourth generation, even beyond the nuclear subs [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2765.6s)]
*  the last 50 years, the fourth gen SMR reactors are amazing. And then of course, the last bucket, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2773.52s)]
*  which is kind of sad to hear about, but it's people are still stepping up coal plants. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2783.2s)]
*  So I think we're in an energy race. You know, I've shared on this program a few times charts [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2789.36s)]
*  that looks at energy production increases in India, which is doubled energy output in China, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2797.52s)]
*  which is like tripled or quadrupled. And in the US, which is like this flatlined. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2804.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're going to increase. I think the country that's got the cheapest energy wins. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2809.76s)]
*  But I think it's soon going to go all to near zero. And then the usage of that energy is going to be [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2814.08s)]
*  what will happen. You are going to have a whole bunch of, you know, there's one of these laws [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2819.44s)]
*  that's about the more capacity you have, the more we use, right? Sure. And Jaron's law or something. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2824.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think that's where we'll just soak it all up. But it's not going to be a big deal. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2833.52s)]
*  I think that's where we'll just soak it all up. And but it'll be near zero cost. All of them will [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2840.2400000000002s)]
*  go to near zero cost. But when I say, you know, the more energy you have, the more you win, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2845.68s)]
*  I think that's a function of it drives everything. There's a direct correlation between energy and [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2851.92s)]
*  economy of a nation. I will call you on your own paradigm, sir, because you're operating from a [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2857.84s)]
*  scarcity mentality there and a zero sum mentality. If you operate from an abundance mindset, there'll [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2863.52s)]
*  be plenty of energy to do everything we need. Okay, we're not there yet, though. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2869.2s)]
*  We'll get there. And this next breakthrough, we're talking, you know, two days ago, Satya Natala, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2874.56s)]
*  the CEO of the most extraordinary company on the planet, Microsoft. I mean, listen, any company [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2882.96s)]
*  that has existed for how many decades, four decades, four and a half decades, and is still [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2890.48s)]
*  number one or number two on the planet. That's amazing. Yeah, that's amazing. Anyway, so Satya [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2898.24s)]
*  says today in nature, our matter gen model represents a paradigm shift in material design, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2906.16s)]
*  applying generative AI to create new compounds with specific properties. I'll play a soundless [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2912.9599999999996s)]
*  video just to have fun of what this what this looks like. But it's, it's pretty extraordinary, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2918.9599999999996s)]
*  just in terms of the idea here. And I talked about this on the abundance stage with the CTO [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2927.6s)]
*  of Applied Materials. Applied Materials. Thank you. And we were talking about the notion that [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2936.7200000000003s)]
*  we understand in sort of a three dimensional space of the types of materials, the types of crystals, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2943.44s)]
*  the types of, of, of, you know, volumetric pressure and temperature, we understand how [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2951.76s)]
*  these materials function for a limited number. But there's, there's adjacent predictability. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2960.0s)]
*  Yes. If we move, if we change from this atom to this atom, what occurs? Well, given all the [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2968.6400000000003s)]
*  knowledge we have material sciences, and I believe material science is the unsung hero [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2975.52s)]
*  of technology, right? It's like, you know, all of Moore's Law is made possible material sciences, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2980.88s)]
*  all of, you know, molecular biologies, material sciences. If we can predict new materials, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2987.84s)]
*  in this case, actually generate materials with the properties we desire, saying I want a material [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=2996.48s)]
*  that reflects, reflects or refracts light in this direction. Yeah. It's a game changer. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3004.08s)]
*  Game changer massively. All right. Can I, can I say if you have a few thoughts? Yeah, please. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3011.04s)]
*  I've been tracking this for a while, ever since we were talking about nanotech and materials, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3015.12s)]
*  science and molecular assembly at singularity. Yeah. Okay. And for me, this is one of the biggest [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3020.56s)]
*  breakthroughs ever. And it was inevitable. I've been kind of waiting for when will we have an AI [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3027.36s)]
*  model to do manipulation of molecules? And it looks like this might be it, because- [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3032.88s)]
*  Or atoms, in this case, and crystals. Right down to that level. It's amazing, the granularity now. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3037.76s)]
*  Because there was a huge breakthrough in about 2012, 2013 with a project called the Materials [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3043.76s)]
*  Project. And what they did was they took like half a million compounds and cataloged all the electrical, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3052.88s)]
*  chemical and physical properties of these compounds. So if you're a battery researcher [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3058.08s)]
*  trying to think about what might be better than lithium ion, you might guess that lithium sulfur [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3062.56s)]
*  or lithium air might be better than you sequentially, linearly go test that compound and see what comes. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3067.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, that takes a long time. It's linear. Right? Now you have this database, you can just literally [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3073.2s)]
*  say, give me a material compound that has this voltage threshold and this thermal retention, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3078.56s)]
*  and boom, it'll give you the five that you need, but now you still need to spit those out. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3085.6s)]
*  But now with AI applied to that database, you could basically say, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3089.68s)]
*  give me something that gets to this endpoint and figure it out yourself. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3093.44s)]
*  And this, I think, is a huge leap that AI will give you. And this is a very clear indication of [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3097.2s)]
*  where AI can help us bridge that gap that we've not been able to figure out ourselves. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3102.16s)]
*  And come up with stuff. This is for me the equivalent of alpha fold, right? Protein folding in [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3106.24s)]
*  the material science. This is the alpha fold of material science. And I think this is such a huge, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3111.04s)]
*  huge thing. I'm really thrilled to see it come up, happen and come about. And when you have a [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3116.4s)]
*  company like Microsoft kind of putting the backing behind it, it'll have stain power [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3121.12s)]
*  and people will be able to rely on it. I'm really, really excited about what will come from this. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3126.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. You know, Sandbox AQ, Jack Hittery's company, has also been doing similar work using the [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3131.44s)]
*  equations of quantum physics to predict molecular properties. So I love this handle on X. It's [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3141.68s)]
*  at Dr. Singularity. Yes. You should have that. He says, this is huge. Microsoft researchers [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3148.72s)]
*  introduced MatterGen, a molecule that can discover new materials tailored to specific needs, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3155.68s)]
*  efficient solar cells or CO2 recycling, advancing progress beyond trial and error experiments. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3160.64s)]
*  Instead of screening the candidates, it directly generates novel compounds [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3167.84s)]
*  given the prompts to design requirements. So, I mean, think about this. This is about [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3172.08s)]
*  high efficiency solar conversion. This is about catalysts that can remove salt from water, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3177.04s)]
*  CO2 from the atmosphere. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll give you one use case. Two things come for me in this, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3185.52s)]
*  in the extreme positive and extreme negative. Okay? Sure. A bad guy could say, find a compound [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3193.52s)]
*  that will create the equivalent outcome of gray goo. And that causes a problem. Right? And on the [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3198.64s)]
*  positive side, imagine you throw up, figure out a crystal or some compound that we can throw up into [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3205.84s)]
*  the atmosphere that will just crystallize all the carbon and have it cascade down to earth. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3210.64s)]
*  No. Right? We should be able to do this now in like minutes and figure out a way of getting it [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3215.7599999999998s)]
*  up there. And off you go, we've literally solved the climate problem. And the implications of this [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3221.76s)]
*  are absolutely profound. Yeah. You know, Steven Kotler and I are writing the next iteration of [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3228.88s)]
*  abundance from, we were in 2012, we're writing Age of Abundance, which will come out in 2026. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3235.84s)]
*  And it's extraordinary. This sort of technology begins to liberate food, water, energy, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3242.56s)]
*  healthcare, education. Everything. And by the way, let's talk about this offline, but it came across [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3251.8399999999997s)]
*  a company that may have solved a totally workable path to molecular manufacturing. Okay. Listen, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3256.64s)]
*  huge. What he was talking about is nanotechnology, right? We've talked about this from Eric Drexler, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3263.04s)]
*  who wrote Engines of Creation. That was a follow on to- [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3268.96s)]
*  Yeah. So take this screwdriver that I happen to have on my desk. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3275.12s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3278.56s)]
*  On specific reasons. Now imagine instead of creating the mold and then forging this piece [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3280.2400000000002s)]
*  of metal and then sticking it together, you literally by molecule by molecule assemble this [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3285.76s)]
*  thing like a- Atom by atom, yes. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3289.68s)]
*  But literally at a molecular level or an atomic level. And now you can essentially create anything [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3291.44s)]
*  for about a dollar a pound, I think was the number that Ralph Merkel threw out. And this [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3296.72s)]
*  now becomes really fascinating because you could create a computer just by the cost of the materials. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3302.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's called computronium. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3308.72s)]
*  Because for me, the big thing that blew my mind with 3D printing is that complexity is free, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3310.72s)]
*  right? Throughout history, the more complex an object, the more difficult it was to make. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3318.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3322.72s)]
*  And now with 3D printing, complexity doesn't matter because- [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3323.12s)]
*  And when you're not going to model it, boom, you're done. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3326.0s)]
*  And customization is free. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3328.0s)]
*  Customization and the third part around 3D printing is you can make things that couldn't be molded. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3330.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3335.12s)]
*  You can replicate objects that couldn't be molded and you don't need a mold now. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3335.44s)]
*  Richard Feynman back in 1958 wrote a very famous paper called There's Plenty Room at the Bottom. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3339.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3346.0s)]
*  And then Eric Drexler in 1986 wrote Engines of Creation. And we've been waiting for nanotechnology, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3346.64s)]
*  which by the way, if we get to nanotechnology where we can atom by atom repair or create, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3355.04s)]
*  that gives us immortality without question. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3364.96s)]
*  Infinite masses. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3369.04s)]
*  But I won't go there right now. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3370.88s)]
*  I hope you go there in the book though. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3376.08s)]
*  We'll go there in the book for sure. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3378.4s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3379.44s)]
*  But I want to hear about this molecular manufacturing. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3380.08s)]
*  We'll update you separately. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3383.84s)]
*  You know, one thing I've been tracking and I put this up in the Wall Street Journal [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3385.6s)]
*  is the battle between the large hyperscalers, the large language models. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3389.68s)]
*  So you've got OpenAI separate from Microsoft, right? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3397.12s)]
*  Linked but separate. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3403.2s)]
*  You've got Gemini from Google. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3404.08s)]
*  You've got XAI. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3406.24s)]
*  You have Anthropic. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3408.64s)]
*  Meta. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3410.56s)]
*  I've been just extraordinarily impressed by Google's march forward. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3411.76s)]
*  I don't know if you've been tracking what they've done with their latest Gemini 1.5, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3416.96s)]
*  their Gemini deep research. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3424.64s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3427.44s)]
*  It's unbelievable what this thing can do. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3429.2s)]
*  This is like the $200 a month thing. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3431.28s)]
*  $200 a month on chat GPT. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3433.84s)]
*  It's $20 a month for Google. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3436.0s)]
*  $20 for Google that one. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3437.28s)]
*  It's incredible that you can essentially build. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3439.3599999999997s)]
*  We will now accelerate a thousand times the amount of research [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3442.7999999999997s)]
*  and how quickly research gets done. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3446.64s)]
*  It's going to be incredible. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3448.3199999999997s)]
*  I love on Gemini and their deep research being able to go, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3451.8399999999997s)]
*  okay, this is what I'm interested in. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3456.0s)]
*  Go and please check on these and put together a thesis and write a report. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3458.48s)]
*  It will go off for 10 minutes to 30 minutes and build a research paper for you. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3463.6800000000003s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3472.6400000000003s)]
*  One of the challenges with OpenAI is their battle against Elon, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3475.2000000000003s)]
*  who is now in the White House. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3480.5600000000004s)]
*  Their battle for going from a nonprofit to a for-profit. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3483.36s)]
*  For-profit, yeah. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3489.0400000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3490.96s)]
*  I still love Google since I first met Larry and Sergey back in 2004. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3492.32s)]
*  Their hearts, like Jeff and like Elon, their hearts are in the right place. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3500.48s)]
*  You had a class of billionaires 100 years ago that were extractionary wealth. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3506.72s)]
*  Don't you call them the techno philanthropists in the abundance book? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3511.92s)]
*  Yeah, I call about, I talk about Larry and Sergey and Eric Schmidt is techno. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3515.76s)]
*  I find it really incredible. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3522.64s)]
*  If you went back, say 200 years ago, the richest people in the world had exclusively [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3524.48s)]
*  inherited their wealth and guarded it jealously, did nothing with it. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3528.96s)]
*  Today you have people, the richest people in the world have exclusively earned their wealth [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3533.68s)]

*  Jeff and Elon and it's fantastic to see. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3541.68s)]
*  I think it's such an important pointer to their true human nature of wanting to contribute [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3544.8s)]
*  and wanting to make a difference. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3550.7200000000003s)]
*  Going to that MTP concept we talk about, I can't say enough about it. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3552.48s)]
*  It's really been impressive to watch Google catch up radically and very quickly in insert [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3557.1200000000003s)]
*  AI into everything they're doing. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3562.96s)]
*  It's brilliant. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3564.6400000000003s)]
*  Brilliant execution. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3565.76s)]
*  You know, I've had a chance to know Elon well over these 25 years and money never enters [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3567.52s)]
*  into the equation. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3574.9599999999996s)]
*  It's always can I make a better product? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3576.8799999999997s)]
*  Can I achieve my MTP of Mars or sustainable earth? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3578.8799999999997s)]
*  It's just always about product engineering and creating an amazing product. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3583.68s)]
*  Period. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3587.52s)]
*  End statement. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3588.3199999999997s)]
*  Speaking about creating wealth, should we talk about Bitcoin? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3589.68s)]
*  Always. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3592.9599999999996s)]
*  Always. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3593.6s)]
*  Okay, this is a fun conversation we always have. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3594.3199999999997s)]
*  So our buddy Michael Saylor is, you know, I'm jealous, right? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3597.52s)]
*  Anytime someone can say, yeah, I just bought a thousand Bitcoin. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3605.6s)]
*  It's been a while since I could afford to buy a thousand Bitcoin. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3609.2s)]
*  So MicroStrategy acquires 1070 Bitcoin for 101 million at 94,000 per Bitcoin [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3613.12s)]
*  and has achieved a BTC yield of 48% in Q4 and 74% in fiscal year 2024. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3620.96s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3632.88s)]
*  Massive. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3636.32s)]
*  Michael invited me to his 100,000 BTC in years party. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3638.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to go, but what a great way to celebrate the year 2025. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3642.56s)]
*  Just an amazing thing watching this happen. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3647.92s)]
*  I'm so excited about where Bitcoin goes from here and all of the crypto stuff that's now [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3654.32s)]
*  going to happen, good and bad, right? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3659.12s)]
*  You've got these meme coins that are exploding out of the gate with total insanity. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3662.08s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3667.44s)]
*  But I'm still a massive Bitcoin supporter and fan. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3668.56s)]
*  I always have to credit you. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3672.56s)]
*  The first time I heard the term Bitcoin was from you on stage at Singularity University. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3674.16s)]
*  And I'm saying, what is he saying? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3679.92s)]
*  Bitcoin? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3681.2799999999997s)]
*  What is this thing? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3682.48s)]
*  It's like the first time I heard the term YouTube from Chad Hurley, one of the founders [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3684.4s)]
*  of YouTube, I'm like, with letter U tube? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3688.4s)]
*  Anyway, it was a while ago, guys, just to be clear. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3691.7599999999998s)]
*  And I want to restate this, right? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3696.24s)]
*  It looked for the first few years like so many attempts had been made at digital [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3697.92s)]
*  cash, digital gold, that you didn't know whether this one would last or not, because there [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3702.3199999999997s)]
*  have been many cracks at that pinata. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3706.7999999999997s)]
*  And then about 2013, 2014, it became clear that, okay, this is here. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3709.12s)]
*  I mean, just to show the numbers here, a year ago, Bitcoin was at $38,000 of Bitcoin. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3714.3199999999997s)]
*  Can you imagine going back and saying, oh, it's $38,000 today? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3721.12s)]
*  I mean, how much would you borrow to put into it? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3725.12s)]
*  And then up to up 170%. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3727.84s)]
*  But here's what I find absolutely fascinating. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3730.48s)]
*  Check this out. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3734.08s)]
*  So Bitcoin versus Micro Strategies. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3735.6s)]
*  So that blue line at the bottom that looks almost flat is actually Bitcoin over the year 2024. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3738.16s)]
*  And what you see on that gold line, appropriately, golden line here, is the return on Micro Strategies. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3747.44s)]
*  And so here's the numbers. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3756.4s)]
*  Between January of 2024 and January 2025, Micro Strategies has returned 693% [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3759.28s)]
*  versus Bitcoin returning 144%. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3768.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, what else is there to say? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3773.28s)]
*  It's the leverage play on Bitcoin with all of the different layers and bond instruments [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3774.8s)]
*  that Michael's engineered into it. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3779.92s)]
*  I think this is huge. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3782.56s)]
*  Of course, you have the downside. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3784.0s)]
*  If Bitcoin drops, then you have also an accelerated drop. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3785.92s)]
*  But if the umbrella thesis is that Bitcoin will go up over time, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3790.48s)]
*  which has held for now 15 years, this is about a solid investment that you could ask for. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3795.68s)]
*  Would you ever borrow against your Bitcoin and buy more Bitcoin? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3801.84s)]
*  I did that. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3805.68s)]
*  Remember that conversation we had when it was 60? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3806.48s)]
*  And we were all expecting it. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3809.04s)]
*  I did it at that time and I burned a third of my Bitcoin. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3810.08s)]
*  Lost margin trading. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3813.04s)]
*  So Lily won't let me do that anymore, smartly. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3814.32s)]
*  We found other creative ways of trying to get to the same outcome. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3819.04s)]
*  Like I've invested in ordinals, which are Bitcoin NFTs, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3822.7200000000003s)]
*  because they're a Bitcoin base so that if the NFT goes up, you get Bitcoin. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3826.2400000000002s)]
*  And that is a way of doing it. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3831.2000000000003s)]
*  I think we'll see a ton more plays on Bitcoin of ways of doing it. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3833.04s)]
*  But the core, it's too risky for me right now to do that. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3838.08s)]
*  Well, of course, we're alive now in a White House that is pro-Bitcoin. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3843.68s)]
*  What's the goal? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3850.16s)]
*  $20 billion of Bitcoin in the national treasury? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3851.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's bullshit, if I can kind of swear a little bit. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3854.96s)]
*  Okay, well, here's the half from Bloomberg. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3858.3199999999997s)]
*  Proposal to formalize a $20 billion U.S. Bitcoin reserve. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3863.12s)]
*  So why is it bullshit to you? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3866.88s)]
*  It should be half a trillion. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3868.7200000000003s)]
*  $20 billion is nothing. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3870.6400000000003s)]
*  And if you look at the annual budget, it's a drop in the bucket. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3871.84s)]
*  At least have to be a few percent. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3875.92s)]
*  Because then it could make a difference. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3879.44s)]
*  But not to diminish the monstrous shift towards crypto [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3881.76s)]
*  compared to the last 10 years of the administration, right? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3888.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, order may pause. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3891.84s)]
*  Federal crypto litigation, push agencies to review policies. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3893.52s)]
*  All right, so I'm actually shocked we haven't seen [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3898.96s)]
*  a much greater resurgence when this came out. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3903.36s)]
*  I think it's built in, it's priced in. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3906.0s)]
*  This is the price that popped from $50 to $100 with everybody going, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3907.76s)]
*  oh, now this is all going to happen. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3911.84s)]
*  So I believe that's all priced in. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3913.6s)]
*  Real quick, I've been getting the most unusual compliments lately on my skin. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3916.16s)]
*  Truth is, I use a lotion every morning and every night religiously called One Skin. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3920.64s)]
*  It was developed by four PhD women who determined a 10-amino acid sequence [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3926.08s)]
*  that is a synolytic that kills senile cells in your skin. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3932.16s)]
*  And this literally reverses the age of your skin. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3936.16s)]
*  And I think it's one of the most incredible products. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3939.44s)]
*  I use it all the time. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3941.6s)]
*  If you're interested, check out the show notes. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3944.0s)]
*  I've asked my team to link to it below. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3945.76s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the episode. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3947.6800000000003s)]
*  Humanoid robots. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3949.92s)]
*  Your favorite topic. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3952.16s)]
*  My favorite topic. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3953.36s)]
*  Listen, I just think it's going to be one of the biggest impactors on society. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3954.16s)]
*  I don't have to walk the dog anymore. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3960.4s)]
*  The robot can walk the dog. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3961.84s)]
*  The doggy robot can walk the dog. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3964.4s)]
*  So this is a company that I'm tracking. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3967.44s)]
*  So I've been tracking now aggressively 30 of the 100 or so robot companies. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3970.56s)]
*  And this is one that got unveiled early on out of China, out of Shenzhen called Unitree. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3980.16s)]
*  We're going to have this company at the Abundance Summit showing their tech. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3987.6800000000003s)]
*  They've got a humanoid robot, a couple of different dog prototype robots, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3992.4s)]
*  and their G1 bionic upgrade. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=3997.2000000000003s)]
*  This is a $16,000 robot. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4000.48s)]
*  I mean, honestly, that's, you know, I will buy one just to have in the garage. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4004.32s)]
*  For fun, if nothing else. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4009.92s)]
*  But check out this video. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4013.2000000000003s)]
*  Love the soundtrack. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4022.1600000000003s)]
*  It feels like the 60s. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4024.0s)]
*  Not to miss the soundtrack, yeah. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4025.36s)]
*  So this robot is running down faster than a speeding train. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4031.52s)]
*  The rails on rocks, up hills. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4036.56s)]
*  The smoothest walking humanoid and running robot in the world. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4040.6400000000003s)]
*  The best thing, it's going to make me feel tall. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4048.0s)]
*  It's only four foot three inches tall. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4049.84s)]
*  So we're going to have a couple of these walking around the halls at the Abundance Summit. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4057.28s)]
*  It's equipped with three lidars. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4063.1200000000003s)]
*  And this is where a multimodal AI comes in, right? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4064.8s)]
*  Where the AI understands what it's seeing, when it's being spoken to, and how to respond. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4068.24s)]
*  How many will you own? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4080.08s)]
*  I keep on asking you that. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4083.12s)]
*  I have my standard issues with this whole thing, okay? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4084.56s)]
*  I'll throw out two. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4089.2799999999997s)]
*  One is why the hell does it have to look humanoid when it could have three legs or four legs and do [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4090.72s)]
*  way more? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4095.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's, you know, it's... [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4096.08s)]
*  I've answered that question before. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4098.16s)]
*  I know, but that's why I still might beef around this. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4100.24s)]
*  It could be so much more, yeah, utility. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4103.2s)]
*  By the way, in the comments, tell Saleem that you agree with me that they should be humanoid [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4105.92s)]
*  robots and not have six armed, four legged robots. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4112.48s)]
*  I want to see an octopus. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4116.16s)]
*  I want to know it's a robot. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4117.76s)]
*  If it put clothes on, you'd have to think it was a human being that would freak everybody out. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4120.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4123.36s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4123.68s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4124.4s)]
*  It's T3PO and data didn't have six legs. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4125.04s)]
*  We'll anthropomorphize these too much too quickly. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4132.0s)]
*  Okay, second thing is you can have these little glitches and he goes, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4134.72s)]
*  somehow the robot suddenly thinks it's a cat and we can't get it down from the tree. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4139.36s)]
*  And you're going to have these incredibly crazy things happen and we're going to have [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4143.68s)]
*  to deal with a hundred little things. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4147.28s)]
*  The neighbor is going to call you up going, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4149.28s)]
*  can you please get the god damn robot out of my garage? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4150.8s)]
*  It's found an electrical power outlet and it's sucking all the juice out. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4153.36s)]
*  I'm coming over to sue you. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4156.88s)]
*  It's just going to go rampant with this stuff. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4158.799999999999s)]
*  And so, I think there's going to be quite a lot of mayhem [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4160.88s)]
*  as the unintended consequences of this thing play out. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4165.44s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4168.4s)]
*  But as I said before, it's going to be a comedian's dream watching this thing. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4172.16s)]
*  Robin Williams would go crazy with this if he was alive. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4177.599999999999s)]
*  Let's move on. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4182.4s)]
*  NVIDIA accelerates humanoid development. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4183.36s)]
*  Their GROOT blueprint allows developers to create massive data sets for training humanoid [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4187.44s)]
*  based on imitation learning. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4197.2s)]
*  And so, I think that's extraordinary. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4200.08s)]
*  Hey robot, watch me make my cup of coffee and make it exactly this way every time. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4203.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4209.679999999999s)]
*  I think this is massive. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4211.28s)]
*  Because not just that, it'll learn from 5,000 other robots making coffee [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4213.92s)]
*  and the improvement rate will be incredible. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4218.32s)]
*  And I think this may be the area where... [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4222.8s)]
*  You know, for me, if I think back to robotics, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4224.96s)]
*  the reason the robots are so powerful and so important in manufacturing [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4227.04s)]
*  is that when you're building a car, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4230.96s)]
*  you could have a robot open and close the door 5,000 times to test the hinges [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4232.64s)]
*  and the door lock mechanism, etc., etc. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4236.5599999999995s)]
*  And we just built incredibly stable cars very quickly [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4239.28s)]
*  because you could have a robot doing all of that, right? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4242.96s)]
*  And now when you have a collective... [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4245.76s)]
*  You just took a job away from my 13-year-old son. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4247.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you'd get bored in two seconds as a 13-year-old and walk off. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4253.4400000000005s)]
*  But now you can have 10,000 robots, 5,000 robots all making cups of coffee, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4258.56s)]
*  sharing that knowledge amongst themselves [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4263.04s)]
*  and really improving the collective set. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4266.24s)]
*  That... [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4268.72s)]
*  This is again one of those platform plays that lifts everything up. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4269.2s)]
*  I think this is huge. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4272.0s)]
*  So excited. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4273.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4274.16s)]
*  Well, here's a news item for TechCrunch that Samsung expands in robotics. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4274.8s)]
*  I think we're going to see all the major electronic manufacturers get into robotics. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4280.4s)]
*  It is low-hanging fruit for them to integrate with their world. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4285.04s)]
*  I have to say that I love Samsung as a company, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4290.08s)]
*  but their robot design looks kind of clunky and boring. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4293.44s)]
*  All right, listen, I'm sorry. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4302.4s)]
*  This is no optimist, no figure, not even a unit tree. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4303.76s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4309.68s)]
*  Hey, look, it's going to... [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4310.24s)]
*  1,000 flowers are going to bloom. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4312.56s)]
*  We have a Cambrian explosion of this stuff, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4314.4s)]
*  and it's going to create a huge, huge varied set of formats, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4316.4s)]
*  reuse cases, function capabilities. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4324.08s)]
*  It's going to be moving. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4328.08s)]
*  Function capabilities. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4329.52s)]
*  It's going to move very quickly because of that. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4331.120000000001s)]
*  I love this. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4334.160000000001s)]
*  This is Elon's prediction. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4335.4400000000005s)]
*  We're aiming to have several thousand of these built in 2025. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4338.64s)]
*  He's referring to the Optimist Gen 2. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4343.68s)]
*  Initially, we'll test them out on Tesla, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4346.56s)]
*  and then assuming things go well, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4349.84s)]
*  we'll build 10x that output next year. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4352.080000000001s)]
*  We're aiming for 50,000 Optimist robots in 2026, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4355.76s)]
*  and so as many as 500,000 robots in three years' time. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4361.12s)]
*  We talk about deceptive to disruptive, the doubling of small numbers. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4369.84s)]
*  When I interviewed him in October of this past year, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4375.04s)]
*  his prediction was 10 billion robots by 2040. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4380.24s)]
*  If you double 500,000 10 times, you'll get there pretty quickly. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4384.4s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4394.24s)]
*  What do you think about 500,000 robots in three years' time? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4395.36s)]
*  I think it'd be great, but given the time it took from his announcement of a robotaxi [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4399.28s)]
*  to actually getting it, I would like to take this with a grain of salt. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4403.599999999999s)]
*  But the trend is the important one. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4409.2s)]
*  If it happens in three years or four years or five years, it doesn't matter. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4411.68s)]
*  It's going to happen, and when it does, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4416.16s)]
*  it's going to be a game changer at so many different levels. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4418.4s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4423.68s)]
*  Let's turn the conversation in a different direction to close this out today. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4426.0s)]
*  Buddy, you just took part in something that is not technical, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4432.0s)]
*  but it is powerful. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4438.16s)]
*  That was your father's passing. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4441.44s)]
*  I think you had an experience that is worth sharing. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4445.679999999999s)]
*  It's not technology, guys, but it is extraordinarily deeply meaningful. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4451.2s)]
*  Salim, share. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4457.36s)]
*  My 97-year-old father, who lived alone and drove around until a few months ago, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4458.719999999999s)]
*  had an assisted death procedure up in Canada. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4464.56s)]
*  The process was you reassociate death with grief and loss and pain and suffering and whatever. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4470.0s)]
*  It's all negative, right? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4476.88s)]
*  Except what I experienced with him was the most joyous and ecstatic and blissful [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4478.72s)]
*  experience I could possibly imagine. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4483.360000000001s)]
*  If I go out with one-tenth of the ecstasy he had, I'll be very happy. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4486.0s)]
*  He was in total bliss. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4490.48s)]
*  When the procedure finished, I was sitting there kind of stunned. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4495.759999999999s)]
*  He had a couple of days to say goodbye to everybody. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4498.96s)]
*  We timed it. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4502.32s)]
*  We paid Beethoven the Ninth Symphony for him, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4503.679999999999s)]
*  which was his favorite piece of music at the end. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4506.879999999999s)]
*  He passed on. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4509.28s)]
*  I said to the doctor, I said, I don't know how to process this. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4511.12s)]
*  He was so happy. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4515.2s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4517.839999999999s)]
*  Because you've done this process. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4518.5599999999995s)]
*  She said, sir, you have no idea. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4520.08s)]
*  Most people that go through this assisted death process go out in that state [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4521.4400000000005s)]
*  because they have agency. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4527.2s)]
*  You can die with dignity and you can time it. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4530.32s)]
*  You can manage a schedule. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZl8LgixbYM&t=4532.96s)]
