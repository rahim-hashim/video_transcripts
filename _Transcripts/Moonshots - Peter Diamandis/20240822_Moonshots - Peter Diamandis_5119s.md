# The Man Taking on Tesla in the Race for Humanoid Robots w/ Brett Adcock | EP #116
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es)
*  I am curious how you think about Optimus and Tesla and Elon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=0.0s)]
*  So inspired by what Elon's done in the last like 20, 30 years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5.0s)]
*  It's been just unbelievable. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=8.0s)]
*  We need more like really real players. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=9.0s)]
*  I think Tesla's a really real player. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=12.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, highly capitalized, great engineering team. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=14.0s)]
*  And I think they're actually heading in the right direction. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=16.0s)]
*  I'm tracking the robot companies coming out of China. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=19.0s)]
*  I spent a lot of time touring kind of what high-rate manufacturing processes look like out there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=21.0s)]
*  And I was just, it was shocking. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=26.0s)]
*  I mean, listen, you're amazing, but the star of the show here is Figure 2. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=30.0s)]
*  So do you mind if maybe we open up this podcast with a quick look at Figure 2? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=34.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=41.0s)]
*  Well, I guess welcome to Figure. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=42.0s)]
*  Everybody, Peter Diamandis here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=47.0s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=48.0s)]
*  On today's episode, we're going to do a deep dive with Brett Adcock, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=49.0s)]
*  the CEO of Figure Robotics, Figure AI. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=53.0s)]
*  He's going to be giving us a tour of his shop and Figure 2, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=56.0s)]
*  his new robot release if you're watching us on YouTube. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=61.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about what he thinks about Elon and Optimus. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=64.0s)]
*  Talk about the robots in your home, when to expect them, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=68.0s)]
*  and his projection of 10 billion robots on the planet by 2040. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=72.0s)]
*  He just did a monster round with 700 million or so from OpenAI, Microsoft, Jeff Bezos, and NVIDIA. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=77.0s)]
*  And we'll talk about how he's integrating OpenAI's software into his Figure 2 robot. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=85.0s)]
*  An extraordinary conversation, one of my favorites. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=91.0s)]
*  All right, if you enjoy conversations like this, please subscribe. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=94.0s)]
*  Let's jump in over to Brett and Figure AI. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=98.0s)]
*  Hey, Brett, good to see you, my friend. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=102.0s)]
*  Yeah, Peter, thanks for having me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=104.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know for sure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=106.0s)]
*  It was super fun to come and visit your office, I don't know, it was like two months ago. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=107.0s)]
*  It was before you rolled out Figure 2. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=112.0s)]
*  And I have to say, you know, I said it to you there, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=114.0s)]
*  the speed at which you're iterating designs is pretty amazing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=118.0s)]
*  And I didn't feel that kind of an energy since the early days of me seeing, you know, SpaceX back at Falcon one days. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=123.0s)]
*  So congrats on that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=134.0s)]
*  You know, I think everybody really, I mean, listen, you're amazing, but the star of the show here is Figure 2. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=135.0s)]
*  So do you mind if maybe we open up this podcast with a quick look at Figure 2, if you don't mind? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=141.0s)]
*  Can we go take a quick sneak peek on the shop floor? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=148.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. Yeah, let's make sure it's not being used. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=152.0s)]
*  But let's give you guys a quick tour of the office. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=155.0s)]
*  Yes, well, I guess welcome. Welcome to Figure. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=162.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=165.0s)]
*  So we're, yeah, we're well over 100 engineers now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=166.0s)]
*  We're based here in Northern California in the San Francisco Bay Area. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=171.0s)]
*  We just unveiled last week, Figure 2, which is our second generation humanoid robot. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=176.0s)]
*  And we have right now we're manufacturing about one a week in our facility here in California. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=182.0s)]
*  And we have several of them here now on the floor. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=189.0s)]
*  So here's a quick look at Figure 2 robot that we're already starting some tests on right now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=194.0s)]
*  Amazing. I know your team is about to activate it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=202.0s)]
*  If you're going to say that the principal differences between Figure 1 and Figure 2, I mean, just for folks, you know, the company's like two years old or less, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=205.0s)]
*  You've gone from like zero to infinity super fast. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=213.0s)]
*  What's the difference between what upgrades that you may configure to her? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=216.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's it's there's several. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=221.0s)]
*  So your top five. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=225.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I think first is we've tripled the amount of CPU and GPU on board just for more overall compute and inference. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=227.0s)]
*  The second is we almost doubled the battery to about two point three kilowatt hours. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=235.0s)]
*  It's all on board the system in the middle of the torso here next to basically the compute in. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=240.0s)]
*  And GPU, we had all the wires all internal. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=245.0s)]
*  So no external wires, cabling, electronics. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=249.0s)]
*  That's really for reliability and for overall packaging. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=253.0s)]
*  We also have exoskeleton structure. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=257.0s)]
*  So all the outer shells of the robot actually take loads, which is opposed to how we did the first generation robots. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=260.0s)]
*  This would be like more akin to how you do it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=268.0s)]
*  Like I said, aviation, my last company Archer, we know the skins on the aircraft take the loads of the vehicle. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=271.0s)]
*  I think it's pretty unique here for a system like this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=278.0s)]
*  We also have six on board cameras. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=283.0s)]
*  So we have more perception, more ability to see our surroundings where the cameras on the on the robot here. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=285.0s)]
*  We have them in the head, in the back and in the lower torso. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=290.0s)]
*  And I assume that the exoskeleton helps you reduce overall weight of the robot. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=294.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's basically like overall, the parts will get a little bit stiffer as they get a little bit wider. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=300.0s)]
*  We found that having one structure for both crash loads and stiffness is the right ideal mass trade. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=307.0s)]
*  Figure one had kind of like both structure and outer shell for loads. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=316.0s)]
*  And that's just really not ideal where you, you know, like the structure is really sized by crash loads. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=321.0s)]
*  So then you end up having basically double mass in a lot of ways. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=326.0s)]
*  And the hands, have you made improvements on the on the hands on the robot? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=330.0s)]
*  Show us. Hold his hand and show us what it looks like. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=335.0s)]
*  These are our fourth generation hands now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=338.0s)]
*  And we made like quite a lot of improvements over the previous generations. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=344.0s)]
*  Better sensors, better packaging, better for mass, better strength, better speeds of the fingers. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=350.0s)]
*  Overall, just better dexterity and control of like fine grain manipulation that we're doing on board the robot. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=356.0s)]
*  We need to do like human like applications. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=362.0s)]
*  So the more here that we can do human like tasks and grab human like objects, the better for for generalization of the robot. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=365.0s)]
*  Amazing. And it's standing what about five, six, five, seven behind you? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=373.0s)]
*  Yeah. Amazing. All right. Thank you for the quick glass. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=378.0s)]
*  You want to pop back into your conference room? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=382.0s)]
*  I love the beams up there for carrying heavy weights. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=386.0s)]
*  How many how many how many figure robots are up and operational right now inside the facility? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=390.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have a little under 10 in our facility here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=396.0s)]
*  And then we're in process of building as of right now, basically one a week. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=400.0s)]
*  Amazing. You know, Brett, one of the things that that I saw when I was there, you know, you showed me figure one and then figure two, which had been released yet. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=406.0s)]
*  And then drawings for figure three, which I won't talk about, which looked beautiful. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=419.0s)]
*  But can you talk about your rapid iteration strategy here? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=425.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you think about generations and redesigning and rebuilding? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=430.0s)]
*  Because a lot of companies like get to something and then fix it and then sell it for a long time. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=435.0s)]
*  Doesn't sound like your strategy is that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=440.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think the rule of thumb here is that roughly you need probably minimum three hardware versions to get to a point where the hardware is [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=444.0s)]
*  relatively commercial, reliable, like bug free. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=456.0s)]
*  And our goal is to in the limit make this basically a software limiting issue for us, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=461.0s)]
*  which means we need really capable hardware that's really reliable, it's safe, it's low mass, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=470.0s)]
*  and it's like low cost and we can manufacture it really well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=477.0s)]
*  That's like a light, a lot of the bite off and like the first version hardware to get that right. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=482.0s)]
*  It's just too difficult. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=486.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like getting the iPhone one right and getting everything OK. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=487.0s)]
*  And I had the iPhone one and it was just not the greatest phone in the world. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=490.0s)]
*  But like iPhone three and four were like certainly the greatest phones in the world. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=494.0s)]
*  You know, safer cars like the Tesla roads. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=498.0s)]
*  They're probably not the greatest car in the world. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=499.0s)]
*  And I have three testers now. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=501.0s)]
*  They're incredible. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=503.0s)]
*  Probably the best car I've ever had. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=504.0s)]
*  So we basically want to be on this continuum of like rapid like hardware iterations where we're [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=506.0s)]
*  basically looking at different heuristics of things that we need to mature over those hardware [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=513.0s)]
*  continuum and making all necessary improvements so that the hardware is at some point very mature. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=518.0s)]
*  And I think our first generation hardware figure one was mostly trying to get the roughly the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=528.0s)]
*  architecture trades right. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=534.0s)]
*  So all the details of like the engineering system for you know, as batteries example, what is the energy? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=535.0s)]
*  Is it going to be hydraulic? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=544.0s)]
*  It's battery powered. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=545.0s)]
*  What type of battery cell chemistry from there? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=546.0s)]
*  What type of type of cell is it cylindrical? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=549.0s)]
*  Is it prismatic pouch? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=552.0s)]
*  You know, how are we going to how are we going to pack those thermal propagation like all those different trades you have? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=554.0s)]
*  That's just battery alone. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=561.0s)]
*  Then you have like the rest of the whole system so that you know, there becomes like an order of like 100 or 200 decisions [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=562.0s)]
*  you have to make to go out and build a robot. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=569.0s)]
*  And you know, you don't want to have to be a situation where you have to get all those right. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=571.0s)]
*  And I think we got most of those right on figure one. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=575.0s)]
*  We did even better job on some of those decisions on figure two. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=578.0s)]
*  Figure two is really about getting to a feature complete robot has all the systems on it, whether we're going to build or buy it on the robot that are working. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=582.0s)]
*  We built most of it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=589.0s)]
*  So that's software with those firmware embedded systems control software, all the hardware systems on board, the actuators, electronics, wiring, battery systems, cameras, sensors. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=590.0s)]
*  So and then, you know, so we think we got roughly to like feature complete hardware complete on figure two. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=603.0s)]
*  And so we're really excited there. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=613.0s)]
*  And then, you know, future generation for us will be how do we get the costs down by well over order of magnitude from where we're at now? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=615.0s)]
*  And how do we get the ability to manufacture an unprecedented scale that we've never seen before in robotics? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=622.0s)]
*  I know that, you know, one of the quotes I heard you say is everyone will own a humanoid and labor will be optional. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=628.0s)]
*  And those are pretty provocative. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=635.0s)]
*  And I think actually true. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=638.0s)]
*  Let's you know, for everyone to own a humanoid. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=641.0s)]
*  And I want to get into this for a quick moment. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=644.0s)]
*  You said reducing the cost 10x. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=648.0s)]
*  You know, Elon's been aggressive on a price tag. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=652.0s)]
*  He's not always been right on price or schedule. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=655.0s)]
*  But I think do you think of these these humanoid robots as a ultimately converging on a price per kilogram of total weight? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=658.0s)]
*  And what do you think, you know, 10 years out, 20 years out, these things will actually cost? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=668.0s)]
*  It's been the last like it's been all year now looking at how cheap we can make these robots. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=674.0s)]
*  And the answer really lies in like a bottom up bottoms up analysis of the entire build materials bomb, bomb cost, where we take basically a list of call it roughly a thousand parts. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=682.0s)]
*  And we like start automating that down and then we start understanding at real scale how we're going to procure those parts, whether we build or buy and what contractual, you know, volume estimates we can get with price prices there. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=695.0s)]
*  I feel it's super volume. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=711.0s)]
*  It's super volume dependent on pricing. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=714.0s)]
*  I imagine. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=718.0s)]
*  Yeah, every consumer device or car that we know of has been basically like balls of very high correlation with manufacturing volumes. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=720.0s)]
*  So the only real way to get, you know, consumer electronics prices down is by high volumes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=731.0s)]
*  That's the only way we know of. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=737.0s)]
*  So you really want to make a lot of the product to get the cost down. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=739.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I think like over a long enough period with enough high volumes, I think you're getting these costs down like sub twenty thousand dollars a unit, like really cheap. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=744.0s)]
*  That's amazing because if I were going to lease a twenty thousand dollar car, you know, that's costing me like a hundred bucks a month at most. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=755.0s)]
*  And so, you know, why not get two? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=765.0s)]
*  I was saying, especially if it makes you money, like if it can go out and do work and things like, you know, I could like actually be in the workforce or can do things that you would be spending time on during the day. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=768.0s)]
*  I think can actually be like a real utility here. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=780.0s)]
*  I think, yeah, how many I guess, yeah, how many would you want that if it could make you money? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=783.0s)]
*  Real quick, I've been getting the most unusual compliments lately on my skin. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=789.0s)]
*  Truth is, I use a lotion every morning and every night religiously called One Skin. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=794.0s)]
*  It was developed by four PhD women who determined a 10 amino acid sequence that is a synolytic that kills senile cells in your skin. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=799.0s)]
*  And this literally reverses the age of your skin. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=809.0s)]
*  And I think it's one of the most incredible products. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=812.0s)]
*  I use it all the time. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=814.0s)]
*  If you're interested, check out the show notes. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=817.0s)]
*  I've asked my team to link to it below. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=819.0s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the episode. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=821.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, when we first spoke, I remember you said something that was kind of shocking, but in retrospect makes sense. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=822.0s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said your estimate there would be a market by 2040 for as many as 10 billion humanoid robots. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=831.0s)]
*  Do you still hold to that? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=841.0s)]
*  If these robots can do everything a human can, I have to think that we'd be able to put three to five billion in the workforce. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=843.0s)]
*  And I don't see any reason why every human wouldn't want to have a humanoid like you do a car or phone. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=853.0s)]
*  Perhaps even more important than a car or phone where they can just do all the work that you just don't want to do all day, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=860.0s)]
*  whether it's walking the dog, getting coffee, doing errands, doing laundry, chores. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=866.0s)]
*  I mean, every day I go home and clean up the toys, right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=872.0s)]
*  So there's just like, I could have a robot just clean up kids' toys two, three hours a day, every day, no problem. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=876.0s)]
*  It's like endless work every day. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=883.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can imagine that. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=886.0s)]
*  There was something else you said, I think, that was really interesting. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=888.0s)]
*  You said it's a moral imperative to have these kinds of humanoid robots because as we get to AGI and digital super intelligence, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=892.0s)]
*  correct me if I'm wrong here, but you said if we don't have those humanoid robots, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=901.0s)]
*  the AIs are going to be having us do what they say. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=905.0s)]
*  And it's a lot better for the human soul if the robots are doing what they say. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=908.0s)]
*  So I think that's a good point. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=912.0s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong there, but that was an interesting point of view I hadn't heard before. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=914.0s)]
*  I think a pretty depressing future would be one that we solve AGI and that lives in a box, like not in the physical world. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=919.0s)]
*  And in order for that AGI to do anything in the real world, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=928.0s)]
*  it would have to ask or ask the AI to do something else. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=934.0s)]
*  And if it were to do anything in the real world, it would have to ask or force a human through wages or whatever to do that action. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=939.0s)]
*  And I don't know about you, but that seems like a really kind of downer future. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=951.0s)]
*  Please plug me into a higher, more kilowatt hours. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=958.0s)]
*  Yeah, like the collective consciousness of humanity's intelligence is sitting there wanting to do things in the physical world [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=964.0s)]
*  and having to pay humans through wages to do that or through force. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=973.0s)]
*  That just seems like, I don't know, just a terrible future. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=979.0s)]
*  I was interested in the mission statement you wrote. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=984.0s)]
*  I just recently saw some documents that you put out. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=988.0s)]
*  So the mission of FIGURE is expand human capabilities through advanced AI. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=991.0s)]
*  And that's, you know, I'm curious. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=996.0s)]
*  It didn't say about humanoid robotics. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1001.0s)]
*  It was, you know, expand human capabilities through advanced AI. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1004.0s)]
*  How did you end up there? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1008.0s)]
*  Do you see yourself as an AI company ultimately? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1010.0s)]
*  We do see ourselves as an AI company, a limit that happens to do robotics. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1012.0s)]
*  I think in the limit, all the challenges that we face to do what we set out in our mission are ultimately going to majority be AI problems and hurdles. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1017.0s)]
*  And I think there's this dream that we're all having here now at FIGURE where one day we have these robots out in the world doing like really important work. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1031.0s)]
*  It's really needed for humanity, helping to lower goods and services prices to hopefully bring a world of abundance. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1045.0s)]
*  And I happen to think that that'll free up a lot of the time me and you have. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1053.0s)]
*  We all have to do things like we really, really love. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1058.0s)]
*  Amplified by robots and AI, you know, to do far more per unit time than ever before. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1065.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1072.0s)]
*  Like if we could just spend time on what we really wanted to do, what would all humans do with their time? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1073.0s)]
*  I think that's one of the most important questions is what I recently I've been working on my next book, which is called Age of Abundance. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1079.0s)]
*  I heard you in a previous interview talk about robots enabling an age of abundance. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1087.0s)]
*  What do you how do you describe that? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1093.0s)]
*  What do you think that looks like? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1097.0s)]
*  What do you mean by an age of abundance? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1099.0s)]
*  Well, I think one of the interesting things about humanoids is we can put these robots in the goals of putting these robots into the physical world with no additional infrastructure needed for them to operate. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1101.0s)]
*  So you can put robots into the workforce. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1113.0s)]
*  We don't need to go build like new systems and new electronics and everything else for the robot to work with. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1116.0s)]
*  And it can just, you know, like a special purpose machine. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1122.0s)]
*  We go in there. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1124.0s)]
*  We got to try to architect everything and make new space and build a new machine and roll it out, integrate it like a humanoid just integrates right into the world. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1125.0s)]
*  You can just do human like things the next day. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1132.0s)]
*  And if we have robots, ultimately, we'll build robots themselves from a manufacturing perspective. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1136.0s)]
*  I was going to ask you that that iterates very quickly down to. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1142.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you can basically bring most manufacturing today. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1146.0s)]
*  It's just like got a bunch of machines and humans. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1149.0s)]
*  That's basically it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1151.0s)]
*  And if we can do human level manufacturing, you're basically at a point where you could theoretically have robots building robots. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1152.0s)]
*  The price here just collapses to nothing. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1158.0s)]
*  And those robots can be put into the world to do work. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1161.0s)]
*  So what is that cost of the work? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1165.0s)]
*  It's the cost of you renting the robot out. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1168.0s)]
*  And it's the cost of that land. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1170.0s)]
*  And if you have renewable energy on that facility like that, you know, this work area, then that cost would be very small. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1172.0s)]
*  And the output would be really high. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1179.0s)]
*  So you can basically create a world where goods and services prices are like, you know, trend to zero in the limit. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1182.0s)]
*  And and GDP spikes to infinity. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1190.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like, yeah, you basically can request anything you'd want would be relatively affordable for everybody in the world. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1194.0s)]
*  It's interesting when you when you look at GDP of countries, they scale with population and access to energy. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1203.0s)]
*  Right. And population and energy is work. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1211.0s)]
*  So it feels like this will become a mandatory part of any nation that wants to survive and thrive in the decades ahead. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1214.0s)]
*  I think it'd be super important to figure this out. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1224.0s)]
*  In your in your mission statement, you said, you said, hence the goal of figure is to develop general purpose humanoids that make positive impact on humanity and create a better life for future generations. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1228.0s)]
*  These robots can eliminate the need for unsafe and undesirable jobs, ultimately allowing us to live happier, more fulfilling lives. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1239.0s)]
*  And and I buy that. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1248.0s)]
*  You know, I I love the idea of robots doing the jobs that are dull, dangerous and dirty, cleaning the toilets, you know, cleaning the rooms, you know, because most people I think do work. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1250.0s)]
*  Most people in the world do work not because they love that work, but because they have to do it to get food or insurance, whatever the case might be. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1261.0s)]
*  And but the question ultimately is, I also think these robots will, you know, I'm I've got a niece who's who's a plastic surgeon and I'm like, don't go into that. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1269.0s)]
*  You know, robots are going to become our ultimate surgeons. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1280.0s)]
*  Is there any job you think that that robots aren't going to be able to take on if we want them to? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1284.0s)]
*  It certainly seems that over time, both digital and physical, intelligent robots will do more and more things a human can really well. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1293.0s)]
*  And I think we're really just like in, you know, we've been seeing that though technology over the last several centuries, but I think we're seeing that very much accelerate this slope of that curve is accelerating. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1305.0s)]
*  And it's accelerating in really interesting places with, you know, large language models and it's almost accelerating the wrong different direction than we probably probably thought like, you know, 10 years ago. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1316.0s)]
*  So I happen to think that over long enough period of time, we'll have automation fit with our physical or digital automation that we'll be able to do as probably the majority of things that humans can do today. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1330.0s)]
*  Just to note, I checked this morning and there are 8.2 million job openings in the US, right? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1342.0s)]
*  So it's not like there's no need for there's no jobs available. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1351.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the big news and congrats on this is the financing you just did, which is extraordinary. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1356.0s)]
*  Just for those who don't know, you raise 2.6 billion from OpenAI, Microsoft, Jeff Bezos, NVIDIA. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1368.0s)]
*  I know my own venture fund, full disclosure, bold as an investor, very proud of that. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1375.0s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1379.0s)]
*  Yeah, we raised 675 million. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1381.0s)]
*  Yes, at a 2.6 billion valuation. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1385.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're super proud. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1387.0s)]
*  We have like we brought a lot of new investors, including OpenAI, Microsoft, NVIDIA. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1391.0s)]
*  And yeah, great to have your support. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1396.0s)]
*  It was good. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1399.0s)]
*  It's giving us the ammo now to really take the next step in our mission of rolling these robots out commercially and making really viable. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1401.0s)]
*  And that's really where we're at right now. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1410.0s)]
*  It's like how do we take, you know, we're putting out cool videos and that's great. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1412.0s)]
*  But like the next big step is like how do we get those in the workforce working every single day? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1418.0s)]
*  And we're you know, we just showed that we just got back from BMW and you know, and basically close to two weeks, basically doing a full trial there. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1423.0s)]
*  That went really well. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1432.0s)]
*  BMW actually just put out a press release about that. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1434.0s)]
*  We'll be going back here in the near term. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1437.0s)]
*  And the goal is like to go back and do useful work continuously. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1439.0s)]
*  And we couldn't be more excited. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1444.0s)]
*  It was it was both hard because we were like outside of our comfort zone in the office. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1447.0s)]
*  Also, just like really energizing when we got back. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1451.0s)]
*  We're like, we can do this. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1453.0s)]
*  Like this can be done. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1454.0s)]
*  So that was like reinforcing. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1456.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're like everybody here is fired up that like we get a chance to try to go do this over the next few years. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1458.0s)]
*  And I didn't mean like post financing here, like what's holding us back now? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1464.0s)]
*  We have we have more cash than we need at the stage of the company we're in. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1468.0s)]
*  We have great partners like OpenAI helping us with models. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1473.0s)]
*  We have great companies like Microsoft helping us out with training and video on like GPU hardware, other simulation work. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1475.0s)]
*  We have like the world's best AI robotics team ever put together. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1482.0s)]
*  We have figure two now, which is I would say the probably top humanoid hardware in the world. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1486.0s)]
*  And we're doing some of the best AI learning work in the world. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1491.0s)]
*  You know, and we see this like small light in the tunnel, which is like this is what robots can really do. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1494.0s)]
*  So we're all just working really hard at that point. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1501.0s)]
*  Would you say that what you're doing now is only possible because of the state of AI? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1505.0s)]
*  I mean, is artificial intelligence and and a mass amount of compute the thing that made this possible now? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1511.0s)]
*  Because, you know, I mean, we've been talking about robots for God knows, you know, 50 plus years. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1519.0s)]
*  I built robots in high school and college. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1526.0s)]
*  I didn't call them robot. I mean, to call them robots, but they were nothing in comparison. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1529.0s)]
*  But is it now is it AI that made you say now I'm going to commit? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1533.0s)]
*  Because you put you put like one hundred million dollars of your own money into the kick this thing off, right? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1538.0s)]
*  Which which is a significant step for an entrepreneur. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1544.0s)]
*  I think there's only a few different things. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1547.0s)]
*  I mean, one is like the whole ecosystem. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1550.0s)]
*  It's not just like it's not just the models. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1553.0s)]
*  It's you know, the it's the overall infrastructure for for training, for inference and deployment, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1557.0s)]
*  deep learning algorithms that can like support like, you know, large scale imitation learning and reinforcement learning. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1566.0s)]
*  So there's just like a several billion blocks there on the AI side that are all like maturing to a point where you can deploy these policies, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1574.0s)]
*  like embedded, you know, embodied policies in the in the world and they work, which is pretty unbelievable. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1581.0s)]
*  Like I just got back from taking away Mo like last month in the city. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1587.0s)]
*  It was just like very special. And it's just like, you know, this pretty clear can just drive like a human can with enough data. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1591.0s)]
*  And the same with our robot. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1600.0s)]
*  When you see a robot in the facility doing kind of the new generation work that we're working on now, it just feels magical. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1601.0s)]
*  I think a separate thing is like the whole hardware system. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1607.0s)]
*  It's really hard to know if it was like 10 years ago. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1613.0s)]
*  This is really possible with like torque density of actuators, batteries, battery systems, energy density there. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1616.0s)]
*  I would happen to think that, you know, like the best humanoid robots 10 years ago were all hydraulic systems. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1623.0s)]
*  Those are like 3000 psi systems that we can hydraulic fluid all over the place. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1629.0s)]
*  Yeah, like leaking oil everywhere, like intractable to put next to a human. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1634.0s)]
*  You would kill you could kill a human with those next to those systems. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1639.0s)]
*  So like certainly that was the wrong architecture decision 10 years ago. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1642.0s)]
*  It'd been unclear for me if like 10 years ago that would have been possible. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1646.0s)]
*  Assuming you even had AI that you could build a electromechanical system that would work like we work at the levels we have now 10 years ago. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1652.0s)]
*  I would probably think not. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1660.0s)]
*  I do think it's I do think it's a convergence of a whole bunch of things. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1664.0s)]
*  I mean, the theme for my abundance summit next March is convergence. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1667.0s)]
*  And thank you for joining because I think I think what you're building is the is the exact, you know, sort of principal example of converging technologies, making new systems and new business models possible. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1672.0s)]
*  How did you how did you connect with open AI in the first place? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1687.0s)]
*  I mean, that's that's a big it's a big step. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1692.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to introduce the same a few years back and we got to know each other a lot better and spent a lot of time together in 2023. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1696.0s)]
*  And, you know, ultimately, they wanted to get back into robotics and specifically around like AI for, you know, embodied embodied systems. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1709.0s)]
*  And, you know, now here we are like working on like next generation AI models for our robots to make that work. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1720.0s)]
*  And they're supporting us on that. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1730.0s)]
*  That's been I would say so far 10 for 10 system. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1733.0s)]
*  We happen to think of the best of the best, you know, vision language models in the world, the best implementators of those models in the world. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1737.0s)]
*  And, you know, we're trying to push the boundaries now on how to push that work as hard and as far as possible in the robotic space, which we're just you know, we've just been starting last like several months. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1744.0s)]
*  I imagine there's a lot of benefits for them as well. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1759.0s)]
*  I mean, embodies mentioned embodied AI. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1763.0s)]
*  There's a lot. There's some theories that say, listen, we're not going to get to a GI unless we can embody a eyes to understand, you know, sort of the embodiment gives them an understanding of the universe and allows them to explore. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1766.0s)]
*  And then there's the other idea that we're going to hit a data wall to get to a GI and humanoid robots are a means for collecting a lot of data to help shape future models. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1777.0s)]
*  Can you speak to that a little bit? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1791.0s)]
*  I think I think it's becoming more and more clear that some of some level of output actions and planning better is important to take a kind of a next step in intelligence. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1793.0s)]
*  What we're trying to do here is we're trying to help complete that last leg of like actions and reasoning that we're seeing from kind of some of the best kind of world models that we're helping to work on here internally. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1808.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, if you can like talk to a robot and it can output actions like useful actions in the real world, that would just be an incredible technology for the world that we're trying to work on here, whether you want to call that, you know, advanced AI, whatever. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1826.0s)]
*  Like that's just such an important focal point for us to try to get to is how do we output intelligent actions into the world and do useful things. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1844.0s)]
*  So most of our focus on the AI side is on that topic and how to make that as scalable as possible and generalizable. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1855.0s)]
*  I mean, I have to imagine, you know, GPT-4.0 and or, you know, the multimodal versions of GPT-4 are key for you, right? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1863.0s)]
*  Having having figure C and be able to understand. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1873.0s)]
*  Was that a relatively when you started that didn't exist. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1877.0s)]
*  The multimodal models weren't there. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1881.0s)]
*  Was was that the conversation you had going on with Sam? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1883.0s)]
*  Was he sort of like, you know, sort of was he part of your inner conversation of what's going to be possible in the future? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1887.0s)]
*  I think I mean, like one of the biggest breakthroughs we have is we have like with LLMs and VLMs more specifically, we've had like this like semantic grounding that's occurred in robotics. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1895.0s)]
*  We have like the world's knowledge, like in a in some way, like, you know, the knowledge back in a zip file for the robot to access and understand in that bridge from like robot to human was never really here before. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1911.0s)]
*  If you want to talk to, you know, autonomous car and say, drop me off in the, you know, on the curb over there on the right, there was no real semantic bridge for that in the world. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1923.0s)]
*  And, you know, arguably, we have that now we have like the semantic bridge has been built in the world. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1935.0s)]
*  And what we're really lacking is this like, like, I guess, reasoning and planning and perhaps actions from that system to for us to provide useful work in a robot. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1940.0s)]
*  And so I would say you've had this like unbelievable technology has been opened up and we're seeing some really cool stuff right now in the world, like, you know, with different technologies all over the world in AI. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1951.0s)]
*  But like, one of the things people are not talking a lot about is like, what does this mean for robotics? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1962.0s)]
*  This means like a robot knows everything you're saying and knows those what you mean. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1967.0s)]
*  And we have all this grounded in human level data, meaning we have all this like semantic worlds knowledge is written by humans for humans, which is an incredible ability for a humanoid robot that looks like a human to really have really high efficiency transfer rates. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1972.0s)]
*  So we like the way humans open up jars is pretty similar to robots or humanoid robots to open a jar. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1990.0s)]
*  So like the Ford and says are roughly, you know, really high fordance levels as it relates to humans work. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=1998.0s)]
*  So this is like unlocks like an ability for humanoid robots to really tackle like general robotics, like how do we talk to robots and how do we output actions that everything a human can do? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2004.0s)]
*  And there's there seems to be at a point in time where we can really try to see if we can crack that. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2019.0s)]
*  So you mean that we're going to see the normal course of interactions with robots be like you speak to a human. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2024.0s)]
*  It's like, can you please go grab that for me? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2033.0s)]
*  And it says, what do you want me to grab? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2035.0s)]
*  And you say that thing over there and you point and it looks and it understands the stapler or the bottle of water. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2037.0s)]
*  And so it's got contextual knowledge and and geometric and what you call positional knowledge. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2044.0s)]
*  How far is that? Yes, this is all realistic today. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2052.0s)]
*  It's not it's beyond even all those things like in the neural net weights lives the material of the plastic bottle, roughly mass characteristics and friction characteristics and how it will feel to grab. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2056.0s)]
*  And all of this is in the weights. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2071.0s)]
*  I work I work on longevity because I want to see as much of this stuff as I possibly can. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2077.0s)]
*  Yeah. How what kind of hours do you work? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2082.0s)]
*  Because I know your passion, Brett, I know your dedication to this and you are a kid in a candy store. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2085.0s)]
*  What's what's your what's your and you have to balance families well. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2091.0s)]
*  What's your work week like? Yeah, I would say I work almost like basically almost seven days a week. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2095.0s)]
*  There's really no time. I'm like really not working. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2103.0s)]
*  Except with home like with a wife, wife and my kids. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2107.0s)]
*  Yeah. How old are your kids? Do they do they get what you're doing? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2111.0s)]
*  We just had a family day at figure. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2116.0s)]
*  So my daughter is five and like was like my son is too. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2119.0s)]
*  So we had the robots walking around. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2123.0s)]
*  All the kids were so excited. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2126.0s)]
*  It was really cool. Yeah, they get it. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2128.0s)]
*  They talk about dad building robots all the time. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2130.0s)]
*  And, you know, I think like, yeah, it's like, yeah, I think we actually had probably 50 kids here like last week, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2132.0s)]
*  like watching all of them like see the robots and touch them. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2149.0s)]
*  And yeah, it was pretty special. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2153.0s)]
*  You know, I think about that. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2158.0s)]
*  My boys are I've two boys are 11 13. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2161.0s)]
*  I can't wait to have them see what you're building here. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2163.0s)]
*  And I think about the fact that their future and your kids future are going to be, you know, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2167.0s)]
*  if your numbers are correct, and I think that they are, they will be more prevalent than cars are out there. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2174.0s)]
*  Right. There's like a million cars, like a million other vehicles. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2181.0s)]
*  And we could see, you know, five to 10, I'm sorry, a billion cars out there, a billion other vehicles. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2184.0s)]
*  And so it's going to be a very different future for them. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2191.0s)]
*  I asked a friend of mine, what's it going to be like when you're seeing humanoid robots walking around the street all the time in five years? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2195.0s)]
*  And his answer was interesting. He said, it's going to seem normal. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2202.0s)]
*  Yeah. Can I tell you something? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2207.0s)]
*  We. Yeah, a bunch of you know, we have a lot of folks here have been around robots for a long time. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2209.0s)]
*  They're like, yeah, as soon as we do something, everybody's going to be in awe and then nobody's going to care anymore. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2214.0s)]
*  It's funny. Sometimes that happens. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2219.0s)]
*  We were walking, you know, figure two now around the office quite frequently. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2221.0s)]
*  And the first few times, like everybody just like stopped doing work. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2226.0s)]
*  They're like fist pumping from the conference room or whatever, taking photos. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2229.0s)]
*  We have this like we have this really crazy video where everybody is falling around the robot. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2234.0s)]
*  The first time I walked in the office with like their phones out, you know, and we do it now pretty regularly and nobody cares. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2237.0s)]
*  Like nobody is like, oh, the robot's close to me. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2244.0s)]
*  Like, you know, like it's like it's pretty unbelievable how like used to all the stuff we get. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2246.0s)]
*  Right. And we adapt so quickly. It's like comes boring. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2253.0s)]
*  I mean, the first time I got like one of the first model X's and, you know, the the door wings come up and everybody's snapping photos and looking at it. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2256.0s)]
*  And then it's a nuisance after that. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2264.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2266.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2267.0s)]
*  It's the things really quick. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2268.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's even like using, you know, like large language models and stuff today. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2269.0s)]
*  I chat to you. It's just like I use it pretty frequently during the week. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2273.0s)]
*  And it's just like it's totally normal part of my workflow. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2277.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2281.0s)]
*  It becomes just an extension of GPT five. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2283.0s)]
*  Have you had conversations about integrating that and its derivatives or the mythical strawberries that's being unveiled? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2287.0s)]
*  Do you get any any early views of OpenAI's content for for for a figure? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2296.0s)]
*  No comment, Peter. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2303.0s)]
*  No comment. Okay. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2304.0s)]
*  Okay. Can't hurt to ask. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2305.0s)]
*  Everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you love. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2307.0s)]
*  This company is called Fountain Life and it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented physicians. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2316.0s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2324.0s)]
*  We're all optimists until that day when you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or four going on. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2328.0s)]
*  And, you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2340.0s)]
*  So that was a problem that's been going on for some time. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2343.0s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2346.0s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2349.0s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2355.0s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive blood workup. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2359.0s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2372.0s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2376.0s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2386.0s)]
*  You might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2387.0s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2390.0s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years to your life. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2393.0s)]
*  And we provide them to you at our centers. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2398.0s)]
*  So if this is of interest to you, please go and check it out. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2402.0s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2406.0s)]
*  When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out to us for Fountain Life memberships. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2410.0s)]
*  You go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter will put you to the top of the list. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2419.0s)]
*  Really, it's something that is for me one of the most important things I offer my entire family, the CEOs of my companies, my friends. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2424.0s)]
*  It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2433.0s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2438.0s)]
*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2441.0s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2445.0s)]
*  I am curious what you, how you think about Optimus and Tesla and Elon. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2447.0s)]
*  I know you have great respect for him as an engineer and entrepreneur. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2457.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts there? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2462.0s)]
*  I just like have to be, you know, so inspired by what Elon's done in the last like 20, 30 years. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2465.0s)]
*  It's been just unbelievable. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2476.0s)]
*  I think they're doing a great job at Optimus and I think they have a really good engineering team. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2479.0s)]
*  I think they're making really good progress. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2484.0s)]
*  And I think they're actually heading in the right direction. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2486.0s)]
*  Like the vector for where we need to go as a society to integrate and build humanoid robots. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2490.0s)]
*  I think they're following a very good direction. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2496.0s)]
*  So I think they're going to be, you know, a really real competitor with us. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2500.0s)]
*  I think the world needs them out there doing this. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2506.0s)]
*  And yeah, I hope them, I hope they do really well. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2511.0s)]
*  I think we're at a point in time where the window has just opened now for humanoid to be possible. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2514.0s)]
*  I don't think it was really possible 10 years ago. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2521.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's going to be this a little bit of a race here to get volumes out the door in terms of manufacturing [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2523.0s)]
*  and you get the AI training sets built and deployed on the embodied systems. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2532.0s)]
*  And yeah, it's going to be like a more important time to make this really work. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2537.0s)]
*  So yeah, I think overall just like very, I think they'll do very well and I'm very glad they're tackling it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2542.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think when he walks into a new industry like that, he credentials it in a big way. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2549.0s)]
*  Did they serve as sort of a stocking horse for you to keep the team? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2554.0s)]
*  Do you guys like look at it and go, oh my God, how'd they do that? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2559.0s)]
*  Or, you know, ours is better. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2561.0s)]
*  Is it provide a little bit of that kind of like gamified motivation for the team or you guys just open loop otherwise? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2563.0s)]
*  I think we try to like make we try to make all of our decisions from like a first order reasoning. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2570.0s)]
*  Like what was the right decision to make if that's super important for every company to really do is like I think we have our own mission vision values. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2575.0s)]
*  What we care about very different than any other company and we want to head a certain direction like vector space like that. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2583.0s)]
*  We think it's the right way to go longer term. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2589.0s)]
*  So I think that's like where we really ground ourselves and like the decisions we make. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2592.0s)]
*  I think there'll be things that we do a lot differently than other groups, you know, longer term because we're just making these decisions like in a vacuum with knowledge that we have and going through that. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2597.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're a really good competitor. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2611.0s)]
*  So for sure, we want to be we want to be winning and we want to compete, you know, overall. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2613.0s)]
*  We so yeah, I think, you know, our goal is to build the best humanoid robotics company in the world over here. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2619.0s)]
*  Figure and I think the since since the marketplace is arguably near infinite, there's plenty of room for for two or three significant players on the planet. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2628.0s)]
*  I think they'll be like I think the way I look at it is we need more like really real players. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2640.0s)]
*  I think Tesla's a really real player, like I mean, you know, highly capitalized, great engineering team heading the right direction, like longer term, moving fast through those high rate iteration cycles and milestones that are needed for engineering teams that really [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2646.0s)]
*  prove out the product is getting commercially viable. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2660.0s)]
*  And what we're lacking in humanoid space is that like we have a lot of groups that have been around for a long time or on the hoop. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2663.0s)]
*  And, you know, it does not look like there would be a lot of players that all win. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2671.0s)]
*  It looks like there'll be very few that make it through this like chasm crossing the chasm here that's needed for the market. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2676.0s)]
*  And I think many will die trying to, you know, trying to bridge this. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2684.0s)]
*  I hope that we live it figure. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2689.0s)]
*  But like we have like 14 peaks to go climb. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2690.0s)]
*  Now we have like a very hard road ahead to go from where I'm now, which is like two year old company. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2692.0s)]
*  To like a commercially viable, like a real business. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2698.0s)]
*  And that's what we need to go do. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2701.0s)]
*  We have like years, single digit years to go prove that and get into market. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2703.0s)]
*  So like that's we're charging forward as hard as we can to ship our product into customers and make it useful. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2708.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think, you know, I think most people probably don't realize is you're only two years old, right? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2714.0s)]
*  And what you put together in terms of team. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2719.0s)]
*  And I think this last round of financing, if I looked at what, you know, if you had said to the average person or average technologist or venture capitalist, what's the advantage that Elon has for for Optimus? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2722.0s)]
*  It's he has a menu fact. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2732.0s)]
*  He has a car company there that could use it. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2734.0s)]
*  He's got compute. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2736.0s)]
*  He's got capital. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2738.0s)]
*  I think this last round gave you parody, if not in some places. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2739.0s)]
*  It's like it's such a it's just like a such a stupid argument, though, because like you could say that about every company that's and why they can't be disrupted. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2747.0s)]
*  You could have said that those are all Texas weaknesses 20 years ago when they didn't have any of those. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2754.0s)]
*  None of them already make electric cars and somehow they won. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2759.0s)]
*  So like that's not really what happens in real life. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2763.0s)]
*  Like, that's not the that's not those attributes do not set the winner. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2765.0s)]
*  I'm not telling the winner. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2769.0s)]
*  I'm just saying that you those attributes were advantageous and and now you've got the capital. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2771.0s)]
*  You've got the compute with open AI and you've got BMW and so forth. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2777.0s)]
*  So I think like all the building blocks that we need to do to build a healthy company are all like starting to show up. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2780.0s)]
*  And that's good because we need like those are like requirements that are needed in our long term roadmap. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2786.0s)]
*  And we just got to put all those pieces together very intelligently and then not die in the market and make it work. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2791.0s)]
*  Not dying is a great part of the business plan. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2798.0s)]
*  Can we talk about China? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2801.0s)]
*  Because I find that absolutely fascinating. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2802.0s)]
*  So China succeeded on the backs of low cost labor and that's going away. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2805.0s)]
*  We hit we hit covid and no one wants to manufacture another shipping costs. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2811.0s)]
*  And so I'm tracking the robot companies coming out of China because I think that for so many reasons, like their aging population, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2816.0s)]
*  their one child, you know, per family policy, all of that and trying to actually maintain a manufacturing base all requires robotics. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2824.0s)]
*  I see you in a tree and a few others. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2834.0s)]
*  What do you think of the Chinese robots? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2836.0s)]
*  Are there any that seem like good competition out there? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2839.0s)]
*  I just got back from China a couple of months ago and it was one of the best visits I've done in my career, to be honest. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2842.0s)]
*  Went to a bunch of kind of like manufacturing focused companies in mainland China. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2848.0s)]
*  And it was just it was crazy. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2855.0s)]
*  Like I we were touring one facility and I was like, what's that written on the wall over there? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2858.0s)]
*  And they're like, oh, that's just our motto for this building. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2863.0s)]
*  I'm like, what does it say? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2866.0s)]
*  They're like, if you're having a bad day, just work harder. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2867.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, these guys are they're animals over here. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2870.0s)]
*  They're just like they're just trying to build and ship. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2874.0s)]
*  The work ethic was really high. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2879.0s)]
*  The sheer will of the country to try to be a good be like compete and win is really high. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2882.0s)]
*  And I was floored. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2889.0s)]
*  I was just I was like, man, you have you have like many times before. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2891.0s)]
*  I've not been there like I would call it like a lot. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2896.0s)]
*  And, you know, specifically was like it's been a lot of time touring kind of what high rate manufacturing processes look like out there. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2901.0s)]
*  And it was just it was it was shocking. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2908.0s)]
*  I think I think the you know, I think we have in the human space like we have like, you know, figured an optimist here outside of China. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2913.0s)]
*  I do think China is like the next group of folks that are are going to be really competitive long term in the human space. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2923.0s)]
*  I think they have to be. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2930.0s)]
*  You know, I used to when I used to go to China every year and bring a group of abundance members with me and we'd go and visit all the top tech companies. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2933.0s)]
*  And I remember the motto there was nine nine six like a great lifestyle was nine a.m. to nine p.m. six days a week. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2941.0s)]
*  That was the work ethic. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2947.0s)]
*  And, you know, everybody trying to had the had the reputation as being copycats. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2949.0s)]
*  But, you know, sure, they copy a lot of things, but they also did a lot of authentic new development work there. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2955.0s)]
*  Is that your experience as well? My experience has been that those folks out there want to win. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2963.0s)]
*  They want to do it at the lowest cost. They want to do it at the highest rate and they'll stop at nothing to try to try to try to be number one. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2970.0s)]
*  And that's that's that's like, you know, think about what startups are. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2978.0s)]
*  It's like it boils down to like those key principles you start a company with that are successful. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2983.0s)]
*  You you have nothing and it's just sheer willpower to get there and to go win. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2987.0s)]
*  And they have that spades in China and they do not have the resources we do here in the states. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=2992.0s)]
*  Is that you know, we said before, does that really matter that you have like all these things or is that is that is that is ultimate crutch? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3000.0s)]
*  And so I think I think there are going to be some unbelievable robotics companies come out of China just for this, just because of the sheer number of projects being worked on and with the will that I saw out there is second to none. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3007.0s)]
*  I mean, I think in the same way that Israel developed an amazing defense industry because they had to to survive. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3025.0s)]
*  I think China and Japan and South Korea with dwindling populations and aging populations are going to need to develop an incredible robotics industry to survive and thrive and maintain a GDP. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3031.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you you take Archer Public, which was an incredible success. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3044.0s)]
*  And congratulations on that. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3051.0s)]
*  And after starting that running that for a number of years, you break away to found figure. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3054.0s)]
*  And if I'm correct, you know, you made a commitment. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3062.0s)]
*  You put a significant amount of capital on the table to start the company, which you were able to do because of your previous exits from from veteran and from from Archer. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3066.0s)]
*  But I think when I when I first heard your presentation and I brought it to my venture fund, what I was so impressed by, which clinched the deal in my mind was the team you built. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3078.0s)]
*  I mean, it was an extraordinary group of engineers from the top A.I. and robotics companies or tech companies out there. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3090.0s)]
*  Can you word of advice for founders who are starting the company? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3101.0s)]
*  I mean, you're you're a technical founder as well, which is important. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3106.0s)]
*  But how did you recruit your team? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3110.0s)]
*  Yeah. So my belief is that in order to ship like a really good high quality product, you need the world's best team there to go do that, especially against like the difficulty level. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3114.0s)]
*  We have a figure of like succeeding, like the odds of success are always like pretty low. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3129.0s)]
*  So you like just you need to give it everything you got. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3132.0s)]
*  You need the best team here, you know, on site every day, you know, work hard. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3134.0s)]
*  You know, you need to have like a high functioning workaholism. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3139.0s)]
*  So I so I spent the first year basically trying to map out what the what the organization needs look like in terms of skills and [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3144.0s)]
*  like what does the ultimate work charting do to support like a really high functioning team to build a product? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3157.0s)]
*  And I spent the first year just basically head hunting all that whole team by hand. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3162.0s)]
*  And like, you know, cool, I was cold emailing and calling drafted off letter would give the off letter, go do dinners, try to close on board, you know, 30, 60, 90 day on boarding, bring them in, lead the engineering decisions [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3167.0s)]
*  and direction and, you know, work on those projects with those teams. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3183.0s)]
*  Like, I think, you know, it's been a huge payoff because we've gotten like now this point where I think we have like one of the better teams ever built in the world for this. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3187.0s)]
*  And it's like snowballing. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3196.0s)]
*  We're able to track a really high quality talent over all our disciplines. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3197.0s)]
*  But in the early days, in the early days, Brad, I mean, how do you get that first dozen? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3200.0s)]
*  Was it your conviction? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3206.0s)]
*  Was it, you know, your capital commitment to it? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3208.0s)]
*  I mean, because in one way you had you had Tesla bot, I don't know if it was called Optimus back then, you know, and so Elon tends to suck the oxygen out of a room on the stuff that he does, you know, convincing people to jump where they were and join you. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3211.0s)]
*  Was it, how did you do that? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3230.0s)]
*  Because that Jiu Jitsu is really important. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3232.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the pitch for early figure was we're working on humanoids. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3234.0s)]
*  We have this big mission to advance human capabilities with AI. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3239.0s)]
*  We believe in AI first in the market. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3242.0s)]
*  We believe a vertically integrated approach to hardware design is important. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3245.0s)]
*  We're living in the largest TAM or working in the largest TAM in the world. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3249.0s)]
*  It's, you know, well under half of GDP is human labor. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3253.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll fund the first several years. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3255.0s)]
*  There's no funding risks in the near term. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3257.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's my second time going around building hardware and building a hardware team. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3259.0s)]
*  So, you know, having done it, I think decently well at Archer, you know, we're getting back in the unit from scratch, did even better this time in terms of like setting the right direction and mission vision values to the team. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3265.0s)]
*  And then I just spent a lot of time with those folks saying, you know, come here. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3275.0s)]
*  Let's go out and build this commercial. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3279.0s)]
*  Let's build the best organization we possibly can from early days. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3281.0s)]
*  The early folks got all like founding, you know, founding member stock, which also was helpful and beneficial. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3285.0s)]
*  Got good salaries. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3290.0s)]
*  I was, you know, funding myself. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3291.0s)]
*  So it was like, you know, it was being a part of like a from scratch startup, but like almost like cushioned by my ability to self-fund it for multiple years. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3293.0s)]
*  Good equity. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3300.0s)]
*  You know, by the time we had five or six people in the team, they were all superstars. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3302.0s)]
*  And then that was like more risky for the next, you know, five or six folks that were joining. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3305.0s)]
*  So I was able to find folks that really believed in the space and believed in me. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3310.0s)]
*  A lot of folks that used to work with me, my last two companies, a lot of folks that were new as well. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3315.0s)]
*  I had, you know, I had my first two people were folks that I've worked with that, you know, were like my first employee at Vetterie, my early employees at Archer that I worked with. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3321.0s)]
*  They were like, you know, so it was, you know, three of us, they won basically that have all worked together. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3329.0s)]
*  Added some more folks on my old team at Archer, added some more folks from Boston Dynamics and other other organizations that were really great. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3335.0s)]
*  Soon enough, we had a dozen people that were superstars and their discipline. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3342.0s)]
*  And then, you know, we walked our robot within 12 months of incorporating the company. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3347.0s)]
*  So we worked really hard and got out of the gates pretty fast. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3351.0s)]
*  And, you know, now it looks like, OK, you know, it looks great. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3355.0s)]
*  It was great then, but I was in a WeWork phone booth for five months making cold calls trying to convince and talking to, you know, wives and husbands and telling them to convince their, you know, spouse to join. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3359.0s)]
*  And it was it was hard. Yeah, not going to lie. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3372.0s)]
*  I bet. What did you give the the chances of success back then in the early days or to get to the point where you are now? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3375.0s)]
*  I mean, if you had to give a thing back then, you like. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3384.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I would not have ever assumed that we would be out of place now. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3388.0s)]
*  We've really, you know, we I think there's the like, you know, I look at everything as like how well is the product doing as it relates to like the road map into commercialization? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3391.0s)]
*  We're still, you know, we're not like we're not successful. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3400.0s)]
*  Like, we're not even like shipping. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3403.0s)]
*  Yeah, like I think that like, you know, we've been around for, I don't know, like 20, you know, a little over a little over two years or something like that. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3404.0s)]
*  Unbelievable, like the amount of the hardware that's doing the AI systems and working on those policies like the look at the humanize now versus like 10 years. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3414.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable. And we don't ever walk into the office and like things go backwards. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3424.0s)]
*  Like they always go forwards. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3430.0s)]
*  Like we're not like, you know, sometimes we have like a couple of days where like, you know, a couple of robots break and we don't make progress or fix them or whatever else or a lot of meaningful progress. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3431.0s)]
*  But most weeks were like making pretty decent like if folks are gone for a week, they come back and be like, this is a whole new company. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3441.0s)]
*  It feels like so like, you know, every every week goes by, we're making pretty substantial impact. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3447.0s)]
*  So I would say like we far exceeded my my early impressions of where we'd be at two years from now. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3453.0s)]
*  Yeah, two years ago. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3461.0s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3462.0s)]
*  What did you think would be really hard that turned out to be easy? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3463.0s)]
*  Nothing easy, but was easier than you expected. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3468.0s)]
*  Well, I thought I maybe like the opposite will do. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3472.0s)]
*  I thought like we'd be able to procure a lot of supply chain to go build the robot like electronics boards, motors, actuator systems, battery pack systems, cameras, like lights, like speakers. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3475.0s)]
*  Like we like speakers on figure two. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3490.0s)]
*  I thought maybe go to Alibaba or go to Amazon and buy a screen like basic screens, speakers, lights. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3493.0s)]
*  These things have to be bought off the shelf, right? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3500.0s)]
*  Like you have to go buy those things and they come in from Amazon and you put them on a prototype like that's like that's like what that should be that easy. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3503.0s)]
*  It's it's still not that easy. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3511.0s)]
*  Like we're making custom speakers like how is it possible that we're making custom speakers in writing custom firmware for some of those areas like how is that even it doesn't make any sense that that's even possible. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3513.0s)]
*  So going into it a little naive of like these sensors for torque cells or whatever like would be procured and would come in. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3525.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have to do it like we like we make our torque cells like four cells here, which is like a flexure, the board. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3533.0s)]
*  They need to be gauged. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3541.0s)]
*  They need to be calibrated. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3542.0s)]
*  If you test it integrated, there's like there's software and firmware on those on there like like like and like that's got to work then at really high high rates like it just still boggles my mind. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3543.0s)]
*  There's no like mature supply chain across all this stuff. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3554.0s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3556.0s)]
*  And I'm assuming that that's not your first choice that you'd rather buy from a reliable supplier versus vertically integrated everything. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3557.0s)]
*  Everybody would always choose to buy something if it's like easy to procure and not the only vendor in town. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3566.0s)]
*  Everybody would always choose to buy nobody in the right mind would ever want to build in that case. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3573.0s)]
*  It just enormous effort and burden to maintain it and to QA it and to fix bugs and pay human salary and manage humans. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3578.0s)]
*  It's just like it's just a hard it's like a hard thing to do. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3587.0s)]
*  And damn humans. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3590.0s)]
*  You'll get you'll get through the human phase pretty soon. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3592.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3595.0s)]
*  What percentage of the robot is manufacturing house do you think like rough orders like seventy five percent ninety percent by whatever but whatever metric you want weight or cost. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3596.0s)]
*  We probably look at how much of this work we're designing ourselves. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3607.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3614.0s)]
*  I don't know the exact number of top ahead but I have to think it's probably like seventy eighty percent of things we're designing at this point for the robot. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3615.0s)]
*  There is an advantage of controlling quality and and pulling out overhead or margins out of the vendors. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3623.0s)]
*  I remember I was I was visiting Elon shop in the early days and he was in this conversation by some supplier because it's a lot of these suppliers are all defense. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3632.0s)]
*  Aerospace in there just extraordinarily expensive and he was like screw them. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3643.0s)]
*  We'll just make it ourselves was was the attitude. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3648.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3650.0s)]
*  That's what we like. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3651.0s)]
*  We've been around for two years so most of the engineering decisions around the bill of materials and the supply chain would have been let's get speed by getting parts in the robot get robots to AIs you know A.I. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3652.0s)]
*  engineers controls engineers let's get work done. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3665.0s)]
*  So we would have made those decisions quite quickly to outsource that work to get robots up and up and running faster. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3668.0s)]
*  So and I think longer term we would have worked the supply chain to own it better to have less risk to reduce like the margin profile across all the supply chain. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3677.0s)]
*  But there's just like yeah I think we thought that was easy. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3691.0s)]
*  It became like a bloody hell. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3695.0s)]
*  So what's what's what's the flip side of this thing that you thought was going to be hard and turn out to be easy. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3697.0s)]
*  Would it would it maybe be the A.I. integration. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3702.0s)]
*  Did I mean when you started did you imagine you're going to have to build out your own A.I. models. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3705.0s)]
*  We still do like a lot of our own A.I. models here which is like maybe not super well known but like but we do have a whole A.I. team we do most of the lot of work ourselves. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3711.0s)]
*  I would say across this we leverage some group like you know open A.I. really work with on new models and stuff and use their like VLM for some things. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3726.0s)]
*  So I think then that's been really helpful. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3735.0s)]
*  I think A.I. systems is probably the one that's been like wow this is really working and it's you know you think about like the split of like what percentage of the things are you going to have to hard code and code to go do which is like you know more classical controls and heuristics. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3738.0s)]
*  What percentage of things can we do through neural networks. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3754.0s)]
*  And I you know I would I would have thought going into this my I guess my thoughts two years ago is like you know a large percentage of the stack would be written in heuristics and code called like 95 90 percent. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3757.0s)]
*  And then as we are able to you know write neural nets for those that are at equivalent performance we will just take those level of like code or C++ and remove it with a neural net. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3770.0s)]
*  And it's kind of been flipped. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3782.0s)]
*  All the new ones is working for like a small team with like you know we don't have like a ton of tooling and infrastructure and things almost like right off the bat with like everything like just like like using slam or perception systems and object detectors and planning and speech to speech reasoning. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3785.0s)]
*  Everything everything the stack like the high and low levels have been working incredibly well. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3805.0s)]
*  And so yeah I think it's pretty magical. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3810.0s)]
*  I just like it would take us such a long time to code all this stuff. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3813.0s)]
*  Did you see the movie Oppenheimer. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3816.0s)]
*  If you did. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3818.0s)]
*  Did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Labs that they spent billions on bio defense weapons the ability to accurately detect viruses and microbes by reading their RNA. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3819.0s)]
*  Well a company called Viome exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos Labs to build a platform that can measure your microbiome and the RNA in your blood. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3834.0s)]
*  Now Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called full body intelligence which collects a few drops of your blood spit and stool and can tell you so much about your health. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3845.0s)]
*  They've tested over 700,000 individuals and use their AI models to deliver members critical health guidance like what foods you should eat what foods you shouldn't need as well as your supplements and probiotics your biological age and other deep health insights. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3855.0s)]
*  And the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3870.0s)]
*  As reported in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine after just six months of following Viome's recommendations members reported the following a 36 percent reduction in depression a 40 percent reduction in anxiety a 30 percent reduction in diabetes and a 48 percent reduction in IBS. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3875.0s)]
*  Listen I've been using Viome for three years. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3894.0s)]
*  I know that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3896.0s)]
*  But for now Viome is affordable which is part of my mission to democratize health. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3901.0s)]
*  If you want to join me on this journey go to Viome.com slash Peter. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3905.0s)]
*  I've asked Naveen Jain a friend of mine who's the founder and CEO of Viome to give my listeners a special discount. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3909.0s)]
*  You'll find it at Viome.com slash Peter. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3915.0s)]
*  I remember you talking describing to me the time when figure one put the cure cup in made you a cup of coffee and you were like we're trying to code this and then we just had them watch somebody do it like a dozen times and and they were able to model it. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3919.0s)]
*  I'm curious you know is the way you're interacting with with figure two like hey watch me pick this thing up and put it over here and now you do it. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3935.0s)]
*  Is that conversational you know and the visual models is that where the state of the practices. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3943.0s)]
*  Yeah we're like literally talking to a robot to go do something and it does it. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3951.0s)]
*  So what's like the most interesting thing you've had figure you know do for you. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3955.0s)]
*  I mean we can literally talk to our robot and it can like do tasks right now which is like unbelievable I mean like the in state for this is you really want the default UI to be speech you just want to talk to the real I want to when I'm like like a like a kid. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3977.0s)]
*  I another now another way to think about it is like I'm on the robot I'm like you know one way to do is like I pull my phone out or my laptop out and I'm like you know opening terminal and like trying to get a command to the robot to go do something and the robots are standing right there listening and I'm just like I just it just like once that we talk to you just want to just be like put all this stuff away and just be like figure to you know go do this and we're doing that now and it's just magical it's it's it's. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=3979.0s)]
*  It's really clear that the default UI for human robot is going to be speech. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4009.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4013.0s)]
*  You just want speech speech reasoning to get really high and you ultimately at the end state want to talk to robot have it be able to learn as this in the environment through vision and sensors and you want it to get better over time and it certainly seems like they were heading in that direction. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4014.0s)]
*  Yeah I remember rethink robotics used to like move the hand for them and say do this again but yeah I mean speaking to it and and showing it what you want if it doesn't understand. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4032.0s)]
*  I mean where are you on safety and and how do you make sure there's no like errant firmware upgrade turns robots into you know overpowered slayers you know I mean there's enough there's enough dystopian Hollywood movies that I want to you know bring them forward but how do you think about safety how important is that you know I mean I think that's the thing that's really important. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4043.0s)]
*  Bring them forward but how do you think about safety how important is that where does Asimov's laws come into your mind and practice there's like many ways to think of those we have like the like this system safety engineering side of like making the robot like actually really safe when it walks around the facility and does things with next to humans. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4068.0s)]
*  There's a whole like architecture architecture it's actually designed from top like like the bottoms up to make that a safe safe system that ultimately we can like put a safe hardware system into the world and it will basically react like we would want it to in all these different various conditions. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4086.0s)]
*  And I think that's just one piece like we need to like safe hardware around humans there's another piece of like cyber security and other things like we don't want anybody to have like root access to the robot and be able to take command of robots and to do potentially bad malicious things with them. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4104.0s)]
*  And then you have other things like what happens on the onset of AGI how does that really impact the safety of the robot. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4121.0s)]
*  So I think there's like many things we're doing here as it relates to like the low level like read only like firmware on the robot as it relates to like what it like what is like the lowest level code sitting at the robot that can't that can't be overridden say so more kind of like the three three laws. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4130.0s)]
*  I mean it's pretty cool you get to you get to think about you know the laws of robotics you want to instill in your robots. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4149.0s)]
*  Yeah I think you got I mean like a lot of this stuff is like if we don't think about this now we have to do like full architecture rebuilds which affect the system quite a lot so we kind of have to start thinking about all this stuff now to design. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4155.0s)]
*  So help me understand this so right now can a robot mechanically have enough velocity and torque to harm you. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4167.0s)]
*  Because a lot of the sort of automotive robots you know they put cages around them and so forth and there have been designs where it's like okay I'm just going to make the robot so it can't build enough velocity it can't outrun you it can't you know so you put that kind of a constriction on it. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4176.0s)]
*  I mean the robots like 150 pounds you know it certainly has enough like gravitational potential energy no matter what to hurt you so if it fell off a bunch of stairs and was falling on you like it certainly could hurt you so like no matter what I think whether it even has like you know torque sensing applied so it can't hurt you next to you. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4192.0s)]
*  There's certainly a scenario where it could be harmful no matter what so I think yes this is for sure a system that can be harmful to humans if not designed properly. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4213.0s)]
*  Or has like a certain episode or like fault on the robot that like somehow like is next to human and hurts them so this is something that has to be done very thoughtfully from the beginning as like system safety architecture. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4224.0s)]
*  And then we have to gradually prove out performance of that safety system over time through an incremental approach like our first robots in our in the work cells in the workforce will be isolated from humans. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4240.0s)]
*  If humans enter those work cells we will shut the robot off over time we will go from there to like fully next to humans. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4255.0s)]
*  You know collaboratively and that will be like a gradual. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4263.0s)]
*  Time frame best guess is that two years five years. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4267.0s)]
*  I actually don't like we're mostly concerned on trying to get the performance up of the system in the first few years in the reliability that's probably the hardest thing we have to do like getting you want to go and see a robot like working full like whether it's like you know it's like a light curtain like an artificial cage. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4271.0s)]
*  I think solving like a collaborative robot next all humans longer is like super solvable I think the hardest hill we have now to climb which is harder than that is getting the robot to do end to end work every day without like failure. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4288.0s)]
*  I mean it makes like local failures like sometimes I miss like I miss an object but I go and re grab it so we can like we can fail locally but not globally we need like we have certain performance outputs like let's say we go into a warehouse. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4304.0s)]
*  They're gonna have some amount of output per day of packages or whatever they're going to do of skews don't need to go hit if it's a bunch of robots doing that they'll still have those same performance goals. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4316.0s)]
*  So we know if we miss a package we just got to deliver it the right way on time so what I guess what I'm trying to say is yes there's I think I think we'll solve this decade humanoids around humans and interacting with them closely but it'll but before you ever see that you'll see it's like the analogy of the way my right you saw in Waymo in certain permitting areas of San Francisco before you saw in other cities. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4325.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4342.0s)]
*  You show it with the practice drivers in the seat you know watching everything. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4343.0s)]
*  Yeah you've seen it with everything even like autopilot right like you've seen it on highways doing it well as for beta testing the new software updates for other types of concept operations so like I think for us we're just you know we're at this period where we're just going to be doing the same things we've been doing. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4348.0s)]
*  You know we're at this period now where we need to prove that it can work and do useful work even on a confined perspective and then over time like yeah we got to build in the right system safety certification almost to like make sure it's ubiquitous it can walk around humans it can like give items to humans it can you know and we'll have certain things that we can do to make sure that we're doing the right thing. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4361.0s)]
*  Do you think as a mob's laws should actually be incorporated? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4377.0s)]
*  You know they're pretty fundamental you know don't harm a human or do something that causes a human to be harmed or by you know not do something that by you know you know you know you're not going to be able to do anything that's going to harm a human. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4381.0s)]
*  I mean that sounds pretty fundamental but it sounds like it's the AI layer. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4393.0s)]
*  Yeah there's certainly a select layer of AI that's going to be used to do that. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4397.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's certainly a select number of really important do not override read-only instructions that are going to be used to do that. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4402.0s)]
*  by not taking action causes human to be harmed. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4412.0s)]
*  but it sounds like that's the AI layer. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4417.84s)]
*  Yeah there's certainly a select number of really important do not override read-only [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4423.0s)]
*  instructions that need to live on the robot that can never be altered that's like for sure. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4431.0s)]
*  Do you imagine a figure, I mean, so one of the biggest advantages of having a robotic workforce is that they can all learn, when one robot learns a task, they all know the task. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4437.0s)]
*  And that requires sort of a, you know, sort of central control. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4449.0s)]
*  Is that going to be, you know, is that like one central control for a BMW plant or is that figure on a global level where there's a sort of mission control that is watching all robots and learning from them? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4456.0s)]
*  Yeah, you, sorry, for us, we would want robots as a fleet doing continuous learning and continuous training on that data set. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4468.0s)]
*  So it'll be a situation where we have millions, if not billions of robots on the planet, hopefully someday, that are all continuously learning as a group. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4481.0s)]
*  We're doing, we're doing offline training on that. And then the robots are basically getting smarter collectively. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4491.0s)]
*  It's like as a collective intelligence. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4496.0s)]
*  That's for sure what's happening in the direction we're heading towards. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4499.0s)]
*  You want, what's so powerful about this is like humans, you know, like my kids, like they learn how to walk. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4504.0s)]
*  They learn how to walk. They're mostly failing, like learning not like what not to do in some ways. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4511.0s)]
*  They learn new things. That takes a lot of time. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4516.0s)]
*  Once we know things like really well, we really don't forget, rarely do we forget, you know, how to walk or like certain things. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4520.0s)]
*  And that's happened throughout history, but most of the time we really don't forget. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4526.0s)]
*  So for robots, one of the biggest advantages we have is once one robot learns a certain task, every robot in the fleet will know this. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4530.0s)]
*  And so it'll be very exponential in terms of like the amount of new, almost like the matrix. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4539.0s)]
*  Like we will plug, like what we'll teach, robots will learn through like human demonstrations and through reasoning, like how to do something. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4546.0s)]
*  And once it's been able to demonstrate that several times and we've been able to, you know, like close the loop on that, like, okay, that's worked really well. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4555.0s)]
*  That's a reward system. Every robot in the fleet will know this. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4564.0s)]
*  That's why I think, you know, future surgeons will best be done, surgery will best be done by robots, you know, where when robot is seen, millions of different surgeries and can be the best and reliable surgeon out there. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4568.0s)]
*  Can we wrap up a conversation, just talk a little about jobs? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4583.0s)]
*  Because I have to imagine that that people are still fearful about robots taking their jobs. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4586.0s)]
*  We have like really good feedback so far. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4593.0s)]
*  You know, our goal is to really be able to do a lot of the jobs that are not desirable by humans. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4601.0s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned earlier in this podcast, we had like 8 million US jobs that people just don't want to do. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4609.0s)]
*  Like we want to do those jobs and we want to do the things right now that like that are potentially harmful and dangerous for humans to do. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4614.0s)]
*  And a lot of those jobs have like very high unemployment rates, very high, like very low retention, like really high, like low retention rates. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4624.0s)]
*  And we want to start trying to do those and trying to help automate. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4634.0s)]
*  And, you know, like we've been doing that as a world for like several centuries. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4640.0s)]
*  Like my my family was farmers, right? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4644.0s)]
*  At some point we had half the world was farmers. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4647.0s)]
*  I grew up on a farm. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4649.0s)]
*  Like 80 percent of the world was farmers. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4650.0s)]
*  Yeah, like everybody was farming. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4652.0s)]
*  And now, you know, like, well, not very many. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4654.0s)]
*  So like, you know, I grew up on a farm like that's like, you know, nobody's mad that we're all not farming. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4657.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4665.0s)]
*  Like, I'm like, you know, I'm not out there being like 80 percent of everybody should be farming right now. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4666.0s)]
*  Like that wouldn't be great, right? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4670.0s)]
*  For all like plowing fields and harvesting corn and soybeans. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4672.0s)]
*  Like that's not that I don't think that would have been productive state for humanity in 2024. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4677.0s)]
*  Do you remember when at the Fukushima nuclear reaction reactor and then DARPA had the DARPA robotics challenge? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4682.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen those videos where the robot was just, you know, laughably capable of opening a door or climbing steps? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4691.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the is it is the Defense Department and the government a client or near client? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4701.0s)]
*  How do you feel about about plugging into that world? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4711.0s)]
*  Yeah, we won't do anything defense related at all. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4714.0s)]
*  It's like in our manifesto online. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4720.0s)]
*  We we think the civilian like market is just orders of magnitude bigger than defense. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4721.0s)]
*  And it's not in our interest to like build a war machine of any kind, even non-kinetic war machine. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4729.0s)]
*  So we won't even have conversations. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4734.0s)]
*  We won't take phone calls with anybody in this area. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4737.0s)]
*  How do you feel about civil police and security right now? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4741.0s)]
*  No, like we're not touching stuff. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4747.0s)]
*  We don't want to give any we don't want to give any requirements that are needed to have the robot produce harm. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4749.0s)]
*  I respect that. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4756.0s)]
*  You know, to like any humans like our goal is our goal is to do work like we want to do work. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4759.0s)]
*  We think that freeze like we think it significantly helps the economy and helps lower goods and service prices and do good work for the world. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4763.0s)]
*  And I think it's much needed. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4775.0s)]
*  Like I think it's like we're putting all our eggs in that basket right now. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4776.0s)]
*  What industries do you see next? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4781.0s)]
*  I mean, you basically have I mean, it's every industry, but where do you think you want to play? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4783.0s)]
*  I mean, you're probably getting a ton of solicitations. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4788.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have like taking it a step at a time. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4791.0s)]
*  I mean, these companies are big. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4793.0s)]
*  I mean, we like these companies we're talking to like are massive. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4795.0s)]
*  We could ship thousands of robots in these groups. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4797.0s)]
*  So, you know, for us, we'd rather work with only a couple of groups right now and do that really well than like opening up to, you know, hundreds of groups at the moment. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4799.0s)]
*  But at some point in the coming years, we'll sell to anybody. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4809.0s)]
*  And we're starting our production line next year. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4813.0s)]
*  So we'll start with a few as we, you know, have like engineering really close with those customers and making sure that the product really works well. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4819.0s)]
*  There'll be like a bunch of bugs and process improvements we need to make to make those like a well oiled machine for the market. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4828.0s)]
*  We want to do those with those customers now. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4835.0s)]
*  And, you know, as we get to some level of product maturity, we'll branch out to more and more customers. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4837.0s)]
*  And something that we're going to spend more and more time on is also like robots in the home. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4843.0s)]
*  And when can I own a robot in my home? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4847.0s)]
*  Because I'd like to put my order in now. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4850.0s)]
*  Every six months that goes by, I go to a couple of folks here and I say the timeline for us getting home is accelerating. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4852.0s)]
*  And it one of the things that will be really helpful for us getting to the workforce, it'll really help us get system reliability up, safety up, and the cost down and volumes up for manufacturing. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4860.0s)]
*  It'll really help us in the home because you really want like you'll probably have like an order of magnitude pricing collapse going into the home from the workforce. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4874.0s)]
*  Sure. And you really need economies of scale to get there. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4883.0s)]
*  And you really need a safety certified system in the home. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4886.0s)]
*  So like you need a really safe product in the home. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4889.0s)]
*  So we we are using the workforce in a lot of ways to boost drop that vision for us. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4892.0s)]
*  And but I think from a performance perspective, I think I think we'll start doing early work in the home and you know and then like you know, I think the home for us is an area where I think it's accelerating in my mind every every six months that we gave it. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4900.0s)]
*  Give me a guess. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4916.0s)]
*  Is it three years, five years, eight years? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4917.0s)]
*  I would say within the next three years, we'll definitely have robots piling in homes. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4920.0s)]
*  Nice. Okay. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4924.0s)]
*  I want to volunteer early on. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4925.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll pay. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4926.0s)]
*  Probably start with some lock homes here in our facilities and start, you know, getting the bugs worked out understanding how to the system architectures all work. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4928.0s)]
*  But I'm interested in seeing what problems we face that we're not prepared for that are limiting our ability to get in the home long term as well. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4936.0s)]
*  Amazing. So last question for you, Brett. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4944.0s)]
*  Manufacturing. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4948.0s)]
*  You scaling up your building a manufacturing plant for figure. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4950.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're actually starting our production line next year. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4953.0s)]
*  We're going to do that. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4957.0s)]
*  We're gonna do it here in California, like close to engineering. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4959.0s)]
*  So we really work out the kinks on like more of a traditional like kind of pilot manufacturing line or production line. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4961.0s)]
*  And and then from there, we'll start announcing our intentions for like we're like, like high rate manufacturing will look. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4967.0s)]
*  But our production line is being we're starting to design it as we speak. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4973.0s)]
*  We'll have robots coming off the production line next year. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4978.0s)]
*  And so you're scaling it for what kind of volume you think? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4981.0s)]
*  We'll start with hundreds of robots and then thousands like we really want to get the pro. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4986.0s)]
*  What's more important for us than just like having like, you know, here's three thousand five four thousand robots out is getting the process really dialed in for how to do that. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4991.0s)]
*  And then also making sure those robots that we're producing are working really well. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=4999.0s)]
*  There's a situation where anybody easily can get into where we have like too many robots that don't work well. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5004.0s)]
*  And you're basically in this recursive loop, fixing them, always having them down. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5010.0s)]
*  Like volume doesn't really help. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5014.0s)]
*  So you really need the system reliability to be at a certain point in the production, like the performance of those robots. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5015.0s)]
*  Then into the end of the use cases to be pretty high. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5023.0s)]
*  I do not feel like building thousands of robots is it seems super tractable to go do now building like hundreds of thousands of robots is a different story than building millions is a different story. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5026.0s)]
*  But building like two thousand five thousand ten thousand robots is just at this point, you know, building we're building one a week. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5037.0s)]
*  So it might seem, you know, and then we'll start building like one a day and then we'll start building multiples a day here next 12 months. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5044.0s)]
*  So like I think but it seems like pretty straightforward path. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5050.0s)]
*  I mean, we make cell phones almost by hand in the world to make a few billion a year. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5056.0s)]
*  Like this is more complex than a cell phone, but far less complex than a car. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5059.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I feel like the path to making thousands in the near term is just not super difficult. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5064.0s)]
*  What's the difficult part is making those thousands to a point where they're really useful and really work. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5071.0s)]
*  That's like that's the name of the game for me. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5076.0s)]
*  Brett Adcock, I'm a huge fan of what you built and excited for for for figure twos roll out into the world. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5078.0s)]
*  And actually what I saw with figure three is absolutely gorgeous. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5087.0s)]
*  So excited for that as well. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5091.0s)]
*  Thank you for all the hard work you're doing. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5093.0s)]
*  And, you know, I do think this is a way of uplifting humanity and creating an age of abundance. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5095.0s)]
*  So much appreciate it. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5101.0s)]
*  Let's do it, Peter. See you. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5102.0s)]
*  See you, pal. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_f2gOWV2Es&t=5104.0s)]
