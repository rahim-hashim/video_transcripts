# Ex-Neuralink Founder: AI Enhanced Bodies Are Nearly Here w/ Max Hodak | EP #171
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8)
*  Giving sight to the blind is a very biblical statement. Literally. Literally. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. Max Hodak. Max Hodak. From rewriting biology to brain computer interfaces. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=6.36s)]
*  Pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human. It's crazy how like biblical [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=12.48s)]
*  miracles eventually come to our companies. So I love entrepreneurs who've got this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=16.8s)]
*  incredible moonshot but also have a real business at the same time. I think we are [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=20.48s)]
*  incredibly close to super exciting breakthroughs but it has to be supported [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=24.92s)]
*  by something that can fund it sustainably. Let's establish how fast our [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=29.08s)]
*  brain is actually inputting, outputting information. So spoken language is about [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  40 bits per second. Our attention processes the world at about 10 bits per [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=37.16s)]
*  second. Penetrating cortical electrodes like Neuralink, like BrainGate, like [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=41.56s)]
*  others have been able to get five to seven bits per second. What is a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=45.56s)]
*  possible future here? All I know is that these devices are technically capable to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  build and I have no idea what it will feel like but we're gonna find out. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=54.12s)]
*  Now that's the moonshot ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=59.08s)]
*  Super pumped about what you have been building. You know we're gonna talk about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=69.4s)]
*  two things. One a product you have today which is a revenue engine. So I love [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=74.6s)]
*  entrepreneurs who've got this incredible moonshot, right? Something that's big and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=79.88s)]
*  bold but also have a real business at the same time on the path there. That's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=84.68s)]
*  extraordinarily unique and critically important when you're actually building a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  business and you've done both. So before we jump into the BCI of it all, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=94.68s)]
*  would you talk about Prima? Yeah, first of all thank you for having me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=104.2s)]
*  Pleasure. It's really cool to be here and I don't want to undersell the near-term [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=108.04s)]
*  product which is still a huge deal. So we have the world's first retinal [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=111.8s)]
*  prosthesis that really works. So there's a couple slides here. There's three layers [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=117.8s)]
*  of cells in the eye that transmit vision from light coming in to a signal going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  into the brain for patients that have lost the rods and cones in the back of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=127.8s)]
*  their eyes. So their retina is intact, their brain can see but the eyes no longer [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=131.8s)]
*  light sensitive. And these are typically what type of diseases? This is specifically [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=135.32s)]
*  macular degeneration, especially age-related macular degeneration. Anybody know anybody [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=138.12s)]
*  with macular degeneration here in the room? A lot, right? It's pretty prevalent. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=140.84s)]
*  And retinitis pigmentosa. My mom's dad had retinitis pigmentosa so I grew up [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=144.76s)]
*  around blindness. So we have a chip that can be implanted in the back of the eye. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=148.84s)]
*  So each one of these little honeycomb structures is essentially a solar cell. So the patient [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=153.4s)]
*  puts on glasses that has a laser projector that strikes the implant in the back of the eye [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=158.68s)]
*  to excite the remaining cells in the retina to get the visual signal into the optic nerve at the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=163.32s)]
*  first possible opportunity beyond the dead photoreceptors. It's a super simple one-hour [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=169.72s)]
*  outpatient procedure. The surgeon makes a little blub under the retina, places the chip, and then [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=176.92s)]
*  the patient goes home and recovers in a couple days can put on these glasses. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=183.96s)]
*  And we finished a clinical trial last summer. 38 patients in Europe in that trial. There's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=188.44s)]
*  about 50 people around the world that have had it so far. It's the first time in the history of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=193.4s)]
*  the world as far as we know that these blind patients have been able to read again. And so [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=197.56s)]
*  we're super, super excited about this. It's interesting because giving sight to the blind [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=201.88s)]
*  is a very biblical statement. Literally. Literally. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=214.04s)]
*  Yeah. And so I definitely, I mean, I'm very excited about the BCI technology that we have coming. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=217.16s)]
*  I think one of the things that I've learned is the end state is often obvious. Ray Kurzweil was [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=223.4s)]
*  in the 90s, he was saying, oh, we would get here. The end state can be inferred. The question is, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=229.64s)]
*  how do you get there? And the kinds of investment that it's going to take to make these technologies [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=234.2s)]
*  work. But I definitely don't want to undersell the retinal prosthesis. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Primo for a second. If you were going to describe the state of the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=242.6s)]
*  technology in humans working ready to sell. So I have to be very careful with what I say on that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=248.52s)]
*  piece. It's not approved yet, but yeah, we're planning to submit for marketing approval [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=257.32s)]
*  in Europe in the next month. We're discussing with the FDA on what exactly additionally they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=261.16s)]
*  need to see, but we're hoping to have this on market in definitely the EU and hopefully the U.S. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=266.52s)]
*  early next year. Amazing. Amazing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  That's a big product. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=274.92s)]
*  How big is that market, that potential total market? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=276.52s)]
*  It's many billions of dollars a year. There's very strong reimbursement precedents at a couple [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  hundred thousand dollars, probably around $200,000 a patient. In the U.S., the payer that matters [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=287.32s)]
*  here is Medicare because all of these patients are over 65. In Europe, there's reimbursement [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=292.12s)]
*  precedents around $150,000 a patient. There's tens of thousands of patients that this is directly [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=297.08s)]
*  relevant for. The whole population is probably about 250,000. If you can get to even reach [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=303.16s)]
*  two or three thousand patients a year, this is a half a billion dollars, three quarters of a billion. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=308.36s)]
*  I love it when an entrepreneur describes their on-base single as a billion dollar opportunity. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=312.92s)]
*  Yeah, but when you look at AI, what are the companies that get to invest the most sustainably? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=319.72s)]
*  It's the profitable tech companies. Having to go back to the well every 18 months is a huge strategic [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  disadvantage. I think there's been a ton of capital and excitement, enthusiasm that's flown [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=331.96s)]
*  into BCI. What this base really needs is a company making $100 million or more a year. Until that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=335.64s)]
*  happens, there will always be a risk of winter. I think we are incredibly close to super exciting [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  breakthroughs, but it has to be supported by something that can fund it sustainably. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=348.52s)]
*  I think most of you know that the news media is delivering negative news to us all the time [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=351.56s)]
*  because we pay 10 times more attention to negative news than positive news. For me, the only news [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=355.56s)]
*  worthwhile that's true and impacting humanity is the news of science and technology. That's what [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=361.72s)]
*  I pay attention to. Every week, I put out two blogs, one on AI and exponential tech and one [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=368.12s)]
*  on longevity. If this is of interest to you and it's available totally for free, please join me. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  Subscribe at diamagnus.com slash subscribe. That's diamagnus.com slash subscribe. All right, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  let's go back to the episode. You've acquired the manufacturing and built up the manufacturing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=385.72s)]
*  capacity for this, yes? We've done two acquisitions, including one as a captive [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=390.6s)]
*  MEMS fab in North Carolina. The vertical integration is essential. I absolutely received [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=394.6s)]
*  the gospel of vertical integration from my former co-founder and prior boss. We routinely [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=400.36s)]
*  void the warranty on million dollar fab tools to place atoms exactly where we want them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=407.0s)]
*  Being able to do that and also go from design change to surgery in a couple of weeks [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=412.6s)]
*  is absolutely enabling at being able to innovate. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=417.8s)]
*  Fantastic. Hold that in your mind as a company that is solving something of extraordinary [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  difficulty where the tech is up and operational, regulatory approvals coming very shortly, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=428.04s)]
*  revenues following very shortly thereafter. I think that's an extraordinary accomplishment [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=433.32000000000005s)]
*  on its own. Now, let's move to the Grand Slam home run potential. I remember when [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  when I was talking to Ray Kurzweil about his predictions, and again, if you Google his [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=445.79999999999995s)]
*  predictions, he's got like an 86% accuracy if you look on Wikipedia. One of his predictions [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=451.4s)]
*  was high bandwidth BCI by the early 2030s, like 2033. I was like, Ray, this one, I don't see it [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  happening in that timeframe. You're wrong about this one. Then I met Max and I was like, okay, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=465.08s)]
*  Ray, you're right again. So, Max, just for a moment, I won't linger on it, but you were [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=470.52s)]
*  the co-founder and president of Neuralink. How long were you there for? About four and a half [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=479.08s)]
*  years. Four and a half years. Okay. I wouldn't say this, but I mean, he wouldn't say this, but you [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=483.47999999999996s)]
*  know, it's actually I won't just I won't even say it. All right. You broke away and founded [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=488.12s)]
*  science. You had a unique idea, which I think is extraordinary. Describe the problem with all the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=497.56s)]
*  current neural implants. So you've got external BCI, which is looking at EEGs. You've got something [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=506.92s)]
*  under the skull, above the dura. Then you have sort of wires placed in the upper parts of the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=516.04s)]
*  neocortex and you have deep brain stimulation. All those are different types, but let's talk about [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=524.84s)]
*  products like a Neuralink and others. What's the challenge they have? Yeah. So there's many, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=531.4000000000001s)]
*  many different ways to try to record and drive activity of neurons throughout the brain. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=536.2s)]
*  Neuroscience as a field has been trying to do this for the last hundred, almost 150 years. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=542.84s)]
*  The first thing I want to say is that BCI is a field, not a product. There are many different [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=549.6400000000001s)]
*  products that will use many different modalities for different things. But there do seem to be [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=553.32s)]
*  very serious fundamental physics limitations to the types of like the resolution and the accuracy [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=559.08s)]
*  that you can get with purely non-invasive devices. So then once you start thinking about putting [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  something below the skull, the main approaches that are used today are putting just wires into [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=572.36s)]
*  the brain. The idea there is very simple. Neurons communicate, they have these electrical fields [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  that they generate. And so if you put an electrode into the brain, you can detect this. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=581.8s)]
*  There's other groups that are using, they're genetically modifying neurons in the brain to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=586.52s)]
*  make them light sensitive or make them emit light. And then there's other groups that are [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=592.04s)]
*  interested in using ultrasound. The problems with ultrasound and optical methods, optogenetics, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=595.4799999999999s)]
*  is these really require genetically modifying neurons throughout the brain. And so doing this [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=601.4799999999999s)]
*  in an adult human is really pretty tricky. That seems like a non-starter for many cases. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=605.24s)]
*  You're irreversibly modifying these neurons in the brain of adult humans using these viral [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=610.44s)]
*  vectors and they don't get perfectly distributed. And even then there's still really severe limits [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=615.6400000000001s)]
*  to the depth that you can image or the resolution that you can get. Now the problem with placing [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=619.8800000000001s)]
*  wires into the brain, which allow you to get single neurons, is that we are used to these [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=625.6400000000001s)]
*  cartoons of neurons floating in space where you can like place electrodes safely between them. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=632.2800000000001s)]
*  But the reality is that there's no space in the brain. The brain is this wet, warm, squished [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=637.16s)]
*  thing. And no matter how small or how flexible your device is, it might look like it's a tiny [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=641.4s)]
*  fraction of a human hair floating off a finger. Every time you place one of these into the brain, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=647.24s)]
*  you destroy thousands of cells. So that's your typical, that blue line is your typical thickness [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=651.88s)]
*  of a... Yeah, of an electrode. Some electrode. And now if you have a serious spinal cord injury, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  destroying 50,000 cells in cortex to get five bits per second recording from 500 neurons might [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  be totally indicated. But it does mean that you can't scale up this approach to millions of cells. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=669.8000000000001s)]
*  And that is really what you want in order to get these next generation applications. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=674.6800000000001s)]
*  So I think about like, what is an idealized neural interface? I've been thinking about this [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=678.84s)]
*  question really since I've been in fifth grade. And can I, can I set a piece of context for folks? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  I love that since I've been in fifth grade. You heard that, right? How, in terms of bits per [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=688.76s)]
*  second, in terms of baud rate, how would you describe the human brain interface on communications, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=696.28s)]
*  on speech and so on? Let's establish how fast our brain is actually inputting, outputting information. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=703.64s)]
*  So there's two ways to answer this question. So the figure of merit for any brain computer [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=709.64s)]
*  interface is a bandwidth in bits per second. And so there's, this is another way to look at [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=713.24s)]
*  the different approaches. There's groups that are placing stents with electrodes into blood vessels. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=717.96s)]
*  There's something very elegant about getting into the brain through the body's natural road system. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=723.08s)]
*  But because of where that limits you and how far you are from the cells, those only get half a bit [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=726.9200000000001s)]
*  per second. Penetrating cortical electrodes like Neuralink, like BrainGate, like others, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  have been able to get five to seven bits per second. So spoken language is about 40 bits per [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=736.84s)]
*  second. Okay, so just to hear that, right? 40 bits per second is when you and I are speaking, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=742.52s)]
*  right? So Neuralink is probably getting how much you think? I think that what's been published is [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=748.4399999999999s)]
*  about seven bits per second. Seven bits per second. Yeah. And this is, that's an interesting result [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=752.84s)]
*  because if you take all the, like many different human languages, some are spoken more quickly and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=757.88s)]
*  convey less information per token. Some are spoken more slowly and convey more information per token. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=762.28s)]
*  But if you plot these, they all come out to about 40 bits per second. There's also a lot of neuroscience [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=766.6s)]
*  evidence that our attention processes the world at about 10 bits per second. So the amount of [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=772.44s)]
*  information that you can perceive and remember is that there's kind of this evolved cognitive [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=779.24s)]
*  bottleneck about 10 bits per second. And so when I think about high bandwidth BCIs, I don't think [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  in terms of communicating faster. I think that you're not going to make it so you can just convey [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=788.2800000000001s)]
*  thoughts more quickly, but it might be possible. Like getting information into the brain is very [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=793.72s)]
*  straightforward, is very easy. You can see, you can hear, you can feel. These are much, much more [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=799.48s)]
*  than 40 bits per second, the bandwidth of a vision, but you can't get these out of the brain. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=804.9200000000001s)]
*  For everything that you can perceive, you can imagine, but you can't get imagery out of the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=811.5600000000001s)]
*  brain or audio out of the brain. And that might be possible. Or we think about adding new cortical [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=815.72s)]
*  areas in the sense that even if you're still communicating at 40 bits per second in terms of [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=819.96s)]
*  number of tokens, can you make those much smarter? Can you have skills or knowledge or memory [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=825.48s)]
*  that you can get into the brain? Like a Chinese character versus a letter of an alphabet. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=832.36s)]
*  I just want you to get those numbers because maybe you think you communicate in megabits [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=839.96s)]
*  or gigabits like your computer does. We're at 40 bits. 40 bits. So when I think about what is the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=844.04s)]
*  idealized brain computer interface, the one that would really solve a lot of these problems, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=850.52s)]
*  the thing I think of if you've seen the Avatar movies is this thing. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=855.88s)]
*  It's a big externalized cranial nerve. So all of the information that flows in or out of the brain [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=860.84s)]
*  goes through a relatively small number of wires. There are 12 cranial nerves. The optic nerve is [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=865.72s)]
*  nerve two. The vestibular cochlear nerve that carries hearing and balance is nerve eight. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=869.96s)]
*  Then you've got 31 spinal nerves that connect out to the muscles. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=874.6800000000001s)]
*  Bringing back memories from medical school. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=877.24s)]
*  Yeah. And so when we think about our retinal prosthesis, what we really see is a nerve two [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=878.9200000000001s)]
*  interface. But the question is could you grow a 13th cranial nerve that has interhemispheric [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=883.24s)]
*  class bandwidth? The bandwidth that connects the two hemispheres, this fiber bundle called the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=890.52s)]
*  corpus callosum. Could you have a branch of that that comes out and gives you a USB cable at the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=895.8s)]
*  end? And so this was an idea that I had back in college, but really was beyond all of our [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=900.04s)]
*  collective ability to build at the time. But the idea that we had is what if we, instead of [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=908.36s)]
*  placing something into the brain, we load an electronic device with heavily engineered neurons, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=913.4s)]
*  stem cell derived neurons, embed them in a hydrogel so that the cells don't go anywhere, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=918.6s)]
*  and then engraft the wet side of this into the brain. So there's no sterile injury to the brain. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=923.32s)]
*  We don't place any electrical or mechanical parts. The only thing that penetrates into the brain [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=928.04s)]
*  are the biological processes of these graft cells. But at the far end, you get chemical synapses. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  And so we can activate these cells optically to fire them selectively. They grow both axons and [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=938.76s)]
*  dendrites, so we can get input and output, and we can record from them electrically. So the optical [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=945.4s)]
*  stem and electrical record allows us to avoid crosstalks. We can drive all of them at once. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=950.92s)]
*  And this is a cool device because you can easily make a 100,000 electrode device because you're [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=956.6800000000001s)]
*  much closer to the cells, so you can have much tighter electrode pitch. You can load that with [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=962.2s)]
*  a million neurons, and when that grows in, you'll get a billion synapses throughout huge areas of [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=966.2s)]
*  cortex. Really critically important here. So if you look at BrainGate, Neuralink, how many total [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=970.36s)]
*  electrodes are they placing? So BrainGate places 100. Neuralink so far has placed 1,000. Okay, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=975.1600000000001s)]
*  we're talking about 100,000 or millions of these. And the other thing that's beautiful is that these [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=979.8000000000001s)]
*  neural growths, these axons and dendrites, when they grow into the brain, because they're native [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=986.84s)]
*  to the brain, they're not disrupting the tissue. They're pushing it aside. Yeah. So if you were to [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=994.2s)]
*  do this for real, you would see an image that looks like this. This is a mouse brain. You can see at [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=999.72s)]
*  the top, there's a bolus of cells where the device was removed for suction. So this is what you did. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1004.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. This is us. It's functional in a mouse. And so the graft cells that we've added are [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1008.9200000000001s)]
*  labeled in green. The host neurons of the mouse are in blue. And the thing, if we look carefully, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1016.2s)]
*  you can see all these little green dots really throughout it. And so what we've seen is that [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1022.04s)]
*  when we engraft these devices, they grow in and they wire up very promiscuously. They form [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1026.36s)]
*  connections everywhere. And then after about four to six weeks, they start undergoing an activity [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1031.48s)]
*  dependent pruning. And so the really interesting possibility there is that how they wire up is not [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1035.56s)]
*  necessarily genetically defined. It can be informationally defined based on the types [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  of activity that you're getting in the device. And then in addition to growing down and wiring [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1045.72s)]
*  up throughout cortex, the first layer on the surface of the brain, cortical layer one, is a [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1051.72s)]
*  white matter track. It's these long projection. It's like this highway between different areas [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1056.44s)]
*  of the brain. And we often see in the devices that we'll get a fiber bundle that will follow [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1060.28s)]
*  that for millimeters. The mouse brain is very small. But we see these things project all the [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1064.92s)]
*  way through to subcortical structures. And where these neurons and dendrites grow and they wire [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1069.16s)]
*  and then they connect and where they don't, they die off. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1077.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they'll retract. I mean, so the cells mostly don't die, but they'll retract the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1082.1200000000001s)]
*  axon growth cones and the dendritic arbors. Yeah. Everybody, I hope you're enjoying this episode. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1086.04s)]
*  Earlier this year, I was joined on stage at the 2025 Abundance Summit by a rock star group of [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1091.24s)]
*  entrepreneurs, CEOs, investors focused on the vision and future for AGI, humanoid robotics, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1097.5600000000002s)]
*  longevity, blockchain, basically the next trillion dollar opportunities. If you weren't at the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1104.92s)]
*  Abundance Summit, it's not too late. You can watch the entire Abundance Summit online by going to [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1109.8000000000002s)]
*  exponentialmastery.com. That's exponentialmastery.com. So this is, we have these, this is the kind of [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1115.72s)]
*  looking at one of the chips. There's these cells loaded in these trenches. And here, this is a Z [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1123.4s)]
*  stack. So each frame is starting at the surface and it's looking deeper and deeper into the brain. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1130.3600000000001s)]
*  You can see the circles of the cell bodies on the surface. All of the green that we see are the [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1134.84s)]
*  graft neurons, but you can see the shadows of the blood vessels in these later layers. And so this [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1140.1999999999998s)]
*  is super cool because when you place an electrode into the brain, you always get bleeding. And if [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1145.56s)]
*  you hit a descending blood vessel, you could stroke out a whole mini column. Here, these grow in around [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1150.52s)]
*  the blood vessels, the capillary is remodeled around it. And so this is like a really, it's a [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1156.12s)]
*  perfectly biocompatible way to get chemical synapses. And we see these things, even where [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1160.92s)]
*  it looks like it's fallen off, you see that the processes of these cells growing in. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1167.4s)]
*  You know, the theme of this event, this year's summit is convergence. What technologies have to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1174.04s)]
*  converge here to make this possible? A lot of this was enabled by recent advances in cell [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1179.88s)]
*  engineering. So one of the things that we have to do is hide the graft cells from the immune system. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1185.56s)]
*  We want to be, we do a lot of editing to these cells. If we were to do this on a per patient [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1191.24s)]
*  basis, because the immune system would have to recognize them, this would take over a year and [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1196.12s)]
*  be prohibitively expensive. There's been a lot of advancement recently making what we call [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1200.36s)]
*  hypoimmunogenic stem cells, the whole CRISPR toolbox and a lot of other, there's technologies [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1207.72s)]
*  now like small molecule trigger kill switches. So we can make it that if you take a vitamin, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1214.68s)]
*  the graft cells will die. So you can keep an eye on them. If once you've hidden them from the immune [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1219.5600000000002s)]
*  system, you kind of want that built in. When these go into human cities, it'll be by far the most [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1223.16s)]
*  heavily edited cell therapy to reach people. And I've seen material sciences. And then materials. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1227.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's materials like silicon carbide, big improvements on the materials. There's, we talk [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1233.24s)]
*  it in the BCI field, we talk about the smartphone dividend. We rely heavily on the same tech stack [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1239.4s)]
*  that smartphones and wearables build on. But Apple and Samsung and others have poured over [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1244.44s)]
*  $100 billion onto that. Our field is too small to afford that today. But we get to build on that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1249.4s)]
*  That has really been enabling and has really advanced a lot in the last few years. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1255.0s)]
*  Talk to me about where, when this enters primates and potentially humans. And when can I get mine? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1260.2s)]
*  Yeah, so we currently have some primates getting trained up on behavior. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1266.6000000000001s)]
*  So you're training them in advance? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1274.04s)]
*  Yeah, we're training them in advance. We also need to figure out things like how well can they reason, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1275.88s)]
*  which actually hasn't been that well studied in many cases. We're hoping to do the first [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1279.96s)]
*  primate and grafts in a few months later. So going into primates in a couple months, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1285.4s)]
*  which is amazing. I mean, once you're operational in primates, you're effectively, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1290.76s)]
*  other than regulatory prohibitions, functional and human. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1298.2s)]
*  Yeah, we'll be able to prove the neuroscience that is like the big questions for humans in primates. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1302.28s)]
*  And the first humans to get this will almost certainly be for stroke. And if you'd asked me [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1307.64s)]
*  this three weeks ago, I would have said I thought that it would be four or five years before the [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1313.0s)]
*  first human will get it. I actually think this is now going to be much faster. I think there's, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1316.1200000000001s)]
*  there might be a collaboration that allows us to go to humans a lot faster than I'd realized. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1320.76s)]
*  And again, that'll be almost certainly for stroke. And the primates are actually a pretty good model [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1324.84s)]
*  of human stroke patients because a human that's lost a cortical area can be modeled by a monkey [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1330.4399999999998s)]
*  that never had it in the first place. And if you can restore that capability, then there's an argument [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1335.56s)]
*  that you'll be able to do it in humans. And the other thing I'll say is from the beyond stroke [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1339.3999999999999s)]
*  rehabilitation or adding these capabilities to humans, when we think about scaling this up, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1345.1599999999999s)]
*  I see this as a way to redraw the borders around the brain. Your head has two hemispheres. These [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1350.12s)]
*  are connected by a fiber bundle called the corpus callosum that gives you the experience of one [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1357.4799999999998s)]
*  agent in the head. But really you've got two sub-brains that are mostly independent. And [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1361.56s)]
*  people have, like a long time ago, they don't do this so much anymore. They used to cut the corpus [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1367.32s)]
*  callosum disconnection in epilepsy patients to prevent a seizure from spreading across the [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1372.36s)]
*  hemispheres. And so you know that if you cut that, you really get something that looks like two agents [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1378.04s)]
*  in one head. And there's a natural example of going the other way. There's a pair of twins in Canada, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1382.28s)]
*  the Hogan twins, that have one head with four hemispheres. And they can share meaningful [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1388.12s)]
*  elements of their consciousness. And there's elements of task transfer between them. And so [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1393.32s)]
*  I think a way to conceptualize this is imagine if this was a tech product. And that might be coming [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1398.44s)]
*  a lot sooner. So like we know this must be possible because nature has done it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1404.04s)]
*  And hoping to have this, I mean, Lee and humans, hopefully pretty soon. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1409.1599999999999s)]
*  Which is pretty extraordinary. Let's give it up for that, huh? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1415.1599999999999s)]
*  Max, I want to dive a little bit further about what will this mean? So this becomes enabled [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1420.84s)]
*  other than me being able to think in Google or sort of watch a 4K video with my eyes closed. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1429.48s)]
*  What does this actually mean in terms of increasing intelligence connecting [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1438.28s)]
*  to AI? What is a possible future here? Yeah, I mean, I, for a lot of my life, I always felt [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1442.12s)]
*  like I could see the future. And I've got this event horizon somewhere between 2030 and 2035 now [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1448.84s)]
*  that is just impossible to see past. The AGI and ASI are definitely happening. And I think that [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1455.4s)]
*  this is, I mean, everybody knows about it now, but it is still, there's basically no way to [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1463.48s)]
*  overrate the impact of that. And this is the, is the merge the only way through? I don't know. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1469.56s)]
*  That was a conversation we had last year. Do we need to couple? By the way, I should have said, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1481.3999999999999s)]
*  please get your questions ready. I'm going to be bringing Max still on stage and bringing Mo out. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1486.28s)]
*  So we're going to be going to your questions next. So please dive in here. I mean, but if, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1491.56s)]
*  if we do merge, you've talked about the idea of pre-training in some ways of these, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1497.72s)]
*  these bio hybrids. Can you speak to that a little bit? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1504.28s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think neural interconnects like brain to brain connections are a really interesting [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1506.92s)]
*  technology, both for merging with AI. But now that I think transformers are a pretty good [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1514.04s)]
*  explanation for cortex, but to get real agency in a way that is interesting or dangerous, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1521.8000000000002s)]
*  you need, you need something else to add onto that. And so there's people have these loops [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1527.8000000000002s)]
*  that are prompted and, but that, that is still coming from the human. And, and so it might be [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1531.96s)]
*  that the agency remains with the humans, but these technologies are so powerful, so adaptive [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1537.48s)]
*  that people who participate in this have a huge advantage. And this is a thing that societies need [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1542.5200000000002s)]
*  to need to think about. I also see it as a longevity technology. If you can get, I think, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1547.5600000000002s)]
*  like, how do you let someone into your head is a tricky question. I think that the first use case [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1553.64s)]
*  for this would probably be things like long married couples where one has a terminal disease [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1560.44s)]
*  for the last year, you can get like a brain to brain. So rather than merging with AI, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1565.64s)]
*  it's merging with your spouse or a close family member. So by the level of intimacy. Yeah. And, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1570.2s)]
*  and can you turn, and there, if like you're throughout your life, small groups of neurons [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1574.76s)]
*  are constantly dying. There's a smaller number that are being generated, but this is turning [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1580.2s)]
*  over. And so can you turn the death experience into basically a stroke that you recover from [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1583.96s)]
*  all communication is about creating correlations between brains, long relationships already store [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1589.0s)]
*  memories in each other's brains. Is there a threshold where you can get phenomenal [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1595.08s)]
*  binding across the interface where you really get one agent out? And then when you lose some [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1600.28s)]
*  group of neurons, that's not, you still get continuity of consciousness and continuity of [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1604.52s)]
*  experience through that transition. That I see that as an alternative path than the biological [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1609.56s)]
*  longevity companies, but feels a lot more like an engineering problem to me. I think it'll be [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1616.92s)]
*  possible on the, on the timescale of the next decade. And in that view, it's, you can merge [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1621.8000000000002s)]
*  with other people. You could merge with AI or you could have these super organisms that are [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1625.3200000000002s)]
*  composites of big groups. I call them a meta intelligence. When we're able to connect [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1629.88s)]
*  millions of people's, our thoughts or feelings and a level of intimacy and connection. I mean, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1634.68s)]
*  you are a collection of 40 trillion cells that you don't think of yourself as 40 trillion cells. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1639.5600000000002s)]
*  You think of myself, yourself as you imagine if millions or billions are connected through the [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1645.4s)]
*  cloud together and you become conscious on yet another level. Yeah. I mean, the really [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1653.24s)]
*  interesting question here where we're, we're still missing some physics, but I I'm increasingly [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1658.1200000000001s)]
*  confident we're going to get this in the next five years is what is the point where you go from [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1661.8000000000002s)]
*  having two conscious experiences into, into a single, like a, into a single experience, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1665.72s)]
*  or do you keep multiple attentional windows? I mean, this is tough to talk about without [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1672.36s)]
*  sounding like a lunatic. All I know is that these devices are technically capable to build. And I [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1675.3999999999999s)]
*  have no idea what it will feel like, but we're going to find out. All right. On that note, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9w-hIQQcm8&t=1680.28s)]
