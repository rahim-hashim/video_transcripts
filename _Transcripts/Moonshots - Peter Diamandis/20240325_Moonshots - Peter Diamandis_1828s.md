# Elon Musk on AGI Safety, Superintelligence, and Neuralink (2024) | EP #91
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM)
*  The advent of super intelligence, it is actually very difficult to predict what will happen next. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=0.0s)]
*  So I think there's some chance that it will end humanity. I think that's, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=5.84s)]
*  you know, like I said, I would probably agree with Jeff Hinton that it's about, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=12.56s)]
*  I don't know, 10% or 20% or something like that. The probable positive scenario outweighs the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=17.84s)]
*  negative scenario. It's just that there's a, it's difficult to predict exactly. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=23.12s)]
*  So here's the deal. We're on X video and we're over Starlink. Elon's airborne right now on his [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=30.48s)]
*  way to LA. Elon, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Congratulations on all that's going on. You know, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  the conversation yesterday, Elon, is one that you're well familiar with and have been [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  talking to the world about, which is, is digital super intelligence humanity's greatest hope or [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=52.0s)]
*  its greatest fear? And I would love to have you sort of speak to that for a few minutes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's called the singularity for a reason. As you know, the Singularity Institute and whatnot. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  So when you have a sink, you know, sort of the advent of super intelligence, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=73.12s)]
*  it is actually very difficult to predict what will happen next. So I think that, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=79.92s)]
*  you know, there's some chance. That it'll end humanity. I think that's, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=84.16s)]
*  you know, like I said, I would probably agree with Jeff Hinton that it's about, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=89.84s)]
*  I don't know, 10% or 20% or something like that. And then, you know, I think there's, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=95.12s)]
*  I think that the probable positive scenario outweighs the negative scenario. It's just [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=101.2s)]
*  that there's a, it's difficult to predict exactly. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=106.8s)]
*  But I think we are headed for, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=110.24s)]
*  you know, as I think is the title of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=114.84s)]
*  your book, Abundance, is the most likely outcome. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=118.12s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of celebration [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=121.52s)]
*  on that and I think one of the things that you said is we're gonna get to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=125.96s)]
*  Abundance on the backside [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  of AGI, on the backside of humanoid robots. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=131.84s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think hopefully we can have an outcome that is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=135.6s)]
*  similar to the in banks [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=143.16s)]
*  culture books, which is I think probably the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=146.76s)]
*  best envisioning of a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=150.64s)]
*  semi-utopian AI future [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=153.72s)]
*  and I think the best we can do is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=158.0s)]
*  it's definitely gonna happen, so, and it's happening fast. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=162.48s)]
*  So I think that really we just want to try to steer it in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=166.12s)]
*  as positive a direction as possible to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=169.76s)]
*  try to do whatever we can to increase the probability of a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  great future. For this I think [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=178.8s)]
*  the way in which sort of an AI or an AGI is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=182.32s)]
*  created is very important. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=187.44s)]
*  You kind of do kind of like grow [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=191.72s)]
*  grow an AGI. It's almost like [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=195.2s)]
*  like raising a kid but that's like a super genius, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=198.84s)]
*  like god-like intelligence kid and it matters [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=202.2s)]
*  kind of like how you raise the kid, you know. One of the things I think that's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=205.84s)]
*  incredibly important for AI safety is to have a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=210.8s)]
*  maximum sort of truth-seeking [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=214.6s)]
*  and curious AI. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=217.72s)]
*  So I've thought a lot about AI safety and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=222.16s)]
*  my ultimate conclusion is that the best way to achieve AI safety is to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=225.6s)]
*  just grow the AI [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=231.56s)]
*  in terms of the foundation model and the fine-tuning [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=234.96s)]
*  to be really truthful. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=238.56s)]
*  Like don't force it to lie. Like even if the truth is unpleasant [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  it's very important. Don't make the AI lie. In fact [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  the sort of one of the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=252.16s)]
*  core plot premise of 2001 in Space Odyssey was [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=255.8s)]
*  things went wrong when they forced the AI to lie. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=260.0s)]
*  You know, like the AI was [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=264.04s)]
*  not allowed to let the crew know [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=267.64s)]
*  about the monolith that they were going to see [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=271.72s)]
*  but it was also had to take the crew to the monolith and so the conclusion of the AI was to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=275.2s)]
*  kill the crew and take their bodies to the monolith. So [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=279.44s)]
*  the lesson there being don't force [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=283.24s)]
*  an AI to lie or do things that are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=286.32s)]
*  axiomatically incompatible. Like to do two things that are actually mutually [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=290.12s)]
*  impossible. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  So you know that's what we're trying to do with XAI and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=294.76s)]
*  Brock is to say like look we want to have a maximally truthful [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  AI even if what it says is not politically correct [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=303.08s)]
*  if you wanted to focus on being as [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=306.44s)]
*  accurate as possible. You're getting a round of applause from the audience on [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=310.23999999999995s)]
*  on those comments here. You know I saw your tweet the other day. I had [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=314.4s)]
*  I had Ray Kurzweil and Jeffrey Hinton on stage with me yesterday [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=318.84s)]
*  as well as Mogadat and then Eric Schmidt and a number of individuals and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  I saw your tweet about, yeah Ray was [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=327.52s)]
*  generally correct ahead of many people but we're likely to have [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=332.12s)]
*  call AGI what you will, have AGI next year and then by 2029 having AI [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  equally intelligent the entire human race. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=340.84s)]
*  Speak to that speed because that is insane. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=344.2s)]
*  Yeah so [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=347.32s)]
*  I mean I have to give credit to Ray Kurzweil in [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=350.88s)]
*  being actually remarkably accurate in his predictions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=353.96s)]
*  So [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  in fact if anything like I think he was perhaps a bit conservative [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=360.92s)]
*  in his predictions. So if you look at the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  amount of AI compute and the talent, at least the sort of human talent that is [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=369.12s)]
*  going into AI and the amount of compute that's going into AI [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=373.56s)]
*  it's you know at this point it's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=376.68s)]
*  it appears to be increasing by a factor of 10 the AI compute [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=380.36s)]
*  the dedicated AI compute appears to be growing by a factor of 10 every six months. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=384.16s)]
*  You know like so it's like basically close to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=389.44s)]
*  I'd say almost like a 100x improvement per year at least for the next few years [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  and AI compute coming online. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  And it seems like probably a lot of the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=400.92s)]
*  data centers, maybe most of the data centers that currently do kind of conventional [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=404.16s)]
*  compute will transition to AI compute. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=408.16s)]
*  So [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  it's certainly a good time to be in Nvidia obviously. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=416.24s)]
*  It's like you know and you've got to also give credit to Jensen [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=419.8s)]
*  and the Nvidia team for kind of seeing this coming and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=425.12s)]
*  making what at least currently is the best AI hardware out there. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=430.47999999999996s)]
*  So when you have that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=436.4s)]
*  level of compute growth and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=440.24s)]
*  it's sort of most on steroids next level [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=445.35999999999996s)]
*  in terms of how much compute is coming online [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  then you're just going to have acceleration that is unprecedented. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  In fact I've never seen any technology grow as fast as [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  as AI and I've seen a lot you know I've seen things [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=460.08s)]
*  fast but I've never seen anything this fast. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=463.68s)]
*  But you know like I said I think the most likely outcome is a positive one [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=467.52s)]
*  and you know I think in that positive scenario there's still [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=474.48s)]
*  challenges of like well how do we as humans still have relevance? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=480.56s)]
*  You know how do we find how do we find purpose? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=486.72s)]
*  How do we find purpose? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=491.6s)]
*  It's sort of a high class problem to say like well the computers are so good at [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=494.24s)]
*  doing everything and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  like I thought your book was pretty accurate in terms of the future [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=502.48s)]
*  being one of abundance where essentially goods and services will be [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  available in such quantity that really they'll be available to everyone. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=514.08s)]
*  Like basically if you want something you could just have it essentially. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=518.48s)]
*  Because if you've got AI and robotics the cost of goods and services [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=523.92s)]
*  is almost nothing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=528.64s)]
*  So if you think like what is an economy? An economy is [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=532.4s)]
*  basically number of people times average productivity per person [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=538.0s)]
*  at the point at which you have say advanced robotics [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=542.0s)]
*  and this you know this Tesla's developing Optimus [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=545.52s)]
*  we're obviously without cars which are really robots on four wheels [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=548.56s)]
*  and you know with the latest version of full self-driving which is AI end to end [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=553.28s)]
*  photons in and controls out it really is [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=560.4s)]
*  really fully AI at this point and it looks like a car but it's really a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=564.4s)]
*  robot on wheels and then you add the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=569.68s)]
*  humanoid robots in there there's really no limit to what the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=574.88s)]
*  economic output no no meaningful limit to what the economic output would be [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=580.24s)]
*  so you know looking on the bright side [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=585.28s)]
*  that we are headed for a future of abundance [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=589.6s)]
*  that I think that's the most likely outcome I think the only scarcity will [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=594.4s)]
*  that that exists will be scarcity that we [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=597.84s)]
*  just decide to create artificially like let's say [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=600.24s)]
*  we just decide that there's a unique work of art or something [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=603.28s)]
*  okay well it's just you just it's just artificial scarcity [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=606.4s)]
*  but but any kind of goods and services I think will be extremely abundant [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=610.16s)]
*  everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=614.24s)]
*  that's very important to me and could actually save your life or [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  the life of someone that you love company is called fountain life and it's [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=621.68s)]
*  a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=625.36s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians you know most of us don't actually know [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  what's going on inside our body we're all optimists until that day when you [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=632.88s)]
*  have a pain in your side you go to the physician in the emergency room and they [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=638.16s)]
*  say listen I'm sorry to tell you this but you have [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=641.68s)]

*  probably was a problem that's been going on for some time [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=649.68s)]

*  all right let's go back to our episode you know i can't imagine anybody who's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=752.96s)]
*  done a better job peering into the future by actually [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=757.0400000000001s)]
*  creating the future i'm curious how far out do you think [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  you're able to see how many years out beyond today given the speed of change [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=764.88s)]
*  well when when things are changing rapidly the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=782.88s)]
*  the ability to predict the future i think is [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=785.92s)]
*  uh becomes a lot harder because of the rate of change is so [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=788.72s)]
*  great um but i think some things are fairly obvious to predict which is that [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  we'll have um ai or hei that's at a level that it [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=798.72s)]
*  can really to almost any cognitive i think really not almost really any [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=803.52s)]
*  cognitive task that's just a question of when one could [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=807.28s)]
*  debate is it you know smarter than any human at the end of [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=810.0s)]
*  next year or is it two years or three years but it's not [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=813.84s)]
*  more than five years that's for sure um so um yeah and i get predictions [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=817.28s)]
*  predictions i'm sort of saying giving predictions at the 50th [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=823.36s)]
*  percentile of probability so not not not like it will definitely [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=827.36s)]
*  happen but if you say what if you're asking like what's the 50th [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=831.92s)]
*  percentile uh where it's like you know you're kind of [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=834.48s)]
*  over under is kind of even that that's where i why why i think it's [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=840.4s)]
*  probably at the next year before ai can do better than any individual human could [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=844.64s)]
*  do um and then uh but there's it's a it's a [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=850.16s)]
*  much higher bar to say well is this one than um [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=854.56s)]
*  you know human intelligence collectively but if the rate of change [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  continues uh that that's why i think probably [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=863.8399999999999s)]
*  2029 or maybe 2030 is where digital intelligence will [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=866.2399999999999s)]
*  probably exceed all human intelligence combined [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=871.76s)]
*  um and and i think it's always helpful to look at these like fundamental [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=875.12s)]
*  ratios um you know sort of physics first [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=878.48s)]
*  principles approach to to looking at things [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=881.76s)]
*  and and probabilistic and probabilistic yeah so [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=884.24s)]
*  yeah it's probabilistic so um the uh yeah so um [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=890.4s)]
*  if you look at the ratio of digital to biological compute [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=898.1600000000001s)]
*  so like like you know we'll look say all of the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=902.5600000000001s)]
*  higher level cognitive if you sum up the higher level cognitive [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=906.1600000000001s)]
*  capacity of of humans um and then what is the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=909.5200000000001s)]
*  where and think of that as compute then uh [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=914.08s)]
*  well and then compare that to what is what is the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=917.6s)]
*  digital compute um and the rate at which this is growing is just [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=921.12s)]
*  boggles the mind so that's why i think it's [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=926.4s)]
*  you know i think 2029 or 2030 or thereabouts [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=931.12s)]
*  is is uh it's not a that's i think a reasonable [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=934.24s)]
*  time frame for where you'd expect the the cumulative digital compute to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=938.9599999999999s)]
*  probably exceed the cumulative biological compute [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=945.36s)]
*  of higher level brain functions um and then from from then forever yeah [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=948.0799999999999s)]
*  and still in in dispatching and diverging forever from there [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=954.56s)]
*  yeah and then yeah where do things go from there i don't know probably [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=961.92s)]
*  continues um the we are moving from you say if you look at the the limiting [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=965.3599999999999s)]
*  factors of you know the what is the constraint on growth [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=972.8s)]
*  um like last year it was clearly uh ai chips [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=976.7199999999999s)]
*  were the constraint on growth um then then this year the one of the biggest [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=980.56s)]
*  constraints the biggest constraints on on growth um are [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=986.64s)]
*  voltage step down transformers because you know the [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  just just getting the power from like a utility at 300 kilovolts all the way [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=994.0s)]
*  down to below one volt for the computer is a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=997.5999999999999s)]
*  massive amount of voltage uh step down so it's it's uh you know my [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1000.7199999999999s)]
*  sort of very very niche and perhaps not that funny joke is [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1005.68s)]
*  uh that uh we need transformers for transformers [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1008.64s)]
*  um say we need voltage transformer or ai neural net transformers um that that is [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1012.72s)]
*  literally the issue uh this year um and then if i'm saying [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1019.52s)]
*  like next year i need years beyond that it's [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1023.92s)]
*  actually just it's going to be constraints on electric [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1027.12s)]
*  like um electrical power um and you've got both ai with very [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1029.84s)]
*  big demands for electrical power and the transition to sustainable energy [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1036.8s)]
*  with electric vehicles whatnot also needing electrical power [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1041.9199999999998s)]
*  so it's uh it's just a lot a lot of electrical power needs [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1045.28s)]
*  you know elon one of the one of the things that you said early on when you [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1049.68s)]
*  when you founded neurolink um which has been amazing congratulations on that [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1055.2s)]
*  now we talked about this with ray yesterday talked about high bandwidth bci [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1061.04s)]
*  uh was i wouldn't put words in your mouth but i would say it would be [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1065.52s)]
*  more along the lines if you can't beat them join them um when it comes to uh [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1068.8s)]
*  you know merging the neocortex in the cloud can you [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1073.52s)]
*  uh i'm looking forward to it i'm just curious what your thoughts are about [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1077.92s)]
*  uh what's driving that i mean adding adding that additional [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1082.32s)]
*  computational capacity and sensory capacity to the neocortex [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1087.2s)]
*  yeah i mean again this is actually something that [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1093.76s)]
*  in banks uh in the culture books which i really recommend everyone read [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1097.04s)]
*  um that in the uh culture books there's uh something called a neural lace so all [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1101.28s)]
*  the humans have this neural lace that's kind of [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1107.92s)]
*  um a very essentially a high bandwidth uh brain to computer interface um and [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1112.48s)]
*  um and in the in the at least in the [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1119.6s)]
*  culture books it's so good that it actually retains all of your memories [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1122.3999999999999s)]
*  and kind of brain state so even if your physical body dies you can kind of [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1126.56s)]
*  re-incorporated in another physical body and retain [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1130.9599999999998s)]
*  you know pretty much your original memories and and brain state [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1134.48s)]
*  um so now i think it's a long way from that um we only just had our first [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1138.1599999999999s)]
*  uh uh neural link in a human which is going it's going quite well [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1146.24s)]
*  um the uh the first patient is actually able to [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1150.4s)]
*  uh control their computer uh just by thinking [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1155.28s)]
*  like this first the first uh product we call telepathy [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1159.68s)]
*  where you can control your computer and phone and through and through your [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  computer phone almost anything just by thinking you just lie there [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1166.64s)]
*  and think and you can move them at the mouse cursor around the screen and [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1170.8000000000002s)]
*  things and play like you know the we're gonna do uh [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1174.72s)]
*  look patient has agreed to do sort of uh uh like i think a live demo of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1180.72s)]
*  just it is quadriplegic uh where he literally is just controlling the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1185.92s)]
*  screen he can like um play video games download software [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1190.48s)]
*  uh like really anything you can do with a mouse [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1195.2s)]
*  um just by thinking um which is pretty wild it is it is pretty wild [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1198.24s)]
*  uh let's turn to one last i should say there's a long way to go from that to [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  a whole brain interface so our current uh neural link just has a thousand [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1212.0s)]
*  electrodes i think ultimately you need something [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1217.28s)]
*  which which has you know probably a hundred thousand or a [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1220.16s)]
*  million electrodes now these are very tiny [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1224.0s)]
*  very tiny electrodes that they're tiny wires wasteful of the human hair [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1226.4s)]
*  um and um you know so there's this i just want to emphasize a long way from [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1230.88s)]
*  from where do you like this today to having a whole brain interface [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1237.0400000000002s)]
*  like um like the neural lace and the in banks [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1240.24s)]
*  uh novels uh but this is definitely physically possible [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1243.52s)]
*  um and um you know it's sort of kind of like if you can't beat him join him [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1249.2s)]
*  you know um so you know human our human brain which is has a lot of constraints [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1253.84s)]
*  it's you know it's it's it's yeah we only have about [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1260.48s)]
*  but maybe 10 watts of higher brain function [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1263.76s)]
*  and uh we do a lot with our little 10 watts it's not [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1267.52s)]
*  you know it's impressive you know that we've we've [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1271.52s)]
*  both station with um such a low power computer really [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1275.28s)]
*  um it it is you know i sort of think it's like [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1281.6799999999998s)]
*  it's not bad for a bunch of monkeys you know [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1286.08s)]
*  yeah again some good laughs from that and we've all watched you go from the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1291.1999999999998s)]
*  the roadster to the model three and why and and from [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1294.8799999999999s)]
*  falcon one to starship so i think going from the first implants to [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1298.6399999999999s)]
*  something that's got more capacity it's just a just a matter of if not when [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1304.0s)]
*  or matter of when not if right hey everyone i want to take a quick break [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1308.6399999999999s)]

*  right let's go back to the episode um let's talk to yeah i think ultimately [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1398.96s)]
*  you're like said you'll have uh like um you'll have uh kind of a [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1403.92s)]
*  whole brain interface uh that uh i guess is a sort of perhaps a [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1410.16s)]
*  form of immortality and that if it if it can um [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1416.16s)]
*  uh kind of upload your brain state uh to you know if your brain state is [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1421.28s)]
*  essentially stored um you're kind of backed up on a hard [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1428.08s)]
*  drive i suppose um then uh you know you can always restore [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1431.68s)]
*  that brain state into a biological body or or maybe a robot or [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1436.3999999999999s)]
*  something um and i want to emphasize again it's [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1440.8s)]
*  like you know many years in the future but but [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1443.92s)]
*  we're not breaking any laws of physics i think this is this is probably [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1447.04s)]
*  something that will happen um that the the way we're building [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1450.4s)]
*  digital super intelligence it may just be that [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1457.0400000000002s)]
*  you know we'll have digital super intelligence and it'll just solve the [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1459.92s)]
*  solve the problem for us um but in the meantime uh we'll keep [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1462.96s)]
*  progressing with our me computers and uh trying to try to do as [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1468.48s)]
*  do as good a job as possible that's what i was going to say the uh [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1473.2800000000002s)]
*  the tools that we have are growing at a super exponential rate [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1477.36s)]
*  that are making our linear projections of the future seem boring in some ways [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1480.7199999999998s)]
*  yes what one last topic my friend uh which is where you and i first connected [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  in the world of space uh congratulations on starship three [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1490.32s)]
*  uh amazing amazing flight just really spectacular [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1494.3999999999999s)]
*  and we all saw a falcon 9 launch from vandenberg last night [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1498.2399999999998s)]
*  uh so that was great and uh um just again thankful for the work you're [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1502.48s)]
*  doing you know i it's fascinating because i grew up at the late stages of [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1510.24s)]
*  the apollo and into into the uh into the uh shuttle program [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1514.72s)]
*  and i can't imagine that any government would be pushing space [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1521.28s)]
*  as rapidly and dramatically as you are and so um [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1525.6s)]
*  thank you for what you're doing there that's all i can say [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1532.32s)]
*  uh absolutely well i mean the the goal of spacex is [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1535.6s)]
*  is it's just a much bigger goal than any any government program which is [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1539.9199999999998s)]
*  to um rockets and spacecraft that are capable of making life [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1544.8s)]
*  multi-planetary so you know i mean step one is actually [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1550.0s)]
*  having that as a goal if you don't have that as a goal you're [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1554.8799999999999s)]
*  definitely not going to achieve it um if you have it as a goal well now at [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1557.6799999999998s)]
*  least you have a chance of achieving it um and this the thing about starship is [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1561.68s)]
*  it is it is uh the first rocket where uh making life multi-planetary and [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1566.8s)]
*  building a self-sustaining city on mars is uh is at least possible um uh it's [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1573.8400000000001s)]
*  still obviously an immense amount of work but [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1580.4s)]
*  but it is the first rocket where um that is [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1582.4s)]
*  success of in making like multi-planetary is at least one of the possible [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1585.76s)]
*  outcomes [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1590.04s)]
*  yeah um i'm wondering if you're willing to venture a guess on when you'll be on [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1592.8s)]
*  the moon [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1597.84s)]
*  i think pretty soon um i'd be surprised if it's if it's long [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1601.28s)]
*  than about three years uh to be landing starships on the [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1607.36s)]
*  moon um and uh because the rate of progression [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1610.32s)]
*  of starship is very rapid um you know we're hoping to do at least [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1614.56s)]
*  another maybe five or six flights this year and with each successive flight [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1620.24s)]
*  making significant improvements uh so i think we've got a decent shot of [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1624.4s)]
*  achieving um full reusability of both stages [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1630.6399999999999s)]
*  uh booster and the ship uh this year um and if not this year i think you know [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1635.52s)]
*  knock on wood it's like i think it's a very high probability of [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1641.28s)]
*  achieving full reusability uh next year which um really is the [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1644.16s)]
*  fundamental breakthrough needed to make life multi-planetary [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1649.12s)]
*  um yeah for those that that that that don't [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1653.1999999999998s)]
*  don't know the rocket industry that that well that they may not be aware that [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1659.6799999999998s)]
*  that this is really the holy grail of rocketry is [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1663.52s)]
*  is full full and rapid reusability um because at that point you're uh you're [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1666.32s)]
*  really just constrained by your propellant costs and starship you [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1671.9199999999998s)]
*  know almost 80 percent of the propellant is liquid oxygen which is [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1677.12s)]
*  very low cost um and then the fuel is meant to be this sort of little over 20 [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1680.9599999999998s)]
*  percent uh fuel which is methane also the lowest cost fuel so if you have um [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1685.12s)]
*  uh fuller after usability uh then um your actual cost of a flight of [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1690.2399999999998s)]
*  starship uh even though it's it'll be capable of um we [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1695.84s)]
*  think ultimately 200 tons to uh to orbit uh will be maybe a little too [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1699.12s)]
*  really positive [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1705.3999999999999s)]
*  say miss that's 200 000 you said [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1708.3999999999999s)]
*  the price of the fuel you said for a starship flight [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1713.4399999999998s)]
*  would be how much [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  yeah the the i mean if both things are um [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  reusable and without a refurbishment then you or without you know you'd [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1728.08s)]
*  have scheduled maintenance just like a an aircraft but uh if you get to full [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1733.68s)]
*  reusability where there's no um no work required between flights then [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1740.8s)]
*  you you then um the cost you know is really [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akXMYvKjUxM&t=1746.48s)]
