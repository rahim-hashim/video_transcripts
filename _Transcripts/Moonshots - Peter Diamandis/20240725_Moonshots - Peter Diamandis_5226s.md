# How To Be Insanely Productive Even with ADHD w/ Dr. Jeff Karp | EP #111
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU)
*  You know, I had a lot of teachers that were giving me labels. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=0.0s)]
*  Lazy, lost cause, troublemaker. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4.2s)]
*  Once I was helping another child and the teacher came over and said, oh, isn't that the blind [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=7.8s)]
*  leading the blind? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=12.36s)]
*  They asked me one day, what do you want to be? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=13.36s)]
*  And I said, I want to be a doctor. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=14.88s)]
*  The teacher said, well, you better set your sights lower because you really just don't [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  have that in you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=19.6s)]
*  I felt like I always had to work twice as hard as everyone else. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=21.42s)]
*  I was the kid who was going in on weekends, like trying to meet with teachers to go over [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  things and after school. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=27.76s)]
*  Like I almost felt like kind of looking back, like I had this hardware in my mind, but I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=29.6s)]
*  didn't have software. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=34.68s)]
*  What's your advice to a mom or dad in this situation with their young child? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=36.0s)]
*  What I've learned is... [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=44.2s)]
*  Today I'm going to be speaking to Dr. Jeff Karp, professor at MIT in Harvard, the founder [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=45.2s)]
*  of 13 different companies, a gentleman who is using a whole slew of exponential technologies [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=50.14s)]
*  to reinvent products that impact our lives. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=56.56s)]
*  We'll talk about this product. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  I love Prophy Spray, 99.99% prevention of influenza and COVID-19, couple sprays in the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=60.84s)]
*  nose. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=69.12s)]
*  It's like a HEPA filter for your nose. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=70.12s)]
*  But beyond that, we'll talk about his book Lit, which is extraordinary. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=71.84s)]
*  Talk about learning how to think about how you think, interviewing 40 extraordinary individuals [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=76.2s)]
*  on the processes that make them successful in life. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Join me for a fascinating conversation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=85.56s)]
*  If you love conversations like we're about to have, please subscribe. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=87.36s)]
*  Allows me to bring incredible people to you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=91.92s)]
*  We'll talk about his MTP, his Moonshots, and hopefully inspire you to go bigger and bolder [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=94.2s)]
*  in the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Jeff Karp, welcome to Moonshots. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  So great to be here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=102.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=103.16s)]
*  A pleasure. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=104.16s)]
*  You know, it was the first time we're physically meeting. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=105.16s)]
*  We know we have a lot in common because we both have these beautiful purple pilot pens, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=106.16s)]
*  which are... which I love. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  We're at Harvard MIT now as a professor, my alma mater, which I love deeply. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=113.72s)]
*  What's it like there right now? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  Is it... are you a kid in a candy store at this moment? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=121.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=124.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=125.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=126.8s)]
*  It's... everybody's coming up with ideas. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=127.8s)]
*  Our access to tools is just exceptional. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=131.12s)]
*  New tools coming online constantly. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=134.5s)]
*  Science is moving at a faster pace than ever. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=137.44s)]
*  And we're really faced with tough decisions to make about what to focus on. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=146.52s)]
*  I think it's interesting because there's so much going on in the whole biotech, AI, robotics, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=147.52s)]
*  3D printing world, new material sciences, that it's like an abundance of massive entrepreneurial [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=155.08s)]
*  opportunities. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=163.52s)]
*  And yeah, it's interesting. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=164.52s)]
*  Do you know Martin Rothblatt? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=168.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=169.56s)]
*  She's been my friend for 40 years, I mean, during her extraordinary journey. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=171.16s)]
*  And she once told me something that I'll never forget. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=175.76s)]
*  She says, successful people say no to most things. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=178.12s)]
*  The most successful people say no to everything. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=182.68s)]
*  And that's always been a problem for me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=185.9s)]
*  Just actually saying no and focusing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=188.16s)]
*  How about you? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=192.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=193.84s)]
*  It's definitely been a challenge, especially with my ADHD. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=194.84s)]
*  I think it's because I find like I just have boundless curiosity about everything. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=198.92s)]
*  But at the same time, I feel it's important to say no a lot of the time. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=207.72s)]
*  But I think it's also important to say yes for things that you're unsure about because [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=213.48s)]
*  there's always opportunities to learn in every encounter. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=218.92s)]
*  And I feel that when I start saying no to everything, it kind of becomes this algorithm [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=222.76s)]
*  that then limits me from, it sort of narrows what I potentially can learn about, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=228.04s)]
*  Because it almost, it reduces the diversity of opportunities that I'm engaging in. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=234.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  And you never know where some right angle, where you break out of a local maxima and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  break into a brand new space of discovery and joy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think given where you are in the, I mean, as a professor, I mean, you run the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=253.44s)]
*  CARP labs at Harvard Medical School. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  I want to dive into what does that mean? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=260.6s)]
*  We mind mapped your world and I have like 50% on your labs. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=263.16s)]
*  We'll talk about that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=267.52s)]
*  You know, 40% on your seven year effort on building this book called Lit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=268.52s)]
*  And then 10% on some other areas and there's probably another 50% we haven't talked about [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=273.4s)]
*  yet. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=278.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=279.44s)]
*  Because it always adds up to 150%. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=280.44s)]
*  But in, as a professor, as a scientist, as a researcher, going down rabbit holes has [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=281.48s)]
*  got to be part of the job description. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=291.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, absolutely. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=293.56s)]
*  And I think for us, it's almost one of those things where whenever we come up with ideas [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=295.76s)]
*  for projects, we get excited about it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=302.08s)]
*  I know now from sort of engaging in this process many times that our best ideas come from the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  challenges, the roadblocks, the hurdles that we encounter along the way. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  That's when we actually become the most creative, the most insightful. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=318.56s)]
*  And so often we need to go down these kind of rabbit holes in order to discover what's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=323.2s)]
*  truly most important. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=329.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=331.0s)]
*  You have another element to you, which is the entrepreneur, which is building companies. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=332.0s)]
*  And that becomes interesting because while you've got to focus on the product, the market, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=339.52s)]
*  and make something that people want and need and is sufficiently differentiated, and if [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=349.12s)]
*  you keep on chasing it, you never get something out the door. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=356.2s)]
*  Yeah, I had this kind of holy crap moment when I was transitioning out of my postdoc [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=362.32s)]
*  into my faculty position because I discovered that I was during my postdoc and my PhD, I [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=367.56s)]
*  had very entrepreneurial mentors trained in Bob Langer's lab for my postdoc. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=373.2s)]
*  And it was a holy crap moment for me because I really wanted to focus my laboratory on [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=379.64s)]
*  not just publishing papers, but taking that science and turning it into products that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=386.56s)]
*  could help patients. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  But I realized that I didn't have a process for doing it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=392.92s)]
*  I had observed other people doing it, but I didn't do it for myself. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=396.0s)]
*  And anytime in my life where I encounter something I can't do or I don't feel I'm good at, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=400.8s)]
*  I recognize that it's not because it's inherently bad at something, it's just because I haven't [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=407.68s)]
*  found a process that works for me. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=413.76s)]
*  And so I began to explore how might I engage in experimenting with various processes to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=415.96s)]
*  find what would work for me so that I could develop a translational program for my research. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=424.52s)]
*  That is fascinating. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=433.44s)]
*  And being in Bob Langer's lab, right, who's prolific, he, George Church, they're these [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=435.2s)]
*  prolific professors who are just driving science and building companies. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=440.68s)]
*  And it's like, again, kid in the candy store type of, you know, when I was at MIT, I was [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=446.88s)]
*  there from 80 through 90 at MIT and Harvard Med School. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=451.88s)]
*  It wasn't the entrepreneurial era yet. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=460.52s)]
*  I think MIT cared a lot more about Nobel prizes than it did anything else. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=462.48s)]
*  How do you feel it is now? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=468.4s)]
*  I was just on the phone literally before coming up here with two of my fraternity brothers, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=469.4s)]
*  Dave Blunden and Mike Saylor, both MITers and both incredibly successful entrepreneurs. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=473.36s)]
*  We were just talking about how do we stoke that entrepreneurial fire? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=479.2s)]
*  Is the ethos at MIT more about starting companies now versus fundamental science? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=485.6s)]
*  I think so. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=491.44s)]
*  I think there's been a huge transition over the past maybe 15, 20 years or so. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=492.44s)]
*  And I think what's really fueled that is just a few notable academics who have spun off [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=498.56s)]
*  companies that have had massive impact on society, like Phil Sharp with Biogen, Bob Langer [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=506.16s)]
*  with Moderna and many other companies. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=514.1600000000001s)]
*  And I think when other sort of colleagues, academics see what's possible, there's this [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  huge gravity to sort of this realization that there's an opportunity to impact the world [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=524.72s)]
*  in such amazingly positive ways through using company formation as a vehicle and seeing [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  examples of it around you. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=540.48s)]
*  I think just you kind of get inspired and it sort of creates this energy that maybe [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  you could do it as well. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=548.96s)]
*  And I think now it's almost every professor, every doctor that I speak to in Boston is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=550.0400000000001s)]
*  interested in starting companies. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=557.24s)]
*  It used to be like discovering some fundamental truth of science or physics was fascinating. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=560.0400000000001s)]
*  But now it's like discovering it and actually using it to go and change the world, operationalizing [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=566.84s)]
*  it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  I think one of the people actually I interviewed for the book, David Suzuki, who's an environmentalist [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  and he had the longest running show on Canadian television, I think it called The Nature of [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=583.48s)]
*  Things. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=589.2s)]
*  And one of the things that he focused on in my conversation with him was what is a [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=590.2s)]
*  enough and how we need to spend more of our time on exploration, because that's one of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=596.68s)]
*  the things that I struggle with in my life is that I've focused a lot on translation. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=603.4s)]
*  But at the same time, the products that are being translated, it also creates environmental [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=609.8399999999999s)]
*  challenges. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=615.7199999999999s)]
*  There's sustainability issues that come from the products that we're making. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=616.7199999999999s)]
*  It's sort of like trying to strike that balance between exploration and basic science and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=622.32s)]
*  the impacts of what we're developing, but then also pushing the fringe, the leading [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=628.48s)]
*  edge on maximizing positive impact for humans and for the earth. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=633.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=639.72s)]
*  And so the question becomes, when you're trying to get, what are you optimizing around? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=640.72s)]
*  What's your optimization function? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=644.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=645.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=646.6s)]
*  And I'll come back to that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=647.6s)]
*  On moonshots, we talk a lot about to entrepreneurs about your massive transformative purpose [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=651.96s)]
*  in your moonshot. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=656.4s)]
*  Like, I define an MTP as something that wakes you up in the morning, keeps you going at [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=657.96s)]
*  night. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  It's your North Star. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=662.9200000000001s)]
*  It is what drives you. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=663.9200000000001s)]
*  What drives you? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=668.2s)]
*  I think what drives me has changed over time. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=670.94s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=674.44s)]
*  One of the things, by the way, for me too, right? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=675.44s)]
*  I'm in my third or fourth MTP. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=677.36s)]
*  It was like started space and then went on to solving global grand challenges and then [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=679.2s)]
*  supporting entrepreneurs and now in longevity. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=686.96s)]
*  So take me back. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=690.4000000000001s)]
*  What have been your sort of like your decadal MTPs, if you would? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=696.6400000000001s)]
*  Love that question. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=697.6400000000001s)]
*  Such a great framing. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=698.72s)]
*  So I would say, okay, so I go way back. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=700.98s)]
*  The initial one was really around, you know, I was struggling with undiagnosed ADHD and [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=705.4200000000001s)]
*  learning differences when I was younger. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=710.3000000000001s)]
*  This is at what age? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=711.94s)]
*  In the second grade when I was seven years old. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=713.78s)]
*  I'd sit at the back of the class completely frustrated, feeling demoralized. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=716.46s)]
*  Nothing was working. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=721.82s)]
*  My mom tried flashcards, cue cards. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=723.26s)]
*  Nothing worked. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=726.16s)]
*  I couldn't, I wasn't able to keep up with anything. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=727.16s)]
*  I wasn't connected socially with anybody. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=729.98s)]
*  And what happened was the teacher at the end of the year pulled my parents aside and said [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=732.5s)]
*  that he would like to have me repeat the second grade. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=736.9200000000001s)]
*  And my parents negotiated for me to spend time with tutors during the summer to then [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=741.66s)]
*  be able to catch up and go on to the third grade. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=746.38s)]
*  And what happened that summer is I went in one day and the tutor asked, you know, read [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=749.4200000000001s)]
*  a passage, asked me some questions. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=755.66s)]
*  I gave some answers, but then she asked me a question that no one had ever asked me before [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=758.4599999999999s)]
*  that transformed my life and led to the first, you called it MTP. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=762.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=768.02s)]
*  My first, yeah, massive transformative purpose. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=769.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=774.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=775.42s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=776.42s)]
*  And that was, so I gave the answers and then she looked me in the eye and she said, how [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=777.66s)]
*  did you think about that? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=782.06s)]
*  That question actually created this new found awareness for me that that was so transformative [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=785.5s)]
*  because it then became my mission to figure out, like I almost felt like kind of looking [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=794.1s)]
*  back, like I had this hardware in my mind, but I didn't have software and I had to [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=799.98s)]
*  figure out how do I test various algorithms, patterns that I was observing in other people [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=805.74s)]
*  to create my own software for functioning and surviving in the education system. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=811.7s)]
*  So that was my first sort of mission that I was focused on. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=817.5400000000001s)]
*  What's your advice to a mom or dad in this situation with their young child? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=824.58s)]
*  Well, one of the things that- [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=832.5s)]
*  I know you've got an entire book on this, so we'll get into it in a little bit. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=834.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, I think for me, what I've realized and I feel like parenting is perhaps one of [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=837.7s)]
*  the most challenging jobs, roles that anyone could ever have. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=844.26s)]
*  And the most important for society and for everyone. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=848.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=851.1s)]
*  And what I've learned is first and foremost is just to find ways to support children in [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=852.1s)]
*  whatever they're experiencing and going through. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=859.5400000000001s)]
*  I feel like there's been this tendency for me with my children to kind of try to push [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=862.3000000000001s)]
*  them to extract potential because I see this incredible potential in my children and I [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=866.82s)]
*  find myself almost sort of treating them as if I was treating myself. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=871.9s)]
*  I'm always trying to extract my potential and I feel that that doesn't work really [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=878.42s)]
*  well. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=884.9s)]
*  And what works well, I think, is the support, just finding ways to support. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=885.9s)]
*  And one of the ways that my mom supported me was here I was like a C&D student really [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=890.14s)]
*  struggling, feeling like I didn't fit in like an alien. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=895.7s)]
*  I think a lot of kids kind of slip through the cracks and who are neurodiverse and become [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=899.38s)]
*  addicts. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=904.3000000000001s)]
*  And my mom wrote speeches for me because there was public speaking contests and she would [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=906.0600000000001s)]
*  coach me in memorizing and saying these speeches and I got better and better and better and [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=911.1400000000001s)]
*  I started to win competitions. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=917.1800000000001s)]
*  And so that was the one thing that I had going for me where I was able to build my confidence. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=920.0600000000001s)]
*  So I think that kind of the parallel or potential there for advice maybe for parents is to find [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=925.2600000000001s)]
*  that one thing where whatever it could be anything where the child can build a little [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=933.6600000000001s)]
*  bit of confidence every day. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=938.74s)]
*  Maybe it's like finding a mentor who can help that the child's really excited to be with [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=940.9000000000001s)]
*  and learn from and to explore and build skills and really tap into that, the energy that [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=947.3000000000001s)]
*  we get from learning and gaining insights and building a skill because I think that [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=954.58s)]
*  can really carry the day and that always stays with you. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=959.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think about my parents wanted me to become a doctor. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=962.74s)]
*  I wanted to become an astronaut, right? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=967.1s)]
*  And that struggle and I went through medical school and make my parents happy, shipped [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=969.7800000000001s)]
*  my dad a copy of my diploma when I graduated and then went on to follow my space passions. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=975.1s)]
*  I've come back full cycle to medicine a few decades later. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=981.26s)]
*  Did your parents have a mission or purpose for you? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=986.38s)]
*  Or I felt like there was a lot of dentists in my family. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=988.86s)]
*  There's some doctors in my family and I did feel that that was sort of the path that people [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=995.86s)]
*  would sort of there was appreciation for anyone in the family who the way people talked, spoke [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1002.86s)]
*  about other family members and going into careers if it was like a doctor or a lawyer [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1010.2199999999999s)]
*  or something like that, the dentist, people would get excited about it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1014.54s)]
*  But I also I think I had a lot of teachers that were giving me labels and so like lazy, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1021.78s)]
*  lost cause, troublemaker. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1028.78s)]
*  Once I was helping another child and the teacher came over and said, oh, isn't that like the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1035.94s)]
*  blind leading the blind? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1041.98s)]
*  And then they asked me one day, what do you want to be? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1044.62s)]
*  And I said, I want to be a doctor. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1046.54s)]
*  The teacher said, well, you better set your sights lower because you really just don't [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1048.62s)]
*  have that in you. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1051.94s)]
*  American education system at work, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1053.34s)]
*  My parents were more focused on trying to not let that become my label. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1056.58s)]
*  My mom constantly was telling me, she was like, you have superpowers and it was kind [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1065.8999999999999s)]
*  of hard for me to believe, but she said it so often that I started to believe it and [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1070.22s)]
*  I started to imagine it and kind of fantasize about that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1076.6599999999999s)]
*  And I remember distinctly in elementary school, like being in class trying to almost like [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1080.26s)]
*  think that I could see things that others couldn't and I couldn't really, but like I [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1085.26s)]
*  felt like maybe I could, you know, like it's a confidence building game to believe in yourself [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1089.66s)]
*  and not let yourself be put down by the world around you. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1094.78s)]
*  So that was your sort of first MTP early on. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1099.14s)]
*  Where'd you go next on on your purpose? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1102.58s)]
*  What was it that drove you? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1106.44s)]
*  So what happened was my okay. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1107.72s)]
*  So my mom, nobody wanted to do anything about these challenges I was encountering. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1110.86s)]
*  No one was talking about ADHD at the time. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1115.58s)]
*  My mom went up against the school board on her own with a massive file. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1118.02s)]
*  She had recorded everything that teachers had ever said, written about me, all my grades [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1122.4599999999998s)]
*  and everything. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1126.2199999999998s)]
*  And she went to the school board and actually got me identified as having learning differences, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1127.2199999999998s)]
*  which then got me special accommodations, a little bit extra space, extra time on my [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1132.06s)]
*  assignments and tests and exams. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1136.4199999999998s)]
*  I had been developing all these tools, steadying patterns in. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1139.54s)]
*  How old are you at this point? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1144.42s)]
*  At this point, I would have been, let's see, maybe 12. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1145.66s)]
*  And what happened was my grades went from Cs and Ds to straight As and the struggles [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1153.34s)]
*  remained. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1158.8600000000001s)]
*  I felt like I always had to work twice as hard as everyone else. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1159.8600000000001s)]
*  I was always, I was the kid who was going in on weekends, like trying to meet with teachers [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1162.8600000000001s)]
*  to go over things and after school and just constantly working and trying to focus because [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1166.4799999999998s)]
*  my, I was pretty extreme ADHD. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1173.4799999999998s)]
*  And so the next sort of, you know, MTP phase for me was focusing on how I could maintain [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1176.32s)]
*  straight As because my grades went to straight As. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1183.24s)]
*  As soon as I got into the seventh grade, my grades went to straight As. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1185.24s)]
*  And so I just kept focusing on, I guess the MTP was on how could I improve my efficiencies [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1188.36s)]
*  because everything took me a long time. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1195.48s)]
*  It was almost like, you know, in the movie Terminator, the original one, there's this [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1197.24s)]
*  scene where he goes to say something and the screen pops up and there's like five or six [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1201.48s)]
*  different options of what he can say and he's trying to figure out which one and then, you [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1207.96s)]
*  know, select something. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1212.3600000000001s)]
*  That's how I feel even today. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1213.72s)]
*  Like, it's like I see many possibilities when I'm asked a question in, let's say in school. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1215.8000000000002s)]
*  I see many possible answers and I don't know which one the teacher wants the most. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1223.0400000000002s)]
*  And so I need time to figure out the probabilities around which answer to give back. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1228.24s)]
*  And that actually makes it really challenging for me to help my children with their homework. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1233.3600000000001s)]
*  They don't like me. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1237.0400000000002s)]
*  They say they don't want me to help them at all because I don't really, I don't see [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1237.68s)]
*  the linear way that this education system kind of works. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1243.76s)]
*  And so my focus then at that time was really on how do I get more efficient? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1247.9199999999998s)]
*  How do I observe people around me and what are their tools and strategies for being [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1253.9199999999998s)]
*  efficient with their time and how do they approach problems and doing their homework [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1258.32s)]
*  and doing these things and what can I experiment with? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1262.72s)]
*  And I almost see everything as algorithms around me. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1265.84s)]
*  So I'm constantly trying different algorithms that I see in environments, how people behave, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1268.6399999999999s)]
*  what they say in certain scenarios. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1275.36s)]
*  And then I try those algorithms on and see how they feel. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1277.12s)]
*  And I'm constantly iterating and adapting them. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1280.32s)]
*  And so that's where a huge part of my life was focused after the seventh grade. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1283.1999999999998s)]
*  You sound like a perfect analog for an AI learning system. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1287.36s)]
*  Everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you love. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1297.84s)]
*  Company is called Fountain Life. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1303.28s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1305.28s)]
*  physicians. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1310.24s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1310.96s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1315.36s)]
*  Until that day when you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1317.04s)]
*  room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1321.44s)]
*  four going on. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1325.76s)]
*  And, you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1326.72s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1329.68s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1333.12s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1336.7199999999998s)]

*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1346.8799999999999s)]

*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1363.6799999999998s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1370.6399999999999s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1373.6s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1375.52s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1377.76s)]

*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1433.1200000000001s)]
*  Fast forwarding to your professional career. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1434.96s)]
*  What was your first MTP there? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1437.04s)]
*  What was your first purpose? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1438.5600000000002s)]
*  So my PhD advisors and my postdoc advisor mentor were highly entrepreneurial. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1440.48s)]
*  And I saw by being in their laboratories, the potential of science to have a massive [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1449.8400000000001s)]
*  impact on humanity. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1456.0800000000002s)]
*  And then I realized kind of going back to this holy crap moment that I didn't have [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1459.6000000000001s)]
*  a process for doing it. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1462.72s)]
*  So I was on the hunt for how could I develop a process to maximize the translation of [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1464.24s)]
*  everything that I worked on? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1472.24s)]
*  How could every project I worked on turn into a potential company that could then bring [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1473.52s)]
*  products into clinical trials and eventually to patients? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1478.4s)]
*  And so what I did is I... [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1481.52s)]
*  By the way, that decision to make sure that whatever you worked on actually wasn't just [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1484.48s)]
*  for a publication endpoint or wasn't just for some prize endpoint was actually going [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1491.68s)]
*  to be meaningful for society, probably was a critically important filter for you. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1497.52s)]
*  It was huge. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1503.2s)]
*  And it was also, I feel, because I was open to the cues, I feel all of us have this core [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1505.04s)]
*  wisdom. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1510.88s)]
*  And in the environments that we're in, if we sort of let ourselves sort of get into [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1511.6000000000001s)]
*  a state where we can feel as we're observing what's happening around us. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1517.2s)]
*  And when I was in, for example, Bob Langer's lab, and I could just see the positivity of [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1524.56s)]
*  how science could be translated into products and really change people's lives. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1533.04s)]
*  And that just, to me, seemed right. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1537.8400000000001s)]
*  It just seemed like that's what I really needed to focus on. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1540.88s)]
*  And so I just felt deeply connected to that and that became my mission. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1544.48s)]
*  But I didn't have a process. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1551.3600000000001s)]
*  And so what I did was I said, okay, I started thinking about problem definition. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1552.48s)]
*  So I started to realize that what separates an academic project from a translational project [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1559.04s)]
*  that can really lead to impact is the problem definition. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1566.0s)]
*  Most of the time when we're doing academic projects, we're focused on just the biology [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1571.6s)]
*  problem. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1577.6799999999998s)]
*  What's the target? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1578.8799999999999s)]
*  What's this kind of thinking? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1579.9199999999998s)]
*  Or the medical problem. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1582.1599999999999s)]
*  But I realized that it was almost like a Venn diagram, an overlapping circles where there [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1583.28s)]
*  was also the manufacturing problem. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1588.8799999999999s)]
*  There was the patent problem. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1590.8s)]
*  There was the regulatory problem. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1592.48s)]
*  There was the biology problem. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1594.3999999999999s)]
*  There was the medical problem. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1595.6799999999998s)]
*  There was the practical implementation problem. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1596.9599999999998s)]
*  There was the sales problem. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1599.12s)]
*  There was a financing problem. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1600.08s)]
*  A problem marketing problem. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1601.8400000000001s)]
*  There's all these things. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1603.1200000000001s)]
*  And so the overlap of all these things is where the problem definition lies. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1604.0800000000002s)]
*  If we don't think about all of these circles, we can't maximize our chance of solving that [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1609.92s)]
*  problem. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1617.44s)]
*  And so I asked this question and my whole life has really been about questions trying [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1618.16s)]
*  to figure out how to get better at asking high value questions. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1622.3200000000002s)]
*  And so I said, okay, well, I don't have expertise in these areas, but who does? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1626.4s)]
*  And I realized in the Boston area that there's like the world leaders in all of these [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1631.76s)]
*  circles. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1637.44s)]
*  And so what I did is I committed to start meeting with people and not just meeting, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1638.3200000000002s)]
*  but actually it's not just networking, forming relationships. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1642.56s)]
*  And so every two to three weeks for 10 years, I would meet with patent lawyers, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1645.92s)]
*  corporate lawyers, reimbursement, regulatory experts, manufacturing experts, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1651.6000000000001s)]
*  people in med tech, pharma, biotech, consumer health. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1655.8400000000001s)]
*  And I would look, I would meet with them. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1659.44s)]
*  I would go to all these mixers and networking events and seminars and I would go and I [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1661.68s)]
*  would ask questions and I would try to develop the skill of interacting with people and [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1665.44s)]
*  finding ways to develop relationships. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1670.0s)]
*  And what started to emerge from this was an informal advisory board for my lab. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1672.3200000000002s)]
*  And so as we're advancing projects, I can reach out to people and say, do you think [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1678.3200000000002s)]
*  this could be manufactured? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1684.0800000000002s)]
*  Are investors interested in this? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1685.8400000000001s)]
*  What would the clinical trial look like if this was to succeed? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1688.0s)]
*  What would be the comparator? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1691.52s)]
*  Because we want to include that early in our experiments to define what we're doing, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1692.88s)]
*  if it's important or not to make that the North Star. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1697.36s)]
*  And so that ended up serving this mission, this MTP, because it created this North Star [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1700.64s)]
*  that then enabled my laboratory to spin out almost every major project from my lab has [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1710.4s)]
*  spun out into a company. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1715.84s)]
*  I love this. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1717.44s)]
*  This is a master class moment for entrepreneurs here because a lot of entrepreneurs figure, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1719.3600000000001s)]
*  I need to do this myself. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1728.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1730.0800000000002s)]
*  I need to know how to do this. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1730.48s)]
*  I need to read the right book, watch the right YouTube video. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1731.8400000000001s)]
*  But in building this ecosystem around you, did you just go, was it a haphazard or were [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1735.3600000000001s)]
*  you like, I need to find a great patent lawyer and you ask around and knock on their door? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1743.28s)]
*  And then what were you offering them? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1750.8799999999999s)]
*  Was it like, hi, I'm Professor Karp. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1752.3999999999999s)]
*  I do this thing. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1754.16s)]
*  I just would love to have a conversation with you. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1755.2s)]
*  How would someone replicate that? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1757.92s)]
*  Because it's a brilliant idea. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1759.28s)]
*  So what I would do is it was very experimental. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1761.6s)]
*  It was not linear at all. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1767.28s)]
*  I just felt this gravity that I needed to do this and I didn't exactly know it would [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1768.96s)]
*  lead to this informal advisory board as it did. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1776.8s)]
*  That just kind of unfolded as I was advancing in this process. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1780.32s)]
*  But I just knew that I wasn't able to learn the expertise on my own and I had to develop [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1785.28s)]
*  relationships with people who had that expertise. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1792.0s)]
*  What I offered was I would talk to the people I was meeting about the projects that were [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1795.2s)]
*  ongoing in my laboratory and I sort of kept it open that their input could help direct [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1804.48s)]
*  the trajectory of the technologies that we were developing. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1810.96s)]
*  I think that generally humans want to work on things that are important and that can [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1816.4s)]
*  have impact. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1821.84s)]
*  So by tapping into that common energy, I was able to develop the connections around that. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1823.36s)]
*  So people kind of felt as I was meeting with them that I was taking their advice seriously [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1832.72s)]
*  and that I was going to incorporate that into the projects in my lab, which then created [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1837.68s)]
*  a connection so they wanted to follow up. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1841.9199999999998s)]
*  They wanted to see how their advice led to the next phase of the project. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1843.76s)]
*  It was a purpose-driven investment on their part. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1847.84s)]
*  I teach and speak from the mountaintops where I can. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1851.9199999999998s)]
*  Do something that's meaningful. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1857.9199999999998s)]
*  Do something that can change the world. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1859.84s)]
*  We don't need another photo sharing app. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1861.9199999999998s)]
*  The reason people follow Elon with SpaceX or with Tesla is because he's got this massive [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  transformative purpose and people want to be part of that. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1871.04s)]
*  People want meaning in their lives. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1874.0s)]
*  And so this was not a financial transaction with these folks. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1876.08s)]
*  No, it wasn't at all. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1879.76s)]
*  In fact, when I was meeting with them, it was really at the highest possible risk stage [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1882.3999999999999s)]
*  of the projects. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1887.76s)]
*  We were just beginning. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1888.3999999999999s)]
*  But I think that the people in the community also felt like not only that they were sort [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1890.7199999999998s)]
*  of felt invested in the process because I was taking their advice seriously, but there [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1897.84s)]
*  was also this potential for the future that if things started to work out that they might [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1902.48s)]
*  be able to be involved in the translation process. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1908.56s)]
*  And that's what started to happen is that as we advanced things in the lab, I kept in [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1911.52s)]
*  touch with people. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1915.76s)]
*  I sought their advice kind of over and over again. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1917.1200000000001s)]
*  And then when something got kind of ready to be translated, there was a whole bunch [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1920.48s)]
*  of people who already knew about those projects. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1925.04s)]
*  And that I felt is also one of the key things is that one of the hardest things in spinning [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1927.44s)]
*  out companies is finding a CEO who has capabilities and the network and the adaptability and [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1931.84s)]
*  the relationship component. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1940.9599999999998s)]
*  And what I realized is that when I started looking around what sort of the standard [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1943.6799999999998s)]
*  process for spinning a company out from academia was, was to push the project as far as possible [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1948.1599999999999s)]
*  and then to go find a CEO. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1952.8799999999999s)]
*  But what I discovered was if I could meet with potential entrepreneurs, potential CEOs, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1954.6399999999999s)]
*  the future companies early on involve them, then there was almost like a number of potential [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1961.12s)]
*  CEOs that I already was interacting with. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1967.84s)]
*  I already had relationships with. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1970.7199999999998s)]
*  You were circling and felt ownership. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1971.4399999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1973.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1974.3999999999999s)]
*  And feeling ownership. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1974.7199999999998s)]
*  And by the way, you're a serial entrepreneur as I am. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1975.84s)]
*  And until you find that CEO, you're the CEO and you'll get just pulled into the details [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1980.7199999999998s)]
*  and you need that amazing person. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1987.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1989.84s)]
*  I love this. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1991.9199999999998s)]
*  You mentioned the idea of your life has been about asking questions. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1994.7199999999998s)]
*  And one of the things I speak about to my kids and to the CEOs I mentor is the single [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=1998.1599999999999s)]
*  most important thing to do is ask great questions. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2002.0s)]
*  That is everything. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2004.9599999999998s)]
*  Everything. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2007.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2007.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, there's actually like maybe just three points that I can sort of shed on the questions. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2008.32s)]
*  The first is actually between the second and third grade when I had this transformational [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2016.24s)]
*  experience with the tutor who said, how did you think about that? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2022.08s)]
*  That sort of led sort of created this newfound awareness for me. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2026.0s)]
*  And I realized that when I asked questions that I couldn't really pay attention in class, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2031.1200000000001s)]
*  but anytime I asked a question, I could hyper focus for a few moments afterwards. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2037.84s)]
*  And whatever was said to me imprinted in my mind, I could connect it to other [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2042.48s)]
*  things I knew and I could recall it later. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2046.16s)]
*  And so I discovered very quickly after that moment that questions were key to my learning. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2048.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2053.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's why as I navigated my undergrad, my grad school, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2054.2400000000002s)]
*  I stopped going to a lot of my lectures and I would just focus on figuring out questions [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2058.56s)]
*  that I could ask other students or go and ask the professor. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2064.4s)]
*  You know, so questions became the key to my learning. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2069.12s)]
*  If I was in a class where I couldn't, a lot of lectures were so big that they didn't allow [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2072.88s)]
*  questions. So I stopped going to those lectures because it just, you know, I needed to ask [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2076.96s)]
*  questions. So that's like one sort of, so I discovered the discovery of questions being [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2082.08s)]
*  important was sort of like happened in elementary school. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2086.96s)]
*  But then what happened is I got into grad school and it was like, I was about to learn this, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2089.76s)]
*  this whole new avenue of asking questions, this whole new level. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2096.7200000000003s)]
*  And what happened was is that, you know, academics typically go to into seminars and you go to these [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2100.48s)]
*  invited speakers and you sit there and, you know, I started going when I entered grad school at [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2106.88s)]
*  University of Toronto. And then at the end, there's the question and answer period. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2110.8s)]
*  And people start asking questions and I was blown away by the level of questions that people are [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2114.96s)]
*  asking. And those questions weren't coming to me. And these questions were going right to the heart [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2121.28s)]
*  of what the seminar speaker was talking about. And I almost started shaming myself, like, why [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2125.76s)]
*  aren't these questions coming to me? Because I'd focused my whole life on asking questions. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2130.4s)]
*  And so I started to think, you know, what could I do to develop my skill? Because again, it's like, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2134.88s)]
*  I know that if I'm not good at something, it's because I haven't engaged the process that works [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2141.92s)]
*  for me yet. And I started to think about it. And I realized that there was potentially an opportunity [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2145.92s)]
*  for pattern recognition. So the next seminar I went to, everyone was focused on what the speaker [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2151.2s)]
*  was saying, but I was focused on something different. I was focused on the questions that [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2156.3999999999996s)]
*  were being asked. And I wrote them all down. I went to seminar after seminar, and I wrote the [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2160.56s)]
*  questions that people in the audience were asking pages and pages for like two or three months. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2166.72s)]
*  And then one day I just stopped and I looked at it. And next day, I'm looking next day, I'm just [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2171.12s)]
*  sort of thinking about it. And then boom, light bulb moment. I realized that all the questions [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2175.4399999999996s)]
*  that were being asked fit under four or five different categories. One of them was, was the [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2180.32s)]
*  experiment working? Did the person act? Did the scientists have the right controls? Right. You [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2185.6800000000003s)]
*  know, some experiments are really complicated. Another was, are the results important? So if [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2190.88s)]
*  they were developing a diagnostic for blood and they did all their work in saltwater saline and [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2195.6800000000003s)]
*  the results looked amazing, you know, it's not relevant. Exactly. And then another one was, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2199.76s)]
*  did the, did the speaker overstate their conclusions? Did the data support what they were concluding? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2206.56s)]
*  A lot of the time it actually doesn't. Then there were questions around statistics and there were [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2211.92s)]
*  some other questions. So once I had that awareness of the motivation behind asking the questions, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2215.6s)]
*  the next seminar I went to, it was like I had my detective hat on. I was taking notes. All the [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2222.0s)]
*  questions that others were asking before are now coming to me. And not only that I'm like tapped [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2226.72s)]
*  into my curiosity. Like I'm, because I'm thinking of questions, I'm, I'm also thinking of the next [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2232.24s)]
*  potential experiment that that person could perform or other applications of their work. So I'm able [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2238.3199999999997s)]
*  to tap into my creativity. And so what I realized is that questioning is a skill, regardless of [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2242.9599999999996s)]
*  where you're at, you can always, you know, move that skill forward. And I've brought that to social [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2249.2s)]
*  settings as well, where there's always like, you know, early in my life, I really struggled socially [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2255.2799999999997s)]
*  to connect with people. And so what I started to do was observe what are the people who are really [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2260.4s)]
*  good at, at connecting with people and, you know, the schmoozers and social settings, what questions [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2265.28s)]
*  are they asking? And I start listening to those questions and then I start asking those questions. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2269.76s)]
*  You're training, you're training up your neural net. Yes. Yes. It's, it's a, it's a beautiful thing. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2274.4s)]
*  You know, questions are such a powerful part of our lives. I mean, I learn, so I use questions, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2279.92s)]
*  for example, when I'm going to give a presentation, I will write out the questions that I want to ask [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2286.8799999999997s)]
*  myself and then present answering the questions I've asked myself in that structure. Right. Yeah. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2294.3199999999997s)]
*  And then for me, when I'm on stage, the most fun I ever have is in, is the Q&A that follows a keynote. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2302.08s)]
*  Right. And a lot of times I'll just forgo slides and forgo everything and just have a conversation [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2312.64s)]
*  with the audience. My favorite time is like, I'm going to say a few provocative things upfront, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2318.48s)]
*  and then I jump into the audience and I challenge them, call bullshit, tell me what you disagree [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2324.08s)]
*  with. Yeah. What are you concerned about? And just get into a conversation because it's so more, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2329.3599999999997s)]
*  unfortunately, when we go into a lecture mode, otherwise it just, you know, glosses over and [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2335.8399999999997s)]
*  people numb out. Yeah. I totally relate to that. In fact, one of the things that I like to do in [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2341.28s)]
*  my laboratory is when people are presenting data, I like them to put a title with a very bold [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2347.76s)]
*  conclusion that may even overstate the results, but that will provoke a reaction in the room. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2354.2400000000002s)]
*  So we get the best thinking to happen at that moment versus just like watching somebody, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2360.96s)]
*  you know, speak and there's no interaction. What does this mean? Right. What does the data mean in [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2366.4s)]
*  its best possible case? Yeah. I want to take you to what your massive transformative purpose is now [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2372.2400000000002s)]
*  and on the lab side, we'll talk about the book side a little bit. And what is, do you have a [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2381.2000000000003s)]
*  moonshot or a set of moonshots? Where, you know, I define a moonshot as going 10 times bigger in the [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2386.56s)]
*  world where everyone else is moving at 10%, right? Where you want to just make, you know, to use [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2391.36s)]
*  jobs as words, make a dent in the universe. What is it that drives you there? Right at this moment? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2396.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So, well, you know, really it's about the book and- And we'll come back to that, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2401.44s)]
*  but we'll focus on your science a little bit first. Yeah. Yeah. Well, for me, I feel like [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2409.2000000000003s)]
*  the moonshot is really in training and in trying to, I feel like I've spent so much time in [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2416.3199999999997s)]
*  deconstructing problem definitions and creating an ever evolving process for solving problems. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2425.92s)]
*  And I would love to bring that to the world in the most massive way possible. Interesting. So the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2434.16s)]
*  learnings that you've had in doing, in the successes you've had, you know, I was talking to Elon [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2443.36s)]
*  and once he said, you know, the design of something rounds down to zero in the process of [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2448.32s)]
*  manufacturing or making it live on. And so it's like, it's all of the processes that you've been [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2455.52s)]
*  developing that you think of as the most valuable assets you've been creating. Is that true? Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2463.92s)]
*  I think that's it. And I think a big part of that is problem definition. Like for example, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2469.92s)]
*  when I look at the XPRIZE RFAs, I'm very inspired by the problem definitions, because to me, the way [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2476.88s)]
*  to make the biggest impact in the world is to focus on problem definition. And that can then [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2484.8s)]
*  mobilize the problem solvers to come in, many who, which are not able to really define the [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2492.96s)]
*  problems, but once they see a defined problem, they can contribute their skills and their creativity [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2500.2400000000002s)]
*  to solving it. And what I see in the world is that a lot of the problems are not well defined [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2506.96s)]
*  and they're ambiguous. And so what ends up happening is that they're great sort of maybe [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2513.28s)]
*  discoveries or science that is done, but that is not translated. The goal of a lot of these [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2519.2s)]
*  initiatives is outwardly stated as translation, but yet the problem definition is not defined in [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2525.2799999999997s)]
*  a way that the problem can be solved or that you maximize potential for the solution. So I think [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2532.3999999999996s)]
*  that needs to be moved forward. I think in the entrepreneurial world, that's also defining a [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2537.4399999999996s)]
*  product market fit, becoming really clearly defined about what the market needs and what [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2543.12s)]
*  you're delivering. And, um, yeah, like one example, just, just, just to throw it out there is, is, um, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2548.96s)]
*  it's like in, in, in an academic lab, um, you know, for, for trying to think of a solution for [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2556.4s)]
*  something, we might say, okay, we're going to have a drug delivery system and we're going to put like, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2563.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, three or four different molecules to deliver in there. And each one has a purpose. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2568.48s)]
*  And this sounds really great. But then if you look at it from a translational angle, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2572.96s)]
*  that becomes extraordinarily complex. It becomes so risky to, to do. And even like, you know, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2576.32s)]
*  the clinical trial of having individual arms for each of the agents and, and there's the complexity [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2583.28s)]
*  of quality control and, you know, all of these things. And it just, to me, there's all these [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2589.12s)]
*  amazing problem solvers who are thinking that like that, that, that, that are, are missing this [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2593.52s)]
*  concept of radical simplicity for being the guard rail, the guard rails for bringing their science [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2601.84s)]
*  to, you know, to people in the most impactful, most efficient way possible. And to me that there's [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2610.64s)]
*  almost like this process, we're not formally trained in science in terms of how we could impact the [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2616.4s)]
*  world. And I think that because I've focused for many years on trying to figure that out, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2621.52s)]
*  and I'm still trying to figure it out, trying to make it more efficient. And there's always things [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2627.84s)]
*  we encounter that are big unknowns. I just feel how do we bring that process to, to the scientific [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2631.92s)]
*  community in the most, you know, most impactful way so that people can start thinking about like, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2639.92s)]
*  you know, there's a dip, like if we're going to focus, for example, on an academic sort of [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2646.32s)]
*  exploratory project, it's okay to have a 10 step synthesis to create something to test question to, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2651.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, that's fine. But if it's a translational project, and it's a 10 step synthesis, you know, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2659.28s)]
*  most of the time, that's not okay, that's gonna, that's far too complex. Now, it might be okay, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2665.6800000000003s)]
*  if you can demand you can, you know, create it, you know, get like massive investment and, you know, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2670.96s)]
*  like it just, it's still possible, but it's so risky to advance something like that. It's sort [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2677.04s)]
*  of like, okay, how do we take that stem 10 step process and turn it into one step? That's how I [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2683.2000000000003s)]
*  think you switch from exploratory to a translational project. Yeah, for sure. I want to dive down and [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2688.48s)]
*  explore one of your companies, one of your products. In fact, we've got one right here called [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2696.4s)]
*  Profi, which I love and thank you for this. What's the story behind Profi? Where did it begin? Where [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2702.32s)]
*  did this where the seed for this originate? So when COVID hit, and what is it? Yeah, when COVID hit, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2711.36s)]
*  we were developing a nasal spray to treat multiple sclerosis, there's a lot of immune cells in the [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2719.2000000000003s)]
*  nasal lining. And we had developed a platform spray that could attach to the lining of the [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2724.24s)]
*  nose, stay there for long periods of time and deliver drugs to those immune cells. And we started [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2733.7599999999998s)]
*  to get some pretty interesting results. COVID hit. And we asked this question every single project [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2739.2s)]
*  in the lab, how can we help? And we started to discover based on previous reports and some new [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2745.8399999999997s)]
*  science that was being developed, that COVID spread via droplets. They stayed in the air for [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2752.72s)]
*  long periods of time, even after someone infected left the room that these droplets. So the six foot [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2759.04s)]
*  rule was not actually going to be a valid option. Right, right. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, some [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2764.48s)]
*  arbitrariness to that to the six feet. But you know, we got to start somewhere, right? We got to put [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2769.8399999999997s)]
*  something in the ground and then and then sort of use that as a way to discover, you know, what, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2775.6s)]
*  how we might change it. So we also started to learn that COVID combined to goblet cells that [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2780.0s)]
*  are in the nasal lining. And that's a major anchor point. In fact, we started to understand that [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2786.56s)]
*  many respiratory pathogens actually anchor and get, you know, kind of take hold in the nasal lining. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2791.92s)]
*  That's the major entry point into the body. And so we started to think, okay, how can we help? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2798.08s)]
*  And we thought, okay, could we develop a three prong approach for creating a nasal spray [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2804.16s)]
*  that could effectively capture respiratory droplets that could prevent a barrier for [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2811.52s)]
*  the virus to cross the epithelium of the nasal lining? And could we also neutralize the virus [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2818.24s)]
*  and potentially bacteria when it binds to this spray? And so what we did is we also in the concept, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2825.6s)]
*  we sort of applied this concept of radical simplicity because we didn't want to include [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2834.48s)]
*  drugs in it because we knew if we put drugs in it, that it was going to take six, eight, 10 years [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2839.2799999999997s)]
*  to bring this to market. And so we said we're only the guardrails were we're only going to use [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2844.16s)]
*  agents that are on the generally recognized as safe list or have previously been used as [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2849.6s)]
*  excipients, pharmaceutical excipients in nasal sprays. And so we looked at that entire landscape [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2854.16s)]
*  and we started sort of looking at the individual components. There's preservatives in nasal sprays [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2859.8399999999997s)]
*  that can prevent bacterial growth. There's surfactants in nasal sprays. Surfactants can, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2866.24s)]
*  you know, soap is highly effective for most viruses and bacteria. If you, you know, kind of [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2871.68s)]
*  wash your hands long enough, you kill most things. And so we started to experiment, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2877.84s)]
*  you know, looking at hundreds of different combinations of agents that we thought might [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2884.08s)]
*  sort of achieve these properties. And we discovered a formulation where we got in [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2889.28s)]
*  laboratory conditions 99.99% kill of COVID-19, H1N1, influenza A and B, adenovirus, RSV, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2895.92s)]
*  E. coli and a form of pneumonia. And this was with an infectious disease researcher that we [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2904.96s)]
*  teamed up with at the Brigham. And then what we also did is we administered 10 times the lethal [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2911.52s)]
*  dose of H1N1 via nasal drops to a mouse and they all the mice, they don't do well, they all die. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2916.8s)]
*  But if we pre-administer the PROFI formulation, they all survive. And we saw minimal viral load [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2924.88s)]
*  in the lungs. That's extraordinary. So what we did is we teamed up with two regulatory advisors, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2931.12s)]
*  one Peter Hutt, who was previously the general counsel at the FDA, another regulatory advisor, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2936.88s)]
*  and then an international toxicology consulting firm. They all agreed that the agents that we had [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2943.12s)]
*  in PROFI were safe and that we could regulate this as a cosmetic. We can't make strong claims [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2948.64s)]
*  about this product, but we can talk about the science that we've conducted in the lab and the [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2955.52s)]
*  article that the science that we've been doing, we've put out into the public access so anyone can [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2960.32s)]
*  see our data and we've submitted it for peer review. So it's out for peer review right now. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2965.84s)]
*  So when did this become available? So I launched the product at the near future summit in October. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2970.48s)]
*  Amazing conference. Yes. Yeah. So October of last year. That was 23. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2979.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this sounds like what everyone should have on their shelves. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2986.24s)]
*  And I now have this. Can I just try it? For sure. Yeah. So what is happening as so what's in here? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=2993.52s)]
*  A surfactant. So we have, yeah, there's a few ingredients that are in there. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3003.92s)]
*  PROFI, everyday nasal spray. So this is actually something that you would recommend to Rose, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3009.3599999999997s)]
*  prophylactic everyday use. Yeah, I got an airplane when your kids are sick at home. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3014.48s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. Before a meeting, before you go to an event, a concert. So I take it twice a day when [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3020.2400000000002s)]
*  I get up in the morning and then midday. And, and actually we we have some data that's emerging from [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3027.04s)]
*  the lab that this may be effective for allergies as well to prevent allergens from getting so kind [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3034.32s)]
*  of creating a barrier to allergens. So the data actually is quite compelling and we're still doing [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3042.32s)]
*  some experiments to I think this is sort of a HEPA filter for your nasal cavity. I love that. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3047.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Super easy. Pleasant. Nothing negative. Yeah. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3053.84s)]
*  Yeah. It's like a gel composition. Most of it's actually water. So there's you know, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3065.84s)]
*  it's like 2% gel and other components. So, so I'm just thinking about this because it seems like [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3071.6s)]
*  this is extraordinarily simple, effective, but you can't make medical claims. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3082.24s)]
*  Well, you can't. What can you say about this? Well, what's on the box is kind of what we could [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3088.96s)]
*  say. And we're sort of experimenting with that as well. And we do have plans to, to investigate [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3093.6s)]
*  this more rigorously in people. And, you know, we're just sort of in the process. Is this, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3101.8399999999997s)]
*  is this available online or? Yeah, you can purchase it online. What's it cost, by the way? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3108.3199999999997s)]
*  It costs $20 for a month supply. So that would be two sprays a day, you know, one in each, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3112.88s)]
*  each nostril. So for 30 days or so. Yeah. I have my longevity platinum trips that I, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3121.44s)]
*  I give out products and I need to put this in everybody's bags. Yeah. Yeah. No, this is, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3127.12s)]
*  so I remember University of Washington has a protein design labs and they had been talking [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3133.76s)]
*  about a nasal spray for something that would bind the, the spike protein and disable it in that [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3142.48s)]
*  regard. But this doesn't work in that way. No, this works. I think like, you know, it's similar [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3151.28s)]
*  to how soap works essentially. So we're, we're disrupting the membranes of the, the viruses and [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3157.36s)]
*  bacteria and that can neutralize them. And so it basically reduces the load that your immune system [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3166.32s)]
*  has to, to fight. Exactly. Yeah. I kind of think of like protection in layers. So, you know, masks [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3172.0800000000004s)]
*  will provide a certain level of protection dependent on the masks. Actually, I did a lot [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3179.68s)]
*  of work with masks when, when COVID hit. I co-led this initiative to create a backup plan for N95 [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3184.0s)]
*  masks. So just in case the hospital system ran out of masks. Yeah. And we made a lot of interesting [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3192.24s)]
*  sort of observations, which is when people wear generally a surgical mask, that the mass material [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3198.24s)]
*  is quite good at filtering out COVID and other pathogens. The problem is, is that it only filters [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3204.7999999999997s)]
*  about 40 or 50% of the air because there's gaps that occur in the mass. So a lot of the air that [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3210.16s)]
*  you're breathing in and out is actually not being filtered. And that's where N95 comes in. And we [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3216.0s)]
*  actually, one of the technologies that we also developed during COVID was we developed a surgical, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3222.3199999999997s)]
*  we took a surgical mask, which is readily available and, you know, has a wire on the top. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3228.24s)]
*  We added wires to the sides and the bottom of the mask so that you can face fit it like an N95. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3232.72s)]
*  And then we created this flap on the inside. So if you cough, the flap opens up and captures the cough [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3239.8399999999997s)]
*  more efficiently. And then we put these little kind of additions here so that you could cinch the, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3245.12s)]
*  you could cinch the strap to make it tight, like to have a really good fit. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3253.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, we ran a mask competition at XPRIZE. We asked the wrong question, right? We were asking, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3257.2799999999997s)]
*  we over, we over specified because we asked for competition to design a new mask that would be [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3264.56s)]
*  more effective, manufacturable, and so forth. What we didn't ask was create a mechanism that [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3271.3599999999997s)]
*  was cheap and affordable and easy to filter out because this would have been an even better solution. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3277.68s)]
*  So your process, you found a, you floated this, you spun this out as a company, found a CEO. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3287.52s)]
*  How long was that process going from the idea to the product and then getting it launched as a company? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3296.3199999999997s)]
*  So we started working on this in 2020. So I think it was about three years for us to, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3302.3999999999996s)]
*  to, for the discovery phase, the iteration, all the experiments we did, you know, the formulation, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3310.9599999999996s)]
*  then to find a CEO, to find an angel investor in New York. So we raised a million dollars for it [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3318.8799999999997s)]
*  through a single investor. And then to find manufacturers to, you know, and, and, you know, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3326.0s)]
*  build the right model systems for testing and then to eventually launch the product. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3333.6s)]
*  Amazing. How's it doing so far? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3338.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's doing great. It's doing really great. We haven't really put much into marketing. It's [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3341.1200000000003s)]
*  more just sort of word of mouth right now. And where do people go? What website, where can they [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3346.1600000000003s)]
*  order it from? It's just profe spray.com is the, is the website. And can you get it on Amazon as [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3352.8s)]
*  well? Yeah, you can also get it on Amazon. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3360.48s)]
*  Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? If you did, did you know that besides building the atomic bomb [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3366.0s)]
*  at Los Alamos national labs, that they spent billions on bio-defense weapons, the ability [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3372.7200000000003s)]
*  to accurately detect viruses and microbes by reading their RNA? Well, a company called Viome [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3379.1200000000003s)]
*  exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos labs to build a platform that can measure [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3385.28s)]
*  your microbiome and the RNA in your blood. Now, Viome has a product that I've personally used [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3391.84s)]
*  for years called full body intelligence, which collects a few drops of your blood, spit and stool, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3396.6400000000003s)]
*  and can tell you so much about your health. They've tested over 700,000 individuals and [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3402.32s)]
*  use their AI models to deliver members critical health guidance, like what foods you should eat, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3406.96s)]
*  what foods you shouldn't eat, as well as your supplements and probiotics, your biological age, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3412.2400000000002s)]
*  and other deep health insights. And the results of the recommendations are nothing short of [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3417.76s)]

*  and I have to imagine that every biologist, every biomedical engineer, every medical [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3471.7599999999998s)]
*  technologist is seeing AI as a whole new set of tools. How do you think about AI? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3479.6s)]
*  When did you start playing? How are you incorporating it into your research and your [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3484.96s)]
*  company formation? Yeah, so AI is ... I use it more, I would say, personally than in the lab so far. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3489.28s)]
*  We do have a project in the lab where there's a platform that we've started using that takes [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3499.6800000000003s)]
*  all the omics data and allows us to mine it in a very efficient way so we can identify new targets [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3505.36s)]
*  or new molecules to target old targets. We've been using that right now in the hearing loss space [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3513.6s)]
*  to develop new therapies that can functionally restore hearing. That's an ongoing project that's [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3521.52s)]
*  early, but we're gaining momentum on that. There's a moment in time where you say, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3528.96s)]
*  we're going to go and invest time in that. What led you to focusing on hearing loss? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3533.68s)]
*  So what happened was I've always been interested in regenerative medicine and a lot of- [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3539.52s)]
*  You and I have that in common? Yes, yes. A lot of my training was in the area of mesenchymal [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3548.8s)]
*  stem cells or mesenchymal stromal cells. Would you define what that means for folks? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3558.24s)]
*  Sure. These are cells that exist pretty much in all areas of the body. There's debate over [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3563.2s)]
*  the nomenclature and how to define them, but essentially they derive from pericytes, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3572.48s)]
*  which exist on blood vessels within all tissues. They're in the bone marrow, they're in fat. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3579.2s)]
*  People might be familiar with stromal vascular fraction. They're one of the core cells that [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3586.7200000000003s)]
*  have function in that type of a therapy. These are adult stem cells that are with us for life. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3593.92s)]
*  They're very easy to isolate, to culture expand, to freeze, to administer. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3603.92s)]
*  They've actually been quite challenging to bring to market as a therapy because you can apply them [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3610.88s)]
*  both as an autologous approach as well as an allogeneic approach. Yeah, right now one of the [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3619.92s)]
*  things we're doing at my company, Fountain, in partnership with another of my company, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3625.84s)]
*  Cigularity, is we're beginning to bank adult mesenchymal stem cells and just having that [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3630.16s)]
*  on an available asset for people over time. Go on, please. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3639.44s)]
*  Mesenchymal stem cells are really interesting because they're almost like living [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3650.48s)]
*  anti-inflammatories. They have this immunomodulatory secretome that can downregulate [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3656.24s)]
*  inflammation. Inflammation is a component of pretty much every disease. There's been a lot of [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3664.72s)]
*  work that's been done to demonstrate mesenchymal stem cells have potential to treat many possible [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3673.12s)]
*  diseases, although there have been few cases where they have actually been able to be brought over [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3678.7999999999997s)]
*  the finish line in randomized placebo-controlled trials, which are in regenerative medicine very [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3685.76s)]
*  difficult trials to run because there's a massive placebo effect. In fact, I was just talking to [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3692.0s)]
*  somebody about this yesterday. One of the major trials that was done several years ago was in [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3698.6400000000003s)]
*  graft-versus-host disease, extremely debilitating from bone marrow transplantation. If you administer [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3704.48s)]
*  mesenchymal stem cells, you tend to see a very significant response, not just in the experimental [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3709.84s)]
*  group but also in the placebo group, which is amazing. Some of these trials showed over 50% [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3716.32s)]
*  response rate. Mind over body. Amazing. Amazing. I've actually been looking into that. I think that [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3722.48s)]
*  we don't fully understand the placebo effect, but one thing that really intrigued me was something [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3729.04s)]
*  I read about how when we were all hunters and gatherers 10,000 to 15,000 years ago and way [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3734.7999999999997s)]
*  before that as well, how there would be this evolutionary pressure or aspect of life where [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3741.2799999999997s)]
*  if there was a treatment developed or a ritual performed and when people believed collectively [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3750.9599999999996s)]
*  that there was going to be benefit, that that actually would have benefit. It's almost like [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3757.12s)]
*  if we believed in an outcome, if we believed in the positive potential of what was being performed, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3763.92s)]
*  even if the science wasn't there and if there wasn't a particular mechanism of action in the [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3771.84s)]
*  way that we describe it now in pharma, just the belief that something could help, there's some [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3777.44s)]
*  reason from an evolutionary perspective that that can actually work in causing us benefit. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3783.6s)]
*  And I think it's just, to me, it's like tapping into the life force that we don't fully understand [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3792.3199999999997s)]
*  it right now, but it's there. I mean, if you just look at these, it's so many incredible trials where [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3799.44s)]
*  the response rate is just massive, especially in regenerative medicine with stem cells and other [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3805.9199999999996s)]
*  types of related therapies where placebo effect is just ginormous and it makes getting experimental [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3812.0s)]
*  approaches difficult to get through medicine. And before we started speaking, you were asking [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3819.36s)]
*  about FDA and how you'd run it differently. I really think there's something there. I really think [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3823.6800000000003s)]
*  in some ways, and it's challenging, but in some ways I feel it's unfair, all of these massive [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3828.48s)]
*  placebo effects that have helped people. People are trying to weed it out instead of to amplify it. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3835.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. There's got to be a better way. And I think if we just set that as a goal, perhaps [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3841.6800000000003s)]
*  that's even an X prize to try to understand how could we actually commercialize the placebo effect. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3847.76s)]
*  One of my favorite stats that I wrote about in my longevity book was a study done with 69,000 women [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3855.84s)]
*  and 1,500 guys. One of the few studies with mostly women that showed optimists were living 15% longer [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3862.4s)]
*  than pessimists, which again is the impact of mindset. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah, because I was [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3869.92s)]
*  thinking about this this morning. I was walking along the boardwalk and I was thinking that [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3876.56s)]
*  living with a very positive mindset for some people almost seems like a fantasy. Sometimes [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3886.88s)]
*  when I've talked to other people and they say, oh, well, you're living in a fantasy world. But [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3892.08s)]
*  what struck me this morning as I was thinking about it is that it's almost the same if you're [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3896.72s)]
*  thinking negatively, right? Because often things aren't inherently negative. They're just negative [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3903.2s)]
*  in your mind. Yeah, we perceive it. We give it meaning. We are meaning making machines [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3910.3999999999996s)]
*  constantly. It's interesting that our mindsets determine what we do with a datum. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3916.08s)]
*  Either it's an attack or an opportunity. It's a scarcity or an opportunity to create and [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3924.7999999999997s)]
*  transform into abundance. Actually, just one more thing to add on that. I feel like we're at this [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3932.8s)]
*  snapshot in time, right? Snapshot in evolution where we have this survival wiring that really [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3937.44s)]
*  served us well 10, 15,000 years ago. 100,000 years ago. Right? 100,000 years ago really served us well. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3946.0s)]
*  We have the end that then with that there's like this impulsiveness. There's this kind of reactiveness [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3952.48s)]
*  very much focused on survival. But we also have this significant consciousness, this ability [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3958.56s)]
*  to leverage our prefrontal cortex, our neuroplasticity to be able to plan, emotionally [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3965.52s)]
*  regulate. We can actually decrease the size of our amygdala through practicing rituals that [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3972.2400000000002s)]
*  allow us to be more mindful and in a relaxed state. I feel like over time what doesn't serve [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3981.6s)]
*  us well, this impulsivity, this survival wiring, will evolve out. But we're not at that point yet. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3988.64s)]
*  It's kind of up to us individually to have strategies in our life where we can really tap [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=3994.96s)]
*  into our prefrontal cortex. Neuroplasticity, our brains are constantly rewiring regardless of what [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4000.72s)]
*  we're doing. But we can actually be intentional about that rewiring by using the conscious part [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4006.96s)]
*  of our brains. I think it's through rituals and practices that we can actually tap into that. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4012.48s)]
*  I love that. Our default wiring is fear and scarcity because that would save us 100,000 years [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4017.84s)]
*  ago. Fear and scarcity doesn't work for us today. It puts you in a very bad situation, a bad place. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4025.28s)]
*  I think actively choosing your mindset and shaping. The way we do this is our [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4032.0s)]
*  brains are neural nets and you shape a neural net by showing it example after example after example. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4036.56s)]
*  If you're willing to take the time like you've been doing to say, I'm going to, and this is some [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4043.7599999999998s)]
*  of the work I do in a program I've been developing called Mindset Mastery, which is I want people to [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4050.16s)]
*  develop a purpose-driven mindset, a abundance mindset, a longevity mindset, a moonshot mindset, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4055.68s)]
*  because these are the mindsets that are going to serve us, a curiosity mindset. I love that. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4062.96s)]
*  We can actively shape our mindsets and it's the differentiator between success and failure and [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4070.7200000000003s)]
*  happiness and sadness and all of the things that we care about. Interestingly enough, genetically, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4077.12s)]
*  we're very similar to hominids 20, 30, 40,000 years ago. You could probably grab a population, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4085.6s)]
*  put them through our educational system and have some percentage go to MIT and Harvard, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4093.92s)]
*  but society is what's been shifting. I think we need to be very careful about how [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4100.08s)]
*  the societal overlay is being shaped going forward. What do you think about that? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4108.96s)]
*  Well, I think that it's an indulgence to live in negativity. Interesting. I think that, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4114.4800000000005s)]
*  because the negativity often is the default mode for most people if you listen to conversations [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4123.2s)]
*  in coffee shops or restaurants or- Yes. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4127.92s)]
*  Right? Yeah, for sure. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4130.32s)]
*  And I feel like it's an indulgence- Or the media who just abuses your amygdala for their own- [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4131.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4138.56s)]
*  Their own financial benefit. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4139.04s)]
*  Absolutely. And to that point, I think that, and going back to AI, one of the thoughts that [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4140.400000000001s)]
*  I've been having is that technology can impact our brains, not just functionally, but also [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4148.320000000001s)]
*  the structure of our brains. And so the hippocampus, the gray matter can densify [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4157.92s)]
*  or we can reduce the density dependent on what media we engage, what we consume, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4164.64s)]
*  what technologies we embrace. And I think that we need to study more how technology not only [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4170.240000000001s)]
*  impacts the function of our brains and the rewiring of our brains, but also how it impacts the [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4177.200000000001s)]
*  structure of parts of our brains like the amygdala, like our hippocampus, and use that [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4182.240000000001s)]
*  as potentially biometrics for how we move technology forward. And I think that [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4190.080000000001s)]
*  what really strikes me is that I like to think about what am I up against in society. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4196.4800000000005s)]
*  And to me, there's two things that really stand out. One is $900 billion every year with a B [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4201.68s)]
*  is spent on marketing and advertising to hijack our attention and to serve us what's important. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4208.64s)]
*  And the algorithms that were served and who's ever behind the algorithms is essentially [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4214.72s)]
*  controlling us. And one of the major reasons is because the second thing that we spoke a little [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4220.88s)]
*  bit about that we're up against is this wiring that we have, this primitive wiring for survival [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4225.92s)]
*  that where our brains also another component of that is our brains gravitate to a low energy brain [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4233.2s)]
*  state and our bodies gravitate to a low energy body state. It would not have made sense to exercise [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4238.4s)]
*  15,000 years ago because we were outside working hard to survive. And even our brains, it wouldn't [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4245.92s)]
*  have made sense to engage in things that would diminish our cognitive capacity. We need to keep [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4251.44s)]
*  that open for survival scenarios, deplete resources to problem solve and figure out a way to survive. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4259.04s)]
*  It was all about survival. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4266.639999999999s)]
*  And so these two things, when you bring them together, what happens is that if you don't [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4267.84s)]
*  have rituals and practices in your life to really activate your conscious part of your brain, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4273.04s)]
*  then you essentially just become robots. And so as you serve technology, people are served [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4279.5199999999995s)]
*  technology. I think that's one of the biggest challenges is that the people developing [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4284.96s)]
*  technologies, we really need to deeply understand and every day remind ourselves that when we serve [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4289.36s)]
*  this technology to humanity, the majority of people who are not engaged in rituals and practices to [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4297.599999999999s)]
*  activate their conscious brain are just going to be robots and do whatever they're told. Whatever [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4304.88s)]
*  the algorithms are served to them, they're just going to live those algorithms. And we need to [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4311.44s)]
*  start to better understand what the consequences of that are. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4316.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think that is potentially one of the benefits that AI could serve [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4319.28s)]
*  as a warning system for you. So one of the things along this lines is we develop these cognitive [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4326.799999999999s)]
*  biases because our brain cannot process the amount of information coming our way. So we are reactive. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4332.5599999999995s)]
*  We have 100 cognitive biases, familiarity bias, recency bias, negativity bias, and these biases [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4339.679999999999s)]
*  basically allow us to make very quick snap judgments and not use the precious resources of our [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4350.0s)]
*  100 million nerves in our cognitive capacity. But I want an AI that I can turn on to say, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4358.16s)]
*  Peter, you're being manipulated, you're being used, you're being lied to, you're over weighting [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4372.32s)]
*  information from this person because you like the way they look or because they've gotten the [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4381.04s)]
*  same school as you, but the reality is let's look at this information over here. So I mean, there's [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4388.8s)]
*  the countervailing force that could be offered by AI. I think of Jarvis as my AI [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4395.28s)]
*  wraparound, that is my interface with the world. If you want to, if you want to. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4401.92s)]
*  I want to dive as we close out into your book Lit. We got a little bit of its origin [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4409.28s)]
*  in your childhood, but what's the, let's jump into that. Why do you write it? What's its message? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4417.759999999999s)]
*  Please. So I wrote Lit because my life has really been a living laboratory and I have developed a [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4427.2s)]
*  lot of tools and strategies to navigate all sorts of scenarios and I really wanted to share those [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4436.88s)]
*  tools with the world. That's really the kind of the origin motivation for writing Lit. My wife [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4443.68s)]
*  reminded me that even when we met in over 20 years ago, I carried around a little book and would just [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4451.92s)]
*  write thoughts that came to me kind of like journaling, but more like around like processes, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4458.400000000001s)]
*  really focused on tools and things that were coming to me on a daily basis. And so that's [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4465.2s)]
*  kind of the origin of Lit, but it evolved and I interviewed 40 people, including Nobel Prize [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4471.5199999999995s)]
*  winners and Olympic medalists and social justice leaders and indigenous leader and astronauts and [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4478.16s)]
*  people from my laboratory and really just started to ask questions around how do you be intentional? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4485.2s)]
*  How do you make deliberate decisions in your lives? How do you intercept patterns? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4492.48s)]
*  And were these questions the same for every person you interviewed? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4498.32s)]
*  They were different. Yeah, different. And just sort of looking for stories to tell in Lit [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4501.759999999999s)]
*  that might connect with different audiences and resonate with people in different ways. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4509.839999999999s)]
*  So share a few of your favorite stories. Sure. So, well, one of the [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4516.0s)]
*  people that I interviewed, Nelson Dellis, five times US memory champion. I could use that. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4522.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think we all could use that. So he spoke about how when he was younger, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4528.48s)]
*  he didn't have a good memory at all. He wasn't able to memorize things and it didn't come easy [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4533.84s)]
*  to him. Someone in his family developed Alzheimer's and that really created a pain point for him to [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4538.24s)]
*  find ways to improve his memory. And so he was motivated and he sort of practiced a number of [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4544.88s)]
*  different techniques. One that he landed on is called the memory palace, where essentially [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4551.76s)]
*  you envision, let's say a house that, a cheer childhood home and you have a deck. A lot of the [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4556.4800000000005s)]
*  stuff he does is with a deck of cards. And so he, someone will give him a deck that's completely, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4562.08s)]
*  you know, randomly shuffled and he will go through and look at the cards and I forget the exact time, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4567.2s)]
*  but it's like in a minute and whatever he can memorize a complete deck of cards. And so maybe [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4574.64s)]
*  it's like 40 seconds or I forget what the exact number is. But and so what you do is you assign [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4581.2s)]
*  a card for each person in your life. So like his mom might be like the queen of hearts and his dad, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4586.88s)]
*  the king of diamonds. And so he based on what he sees with the cards, he'll walk through his house [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4593.04s)]
*  and sort of, you know, put the card in different rooms in different picture frames and stuff. So [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4598.16s)]
*  anyhow, he talked about how he got better and better and better at it. And I asked him about [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4603.36s)]
*  the monotony of that process and how did he, you know, practicing can get very boring at times and [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4611.12s)]
*  hard to bring yourself to practicing. And he said that he, you know, he talked about a variety of [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4617.36s)]
*  techniques that he used to bring in fresh energy into that, like, you know, by adding, like mixing [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4621.28s)]
*  things up or adding cards in or taking cards out, or like, he just had ways of kind of changing it [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4627.5199999999995s)]
*  up. So it would always create, you know, be interesting and intriguing for him. Is that a [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4632.5599999999995s)]
*  beginner's mind that you speak about? I think it's the beginner's mind. Yeah. Yeah. I've been [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4637.12s)]
*  actually reading a lot about the beginner's mind recently. And so anyhow, what happened was he [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4641.28s)]
*  tells this story about how he had gone, tried to climb Everest twice and failed to reach the [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4645.92s)]
*  summit both times. And he trained again for a third time and he was on his way up. He went into the [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4651.04s)]
*  death zone where, you know, oxygen levels are so low, you can't survive for very long. He was able [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4656.24s)]
*  to memorize a deck of cards in under a minute in the death zone. And because he was practicing the [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4660.72s)]
*  cards, he realized as he continued to kind of make his way up that he didn't, he wasn't going [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4666.48s)]
*  to be able to make it the third time, even though he had failed two previous attempts, even though [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4672.5599999999995s)]
*  he had trained for it and he really wanted to make it, that his ability to, you know, that the [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4676.719999999999s)]
*  process of engaging in this, this memory work as he went up made it like he was cognitively sharp [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4683.2s)]
*  at that moment and was able to convince himself to turn back and survive. And there's a ridiculously [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4689.44s)]
*  high, you know, mortality rate in going after Everest. Yeah. So that's one, one, you know, story [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4696.32s)]
*  that I just found really fascinating. Another, Joyce Roche was an executive at, at Avon and she [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4702.96s)]
*  had worked her way up the corporate ladder and she described how she had really debilitating [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4712.24s)]
*  imposter syndrome. She just couldn't figure out how she made it that far. She never felt like she [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4720.16s)]
*  was, you know, she, she just, she, she, she wasn't really tapped into what she had brought to the [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4725.76s)]
*  company and somebody in her, someone was up for a promotion and it sort of created a pain point [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4730.96s)]
*  because she was like, wait, I should have that promotion. For some reason she was like, just, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4738.4800000000005s)]
*  just used to progressing. Yeah. She was just used to progressing, but then someone was up for [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4742.72s)]
*  promotions. She thought, well, I, I'm, you know, that felt like she felt like she should have that. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4746.400000000001s)]
*  And so what she did is she went home and she did some deep thinking and she basically like [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4750.88s)]
*  journaled on what her, what, what, what, what the value that she had brought to Avon and what was [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4757.04s)]
*  holding her back. And she started to realize through writing out all the valuable things that [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4766.0s)]
*  she had brought, that she was indeed qualified for this position and that she really was deserving [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4771.6s)]
*  of it. And that prompted her to really be able to break free from this imposter syndrome, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4777.2s)]
*  advocate for herself and get that promotion. And, and she told a number of stories around how that [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4783.44s)]
*  was just really empowering for her. And I think to me, it was just so fascinating because a lot [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4789.599999999999s)]
*  of people suffer from imposter syndrome. And I think that in many ways, I think it's connected [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4794.16s)]
*  to the beginner's mind. I think it's connected there because we engage in a lot of things in [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4798.8s)]
*  our life. Like I feel like, I feel most of the things I do, I'm not qualified to do, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4804.72s)]
*  but that actually maximizes my chance of bringing value to it because I'm focused on what's most [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4810.64s)]
*  important. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting, right? I remember always thinking, um, there's gotta be [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4817.52s)]
*  somebody who's much more of an adult leading the stuff than we are. Right. But you find out [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4823.04s)]
*  that's not the case. How many total stories do you tell in the book? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4828.88s)]
*  So there's 40, 40 stories of people that I interviewed, and then there's a bunch of my own [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4836.0s)]
*  stories as well. And, and to me, you know, lit lit is really about resensitizing our aliveness. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4843.12s)]
*  It's about intercepting patterns and algorithms and thinking about your thinking, thinking about [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4850.48s)]
*  thinking. That is the core of it. You know, it's interesting. I talk about this a lot that, um, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4856.48s)]
*  that people don't stop to think about their thinking enough. And the other side of the equation is we [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4862.16s)]
*  don't know how to think other than the way we know how to think. Yeah. Which is an interesting [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4867.5199999999995s)]
*  question. So one of the things I love using large language models about is this is what I'm doing. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4872.16s)]
*  This is the challenge I'm having. How would Steve Jobs solve this or how would someone else, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4879.76s)]
*  you know, so it's interesting that you can use even within a company within your board or your [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4886.56s)]
*  leadership team, uh, you're limited by the cognitive experiences and react, you know, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4891.76s)]
*  thinking that that's within that corpus of individuals. But if you can bring in external, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4899.04s)]
*  this is where you bring in consultants and disruptors and so forth, but large language [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4905.44s)]
*  models can play that role for you too. Neurodiversity and just diversity in general [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4908.799999999999s)]
*  powers evolution. Right? If everything was the same, everything would have become extinct. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4913.04s)]
*  And I think that that's the case for, for everything that the diversity of thought, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4918.799999999999s)]
*  the ability to switch between different frames of reference, the ability to look at things through [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4924.719999999999s)]
*  different lenses. Um, and, uh, you know, one of the CEOs that I've worked with, I think made [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4930.24s)]
*  him such an incredible CEO is that on the scientific advisory board, he populated it with the most [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4937.44s)]
*  critical scientists he possibly could in all the potential areas where there were holes in the [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4944.24s)]
*  story. And so it's about trying to look at things from different angles to, to be able to kind of [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4949.76s)]
*  put the ego aside and be able to consider the different perspectives, the different views. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4956.8s)]
*  And to me, that's also what makes life so incredible is that there's so many different [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4964.8s)]
*  ways of being so many different ways of experiencing the world, different ways of [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4971.2s)]
*  questioning and doing things. And when you're with somebody who does something different or [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4975.04s)]
*  thinks differently, it's an opportunity to contrast that with your process and to discover [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4980.5599999999995s)]
*  whether it is what is your process really working optimally for you, or is it time to try on another? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4986.799999999999s)]
*  But there, therein lies some challenges because you have to be willing. You know, it's, uh, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4992.32s)]
*  I know a lot of people, including myself, sometimes I'm so sure of how I'm doing what I just don't want [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=4998.879999999999s)]
*  someone to tell me a different approach, right? It's like time is marching along. I have a limited [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5005.12s)]
*  amount of resources, money, whatever it might be. And I'm just like, no, we're going down this road. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5011.599999999999s)]
*  I look at everything on a pendulum. So I kind of think that like everything's a pendulum swing, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5016.72s)]
*  right? And so I feel like there's times where, you know, for me, like, I'm really certain about [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5021.28s)]
*  the approach. And then there's times where I'm considering all kinds of different frames of [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5026.5599999999995s)]
*  reference. And I feel like that pendulum, it's like almost like a pendulum for everything is [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5030.32s)]
*  constantly kind of moving back and forth. And so in life, I just, you know, I've heard a lot, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5034.32s)]
*  you know, you want to strike balance, but to me, it's more, you want to have awareness of where you [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5038.96s)]
*  are in the pendulum swing and you want to sort of be intentional of like, okay, that's where I want [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5044.08s)]
*  it to be, or do I want it to be more center or do I want it to be over here? I mean, it could be [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5049.84s)]
*  for an entrepreneur, for a leader, for anyone trying to make a difference that well, for mom [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5054.48s)]
*  and a dad to, I mean, just being, taking the time to understand that, understand your processes [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5057.84s)]
*  and your thinking and be conscious, right? And not reacting. That's, that is a huge, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5064.64s)]
*  oh my God, that's everything. Yeah. And I recognize that with my family, my interactions with my [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5071.68s)]
*  family. And, and, you know, there was times where I became a workaholic, I became addicted to the [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5076.400000000001s)]
*  dopamine hits that I was getting from my work. And I really needed to change my way of being. And I [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5081.28s)]
*  got into experimenting with meditation and various mindfulness strategies. And I started [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5086.48s)]
*  to realize that when I was interacting with family members, that there was an energy of the [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5091.759999999999s)]
*  conversation. Like, let's say if I'm having a conversation with my son, for example, it's like, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5096.32s)]
*  if he's speaking about something, I have an urge to intercept, to show, Hey, take a look at this on [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5101.04s)]
*  my phone. Or, or I try to say something. And I realized that I take the energy from him and I [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5106.879999999999s)]
*  put it on me that he stopped speaking and that that's not what I want. Like what my intention is [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5112.16s)]
*  to support him and what he's saying and for him to find his voice and to continue speaking. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5118.8s)]
*  And so to me, that's one of the things that I've been working on is to really in a conversation, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5124.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, I used to interest in interject all the time, because I was, you know, with ADHD, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5130.24s)]
*  I lose my train of thought, I want to say it, I want to get it out there. But I realized that, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5135.2s)]
*  you know, other thoughts will come and that's fine. And, you know, things go, things come, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5139.84s)]
*  things go. But I want to, my intention is to support the people that I'm interacting with and [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5144.0s)]
*  to create the right, you know, environment for deep connections. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxB4_NjVHU&t=5152.320000000001s)]
