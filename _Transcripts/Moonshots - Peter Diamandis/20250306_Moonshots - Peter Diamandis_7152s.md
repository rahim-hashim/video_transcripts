*  This new human civilization that's coming into being, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=26.68s)]
*  is it going to be human? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=29.36s)]
*  Is it going to be civilized? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=30.52s)]
*  I've never seen equality in my life until now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=31.64s)]
*  99% of black kids don't know anything about AI. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=34.32s)]
*  99% of white kids don't either. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=36.64s)]
*  Nigeria is going to boom. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=38.52s)]
*  Ghana is going to boom. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=40.36s)]

*  We're in danger of creating a human civilization [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  that has an awful lot of data and very little wisdom. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=48.04s)]
*  That's the reason why I'm not worried about AI, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  because it's going to unlock that superhuman. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  I don't think people are prepared [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=55.6s)]
*  for how fast things are going to change. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=56.96s)]
*  Now that's the moonshot, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=59.24s)]
*  I think most of you know that the news media [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  is delivering negative news to us all the time, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=69.28s)]
*  because we pay 10 times more attention to negative news [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=71.36s)]
*  than positive news. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=74.6s)]
*  For me, the only news worthwhile that's true [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  and impacting humanity is the news of science and technology. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=79.4s)]
*  That's what I pay attention to. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=83.56s)]
*  And every week I put out two blogs, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=85.12s)]
*  one on AI and exponential tech and one on longevity. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  If this is of interest to you [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  and it's available totally for free, please join me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=92.48s)]

*  Perhaps the most compelling thinker [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=115.36s)]
*  on the convergence of technology, culture and education. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=117.92s)]
*  Just to hear him speak about the way he thinks around AI [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=121.08s)]
*  and technology and the world about us is a beautiful thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=124.28s)]

*  working at the intersection of media, technology and justice. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=135.84s)]
*  We're gonna be talking about the impact of AI [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=139.88s)]
*  on creating a true meritocracy in the world. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=142.32s)]
*  And how do we use AI to uplift every man, woman and child [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=145.28s)]
*  in the global South, in Africa, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=148.6s)]
*  and how we make AI something that enables us [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=151.08s)]
*  to create a world where we're not bombarded [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=154.6s)]
*  by the negative news. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=157.08s)]

*  about why the news is so negative. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=165.04s)]
*  Let's jump into this conversation [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=167.24s)]
*  with two incredible visionary individuals. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=168.64s)]
*  Hey guys, welcome. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  Hi. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=172.08s)]
*  Let's see, last time I saw you, Van, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  was at Google Zeitgeist. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=175.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=177.16s)]
*  And we kicked off not only just a partnership, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=178.0s)]
*  but a friendship. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=180.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=180.96s)]
*  And it was awesome. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=181.8s)]
*  I've been recommending your book, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=183.16s)]
*  The Future is Faster Than You Think, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=185.12s)]
*  to literally everybody. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=186.72s)]
*  And I didn't know you were gonna be there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=188.32s)]
*  I come around the corner and there's Peter Diamandis. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=190.24s)]
*  I was like, holy crap. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=192.0s)]
*  So no, it's been extraordinary to get a chance [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=194.96s)]
*  to have my team and your team working together [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=198.24s)]
*  to get these exponential thinking concepts out [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=200.24s)]
*  to folks who just have missed the memo, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=203.88s)]
*  but who are wide open. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=206.96s)]
*  And I tell you, one thing that's amazing is, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  folks from communities that have been overlooked [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  or underestimated, disruption is great for them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=214.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's a chance to catch up. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a chance to catch up. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=220.08s)]
*  It's like, we're gonna disrupt the status quo, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=220.92000000000002s)]

*  you were in the ancient Greek stadium in Athens [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  for the first global, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=235.44s)]
*  and you were blasting at 2 billion decibels. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=237.76s)]
*  Yeah, that was magical. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=240.92s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  We just announced Panama. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=244.68s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=246.48s)]
*  So Panama will be this year for the robotics. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=247.32s)]

*  He's the grand poobah of FIRST, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=258.04s)]
*  but here, Will, you have been one of the greatest amplifiers. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=260.68s)]
*  How many teams do you fund? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  Over 500, and we serve about 15,000 students [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=270.52000000000004s)]

*  When we started in 2008, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=290.56s)]
*  that the world will be more technological, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=292.8s)]

*  that will change how we work, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=306.12s)]
*  how we do pretty much everything. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=308.56s)]
*  Yeah, how we're parents, how we raise our kids, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=312.48s)]
*  how we govern our nation's everything. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=315.76s)]
*  Every single industry is gonna change. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=318.48s)]
*  One thing is I don't think people are prepared [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  for how fast things are gonna change. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=323.24s)]
*  Will, you've been at the front end building companies [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=327.8s)]
*  and building technology to enable creatives [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=330.28s)]
*  to use this tech to become more creative [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=335.76s)]
*  and to go faster and deeper and bigger and global. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=339.88s)]
*  And that's been beautiful. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=343.56s)]
*  I grabbed two quotes from each of you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=346.04s)]
*  that I thought was really powerful. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=348.32000000000005s)]
*  And Van, this is the one I heard, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=350.32000000000005s)]
*  and I've tweeted and I've told everybody about it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=352.0s)]
*  And I heard you say this at Zeitgeist, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  at Google Zeitgeist, and it's, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  AI is not a hand grenade that blows up your life. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=358.88000000000005s)]
*  It's a jet pack to set you free. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, certainly we choose it to be that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=365.24s)]
*  It definitely can be that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=368.12s)]
*  One of the things about Will.i.am, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  I never heard of AI except [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  it's sort of maybe some abstract science fiction stuff. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=376.36s)]
*  And so he asked me to come over to FYI, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  which is here in Los Angeles. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=384.0s)]
*  And it's kind of like this incredible beehive [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=385.44s)]
*  of activity and creatives and artists [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=387.48s)]
*  and technological people. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=389.88s)]
*  And he sat me down and showed me his AI. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=391.88s)]
*  And this was four or five years ago. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=394.92s)]
*  I saw an early, early version on your phone. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=398.92s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like, what, what, what, what? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  I was like, I thought you're gonna hit me [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=404.16s)]
*  with a new beat or something. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=406.52s)]
*  Hit me with a new beat in human civilization. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=407.76s)]
*  I'm like, what the hell? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=410.6s)]
*  So- [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=412.08s)]
*  Will builds hardware and software. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=412.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=415.04s)]
*  And so that really, I mean, I had the chance to, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  I did Yes We Code, working with Prince, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=420.72s)]
*  just trying to get some of his basic coding stuff going. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=423.48s)]
*  But he had gone to a completely different level. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=427.72s)]
*  And it's just remarkable. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=430.36s)]
*  And so now people are beginning to catch up [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=432.92s)]
*  to the beginning of his first sentence. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=436.36s)]
*  And he's like three trilogies later on his own journey. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=438.6s)]
*  Definitely, right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=442.8s)]
*  I mean, you're five, six years solidly into this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=443.64000000000004s)]
*  And you just started your podcast with your AI co-host. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=446.92s)]
*  What's your AI co-host name? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=450.72s)]
*  So yeah, the first persona agent that we built [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=453.32000000000005s)]
*  was Fiona. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=456.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=458.04s)]
*  And now we have, just based on FYI, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=458.88s)]
*  we're gonna run out of F names. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=462.0s)]
*  So we have Fiona, Felicia, Fiera, Finn, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=464.88s)]
*  yeah, Phillip, Felix, this guy named Fito. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=472.2s)]
*  Fito is like ultra, like expressive. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=477.36s)]
*  The same with Felicia. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=481.6s)]
*  Felicia is like the most colorful, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  expressive agent that we have. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=485.44s)]
*  And we moved out of Fs. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=487.72s)]
*  Now we have Mr. K for... [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=490.56s)]
*  It's like men in black here. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=494.6s)]
*  Yeah, so Mr. K is in collaboration [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=496.12s)]
*  with our partnership with LG. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  LG, Mr. K is Korean. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=501.92s)]
*  All things South Korea, K-pop. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  But it's a LG agent persona. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  Because we're deploying our AI on their speakers [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=512.28s)]
*  and eventually TVs. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=515.4s)]
*  And then we have other partners [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  that we're about to announce. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=523.16s)]
*  But yeah, so Fiona was the first agent persona [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=524.8s)]
*  that we built. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=527.68s)]
*  You imagine everybody's gonna end up having [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=528.52s)]
*  their buddies, friends as AI agents. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=531.9599999999999s)]
*  You're most close confidant. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=536.28s)]
*  I mean, the first AI agent version [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=537.8s)]
*  I've ever heard of, my favorite, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=539.76s)]
*  is Jarvis from Iron Man. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  Jarvis is there. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=544.56s)]
*  Jarvis takes you from wherever you are [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=545.84s)]
*  to wherever you wanna go. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=550.52s)]
*  It's a jet pack. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=552.4s)]
*  It's leveling the playing field. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=553.88s)]
*  And since Iron Man is part of the Avengers, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=556.36s)]
*  let's go there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=559.36s)]
*  You came forward with an idea called Make Wakanda Real. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=561.2s)]
*  Yes, that was good. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=564.88s)]
*  I like how you did that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=566.92s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=568.4s)]
*  Smooth, smooth, smooth? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=569.7199999999999s)]
*  He's smooth? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  That was smooth. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=571.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=572.4s)]
*  And listen, there's no one smoother than you, my friend. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=573.24s)]
*  No, I was like, wow. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=576.4399999999999s)]
*  That works, that works. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  That was nice how you did that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=580.12s)]
*  So for those who haven't heard of your program, your effort, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  what is it and why are you doing it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=586.7199999999999s)]
*  Because it's gonna set the basis for this whole conversation. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=589.28s)]
*  Well, Will.i.am is so far ahead of, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=593.04s)]
*  like humanity in a lot of ways [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=598.0799999999999s)]
*  in terms of his ability to bring culture, art, spirituality, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  of political consciousness, technology. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=605.9599999999999s)]
*  And then when you take a step back from him, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=609.0s)]
*  there's a big gulf in terms of what's going on [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=612.52s)]
*  in the black community [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=615.56s)]
*  and the kind of conversations that's going on. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=616.88s)]
*  And so for me, I thought it was really important [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=619.04s)]
*  since we have someone who's already such a pioneer, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=621.16s)]
*  how do you get other people at least engaging [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=624.24s)]
*  in the conversation? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=628.8s)]
*  Well, luckily Wakanda, which is, you know, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=629.64s)]
*  in the Marvel superhero universe, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=632.92s)]
*  it's a black African nation [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=636.0s)]
*  that is the most technologically advanced in the world. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=638.24s)]
*  They're using technology for good. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=641.3199999999999s)]
*  They're a heroic country. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=643.12s)]
*  They also have culture. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, this, I said, we should use this metaphor [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  as an answer back to the despair, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=649.92s)]
*  an answer back to the loss of hope. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  The feeling of being left behind. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=656.16s)]
*  And a reality of being left behind in a lot of ways [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=657.76s)]
*  where, you know, we're past Obama. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=662.4s)]
*  You know, it's not a hope and change kind of moment. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=665.76s)]
*  And there's a lot of people who are really giving up [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=668.0s)]
*  a politics of resentment in the black community, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=670.48s)]
*  a politics of despair in the black community. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=673.12s)]
*  And how do you fix that? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=676.36s)]
*  Well, you gotta fix it with hope, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=677.28s)]
*  but it's gotta be hope that has something to do with today. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=678.8s)]
*  And so about a year and a half ago, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=681.92s)]
*  we said, well, why don't we go to FYI [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=685.24s)]
*  where I got my brain blown open with all this stuff [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=687.16s)]
*  and just bring the whole community there. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=690.2s)]
*  And he opened the doors and we had a simple event [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=692.28s)]
*  called Make Wakanda Real. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=695.96s)]
*  And it was an amazing thing. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=697.72s)]
*  You know, several hundred people showed up [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=700.04s)]
*  in the community. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=701.52s)]
*  We could not get them to leave. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=702.72s)]
*  And it was, and this guy breaks out in the middle of, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=705.0s)]
*  you know, we're doing our talk, our interview, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  and with giving me no notice as usual, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=710.88s)]
*  he just pulls out his phone. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=713.28s)]
*  And the persona on his phone starts, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=714.96s)]
*  they start having a debate and arguments [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=718.12s)]
*  and the people's jaws are hanging on the ground. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=719.92s)]
*  Nobody ever seen anything like this before. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=722.48s)]
*  I think I've seen the video clip. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=723.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=725.04s)]
*  And it really started something. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=725.88s)]
*  So now we have this whole movement now [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=729.16s)]
*  that came out of a Will.i.am shop. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=730.5600000000001s)]

*  when the next episode is being dropped. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=752.5999999999999s)]
*  All right, back to our episode. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=754.8399999999999s)]
*  So Will, take it a step further. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=756.92s)]
*  What's your, what success look like for this effort [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=758.8399999999999s)]
*  in five years time? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=762.88s)]
*  I don't think anybody can predict 10 years, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=764.64s)]
*  but five years maybe. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  That's a deep one. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=767.4s)]
*  First we have to like address growth [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=769.4s)]
*  and what's actually happening on the continent of Africa [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=775.72s)]
*  and what's not happening on the continent of Africa. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=780.84s)]
*  But this is beyond just Africa. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  This is inner city youth in LA, in Atlanta. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=784.8s)]
*  Yeah, but. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=787.88s)]
*  Every place, right? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=788.72s)]
*  Yeah, but Make Wakanda Real is based on this Wakanda. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=789.56s)]
*  Yes, okay. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=794.52s)]
*  And this growth that's happening on earth in Africa. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=795.8s)]
*  The majority of youth on earth is in Africa. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=801.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=806.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's 2040, 2050, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=807.8399999999999s)]
*  the majority of the folks that are, you know, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=811.3599999999999s)]
*  leading companies, working at companies, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=815.52s)]
*  because of the youth population in Africa [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=819.92s)]
*  is gonna be African. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=822.3599999999999s)]
*  I think people don't realize demographics here. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=823.5999999999999s)]
*  And I just wanna take a second to address that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=826.4399999999999s)]
*  We've got China has been a dominant player. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=828.28s)]
*  India has overtaken China in terms of the largest nation [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=833.76s)]
*  on the planet with now 1.41 billion people. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=836.64s)]
*  The majority of the world putting Africa aside [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=839.7199999999999s)]
*  is in a retrenchment mode. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=842.3599999999999s)]
*  The population is dropping throughout the rest of Asia, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=843.92s)]
*  most of Europe, the US and so forth. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=847.4s)]
*  And I've said this before, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=850.64s)]
*  I think India is gonna surpass China. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=852.04s)]
*  And then what surpasses that ultimately is Africa. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=854.4s)]
*  Because of Africa's youth, because of its resources. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=858.08s)]
*  Those two things together give it sort of this demographics [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=861.6s)]
*  and destiny. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=865.44s)]
*  So when you put that into the context, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=866.28s)]
*  Make Wakanda Real is what? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=871.2s)]
*  So that means 2060, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=873.44s)]
*  a lot of people are gonna look half black, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=878.08s)]
*  half Chinese, half black, half Indian, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=881.3199999999999s)]
*  which is awesome. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=884.92s)]
*  It's a beautiful mix. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=886.76s)]
*  So that collaboration that's going to help Africa boom [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=889.4s)]
*  is that China Africa, it's already happening. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=893.6s)]
*  This is the, what do you call it? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=896.6s)]
*  The Belt and Road Program in China. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=898.48s)]
*  It's already happening. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=902.1999999999999s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=903.6s)]
*  Is it India and Africa? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  That's gonna be an amazing collaboration. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=907.16s)]
*  Is it African-American Africa? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=910.2s)]
*  And that's what Make Wakanda Real is for African-Americans. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=915.48s)]
*  Barring from a Disney film on the Black Panthers, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=919.0400000000001s)]
*  which in America, the Black Panthers were like, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=925.6s)]
*  donezoed by American infiltration. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=928.08s)]
*  That's interesting, right? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=931.88s)]
*  So just using these metaphors. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=933.08s)]
*  Time has dulled that one down [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  and the Avengers has brought Black Panther [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  to have a positive connotation. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  So you see that, I started there to show you [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=946.16s)]
*  where Africa is the continent. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=949.8s)]
*  Then there's the Congo. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  So if there was a mineral, a rare mineral, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=955.16s)]
*  that is metaphorically like that car, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=958.64s)]
*  with vibranium, it's what's happening in the Congo now. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=962.24s)]
*  So that metaphor is not like, you know. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=965.2s)]
*  It's not a huge stretch, it's real. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  It's pretty real. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=971.76s)]
*  For those who don't know, I mean, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=972.96s)]
*  you're mining various elements and minerals in the Congo [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=974.08s)]
*  that are required for your cell phone, your CPUs, your GPUs. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=978.6800000000001s)]
*  And that being said, you said GPUs, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=984.12s)]
*  I'm gonna land this fact on your word there. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=986.96s)]
*  There are no GPUs on the continent. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=991.08s)]
*  None, no. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=992.96s)]
*  So here we are talking about Make Rekonda Real. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=994.24s)]
*  And the African continent has no GPUs. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=997.96s)]
*  So I partnered with this guy by the name of Strive. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1001.72s)]
*  I know Strive, yeah. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1005.2s)]
*  Yeah, so they're gonna be, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1006.04s)]
*  Casava is our partner to launch FYI on the continent. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1009.64s)]
*  And on March 17th, we have an announcement [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1014.52s)]
*  to bring a cluster of GPUs to the continent. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1017.6s)]
*  And we'll announce our partner on March 17th [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1021.92s)]
*  in bringing the first mega cluster of GPUs to the continent. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1025.2s)]
*  It'll be like four nations, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1031.68s)]
*  four or five nations that we're going to. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1033.56s)]
*  Where do you think you'll base them? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1035.52s)]
*  Nigeria, Egypt, Rwanda. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1038.32s)]
*  So basically the entrepreneurial, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1040.44s)]
*  more entrepreneurial nations there. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1042.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1044.0s)]
*  I just did a hour and a half panel [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1045.32s)]
*  with Robert Smith, chairman of Vista. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1048.36s)]
*  Yeah, he was with us at Davos. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1051.08s)]
*  Yeah, and I was with him last week in Miami at the FII summit. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1052.56s)]
*  Well, the second richest black man in the world. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1055.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1057.8s)]
*  Multi-billionaire genius. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  He is brilliant. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1059.96s)]
*  In the States. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1062.4399999999998s)]
*  Second in the States, only first in the States. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1063.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's like other Africans, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1065.08s)]
*  there are Richard and him, in Africa, yes. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1067.3999999999999s)]
*  I know resource economy and land and so forth. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1070.8s)]
*  But anyway, the point is we had a conversation about [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1073.28s)]
*  how do you support the global South [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1076.1999999999998s)]
*  in getting access to this technology, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1079.12s)]
*  to their own large language models, their own GPUs. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1083.12s)]
*  And one of the biggest questions is today's largest LLMs [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1087.04s)]
*  are based upon a Western canon. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1094.04s)]
*  And there's a need for cultural preservation. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1097.08s)]
*  This is beyond just Africa, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1101.6s)]
*  it's for every country in the world. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1103.36s)]
*  How do you preserve the culture of a country [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1105.1599999999999s)]
*  and train up a set of large language models [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  for that country that are based in, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1112.6399999999999s)]
*  how do you go and capture the stories [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1115.24s)]
*  of the grandmothers and grandfathers [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1117.84s)]
*  in a lot of countries which have no written language even? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1120.12s)]
*  Look, I just want to add, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1122.6399999999999s)]
*  first of all, I think that a new civilization [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1127.6399999999999s)]
*  is being born as we speak. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1131.56s)]
*  We were talking about kids. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1135.24s)]
*  I have two little kids, one's three years old, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1139.68s)]
*  just got a diapers, the other one's still in diapers. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1142.72s)]
*  They're not gonna live in the same human civilization [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1148.4s)]
*  I grew up in. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1150.84s)]
*  My daughter's first crush is probably gonna be an AI. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1153.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1156.8s)]
*  Like, get your brain ready. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1158.08s)]
*  My two boys are 13, and my wife and I were worried about [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1161.04s)]
*  what is it gonna be like for them? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1167.8s)]
*  And I'm concerned, pornography when I was growing up [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1169.84s)]
*  was a playboy. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1173.24s)]
*  You had to go buy it at the store when nobody's looking. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1174.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1177.04s)]
*  Now it's in your back pocket all day. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1177.8799999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1179.0s)]
*  So you have that, but if you think about it, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1181.32s)]
*  okay, I've got these two little people, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1183.6399999999999s)]
*  my daughter's first crush may well be an AI. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1187.6s)]
*  When it's time for her to have children, grandkids for me, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1190.68s)]
*  she may open up a laptop or do some kind of holographic [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1194.96s)]
*  interface and with biotech tools, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1197.76s)]
*  she might design my grandkids, okay? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1199.44s)]
*  And then, heaven forbid, when she dies in 90 years, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1202.84s)]
*  100 years. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1207.24s)]
*  Let's go further than that. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1208.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1209.56s)]
*  This is a long journey to show it to you. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1210.3999999999999s)]
*  120 years, 150 years, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1211.72s)]
*  she might be buried on the moon or on Mars. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1213.28s)]
*  Because by then, we'll be a fully face-sparing civilization. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1215.96s)]
*  So that's not the civilization I grew up in. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1219.72s)]
*  Okay, so the question is, this new human civilization [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1222.3200000000002s)]
*  that's coming into being, is it gonna be human? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1225.92s)]
*  Is it gonna be civilized? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1229.0s)]
*  That's the question that all of us have a chance to answer [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1230.8000000000002s)]
*  over the next decade or so. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1233.88s)]
*  And so part of what I think we got wrong in the civilization [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1235.92s)]
*  that we're leaving is we left a lot of people out. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1239.3600000000001s)]
*  Behind, yeah. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1242.68s)]
*  And so there's a lot of overlooked, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1244.0s)]
*  underestimated communities, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1245.84s)]
*  including the folks that Will.I.Am's been working with [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1247.44s)]
*  since 2008, who have genius, who have insight, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1249.84s)]
*  who have creativity, who have ideas, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1254.12s)]
*  who have big problems, which as you always point out, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1256.32s)]
*  means there's big solutions available. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1258.88s)]
*  Biggest problems or the biggest issues. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1260.68s)]
*  Biggest solutions, which is what you are teaching about. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1262.0s)]
*  And so what does that mean? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1263.84s)]
*  What that means is that if you take [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1265.28s)]
*  the most powerful creative tools, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1269.28s)]
*  which is AI and all this sort of stuff, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1271.72s)]
*  and you give it to and connect it to these communities [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1274.7600000000002s)]
*  that are so powerful in their creativity and their need, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1277.1200000000001s)]
*  you could have a human civilization [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1279.8000000000002s)]
*  that is at peace with itself, at peace with the earth. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1281.8400000000001s)]
*  You could solve so many problems, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1286.24s)]
*  but nothing good happens for poor folks [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1288.1200000000001s)]
*  and marginal folks by accident. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1291.72s)]
*  You've gotta have intention. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  You've gotta have strategy. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1294.92s)]
*  I hear a lot of people talking about all the good of AI, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1295.7600000000002s)]
*  but what I like about what Will.I.Am is doing, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1298.1200000000001s)]
*  what we're trying to do, what we're making kind of real, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1299.88s)]
*  you actually have to get in there [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1301.5600000000002s)]
*  and pull people into this conversation. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1303.0s)]
*  And once you do that, what happens? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1304.88s)]
*  The sky's the limit. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1307.8400000000001s)]
*  You think that's right? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1309.2s)]
*  Will, do you see this as a great leveling force of lifting? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1310.3600000000001s)]
*  It's the only reparations we haven't gone get. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1314.0400000000002s)]
*  One of the things that you said is AI is a set of tools [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1318.24s)]
*  to help you on your path. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1321.0800000000002s)]
*  You've been at the forefront of traditional media, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1326.2800000000002s)]
*  traditional creative. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1330.3600000000001s)]
*  Then you've taken it to non-traditional creative, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1331.72s)]
*  and you've been optimistic about AI. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1334.4s)]
*  Most of the other people in the world in traditional media [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1336.04s)]
*  and creative are scared shitless of AI. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1339.28s)]
*  I could see why they're afraid. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1341.4s)]
*  All the unknowns, all the storytelling [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1348.6000000000001s)]
*  that was done really amazing. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1351.68s)]
*  Hollywood did an awesome job scaring the shit out of us. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1357.76s)]
*  Thank you, James Cameron. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1358.96s)]
*  So let's take James Cameron, his perspective of AI, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1361.96s)]
*  where one company is dominant, one product is taking over. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1367.08s)]
*  And then let's take George Lucas'. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1371.84s)]
*  There's lots of AIs, lots of robots. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1375.48s)]
*  That's a democratic one. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1378.3600000000001s)]
*  Can we take Star Trek as well? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1379.88s)]
*  Star Trek as well. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1381.96s)]
*  Lots of AIs. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1383.68s)]
*  I think the future looks more like Star Wars and Star Trek [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1385.16s)]
*  than it does Terminator. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1389.0s)]
*  Because Terminator and The Matrix, that's the same film. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1391.0s)]
*  AI oppression of humans. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1395.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's one company. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1398.3600000000001s)]
*  Messed up the whole entire civilization. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1403.2s)]
*  And everyone's in some pod, living life in The Matrix. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1406.4s)]
*  So Terminator and Matrix, same movie. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1411.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1413.8s)]
*  Prequel, sequel. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1414.64s)]
*  Star Wars, there's lots of robots, lots of companies. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1416.04s)]
*  You could say it's driving. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1421.96s)]
*  Yes, there's an empire. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1423.92s)]
*  But what you have in that movie are Jedis. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1425.68s)]
*  You have this human evolution, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1429.2s)]
*  where it's like everything that was in Star Wars, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1433.8400000000001s)]
*  you could connect that to Aladdin. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1439.8400000000001s)]
*  You could say, hey, what was theory, myth [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1442.0s)]
*  that some genie hops out of some device [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1446.3999999999999s)]
*  to grant your wishes. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1449.8s)]
*  You could say that that was productized [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1452.08s)]
*  and made a product that everyone could use [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1453.9199999999998s)]
*  in the world of Star Wars. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1456.6s)]
*  Where in Aladdin, it was like this coveted, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1458.8s)]
*  there's one, oh my gosh, you have that one. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1461.76s)]
*  Then they scaled it, made it products, it grew, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1464.9599999999998s)]
*  now it's in machines. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1468.4799999999998s)]
*  But if you use that theory, those thesis, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1471.6799999999998s)]
*  those metaphors, those myths, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1473.6399999999999s)]
*  there's something in Star Wars that is in scriptures, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1476.0s)]
*  that is like this hyper spiritual being [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1481.0s)]
*  that there is now practice how to do, how to achieve. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1485.16s)]
*  Joseph Campbell's, you know, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1489.4s)]
*  Hero of a Myth. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1491.24s)]
*  Yeah, the myth, hero, right? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1492.32s)]
*  Hero's Journey. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1493.72s)]
*  Yeah, so the Terminator matrix, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1495.72s)]
*  the human's have given up on their spiritual growth. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1501.08s)]
*  That they just rely on machine so much [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1508.56s)]
*  that the machine is now taken over. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1510.8s)]
*  To the point where, oh shit, I used to remember [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1512.88s)]
*  that reality that we was living, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1514.84s)]
*  let's plug into that simulation. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1516.28s)]
*  That's Terminator matrix. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1518.0s)]
*  The Star Wars, if we're gonna base things on films, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1520.92s)]
*  I go with that one. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1523.84s)]
*  Because that one has this other one that's like, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1525.68s)]
*  how do we make Jedi's real? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1527.96s)]
*  Make Wakanda real is awesome. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1532.76s)]
*  But then after that, we Jedi's bro. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1535.16s)]
*  Fast forward from that technical dependence [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1538.4s)]
*  and making devices and equipment and tools, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1542.28s)]
*  we still will be faced with how do we grow? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1545.72s)]
*  We've seen machines grow. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1548.16s)]
*  We've seen the path, the investment that it takes [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1550.16s)]
*  to refine sand, to create silicone, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1552.96s)]
*  refine some type of mineral, to create lithium battery. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1558.8000000000002s)]
*  Imagine I came up in here and I was like, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1563.44s)]

*  I'm refining it in my mind. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1580.8400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1583.0s)]
*  That's literally what you're doing. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1583.84s)]
*  You're holding refined rare minerals. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1584.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1587.68s)]
*  Throwing advanced algorithms, mathematics on it, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1588.52s)]
*  and electricity, and you can speak to it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1591.64s)]
*  We're gonna get to a point where we're like, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1594.68s)]
*  look what we can do with minerals. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1596.48s)]
*  How do we advance our spiritual capacity [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1598.56s)]
*  and unlock more of our neural network [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1602.16s)]
*  to be able to be that, to where like, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1605.24s)]
*  that's the reason why I'm not worried about AI, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1609.1200000000001s)]
*  because it's gonna unlock that superhuman, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1612.76s)]
*  not superintelligence. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1615.04s)]
*  We've seen it in scriptures. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1616.56s)]
*  We've seen it in myths, the things that, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1617.72s)]
*  the people that we praise and not being blasphemous, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1621.52s)]
*  but in the Bible, it says that you too [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1625.36s)]
*  could create miracles as well. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1628.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1630.08s)]
*  But how do you do that? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1630.92s)]
*  What is the unlock to do that? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1632.12s)]
*  We are going to face that future right around the corner. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1634.04s)]
*  Do you think we're living at a time [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1637.64s)]
*  that is more extraordinary, moving faster [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1639.56s)]
*  than any time in human history? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1643.72s)]
*  Or do you think our equivalent 100 years ago [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1645.56s)]
*  felt that same way when the car and the airplane [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1648.76s)]
*  and all was coming online? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1651.6s)]
*  I think it's different. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1652.8799999999999s)]
*  I think. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1654.48s)]
*  Just checking. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1655.32s)]
*  I think. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1656.1599999999999s)]
*  I had this conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1657.0s)]
*  and he was like, no, every generation feels like [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1659.04s)]
*  they're at the peak of the curve here. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1660.9199999999998s)]
*  I think it's, I think what we're feeling, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1663.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1666.0s)]
*  It's literally like a hundred years. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1668.48s)]
*  So every like 1920 to 2025, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1671.52s)]
*  like what was popping off in 1925 with the World's Fair [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1676.04s)]
*  and all futurism, the concept of future [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1680.52s)]
*  happened in the early 1900s. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1684.0s)]
*  The concept of future was not 1825. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1686.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1689.2s)]
*  This concept of tomorrow. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1690.36s)]
*  Tomorrowland, yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1691.92s)]
*  Is 1925. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1693.08s)]
*  And World's Fairs and technology [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1695.8s)]
*  and that industrial revolution. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1698.8s)]
*  And to that person, they thought, oh my gosh, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1701.48s)]
*  this is it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1707.32s)]
*  This is the pinnacle of humanity. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1708.1599999999999s)]
*  Look at what we're doing. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1710.0s)]
*  We could have our way with stone and craft. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1711.48s)]
*  We have our way with alchemy of the things that were, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1717.32s)]
*  look what we can do. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1720.9199999999998s)]
*  We could refine aluminum and mend it and fly in it. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1722.36s)]
*  We could transport things on steam engines and trains. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1729.48s)]
*  We could defy gravity at the highest order. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1734.6s)]
*  I can speak my words in one device [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1738.6s)]
*  and it comes out the other side. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1739.96s)]
*  Think about what the world was like in 1925. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1741.48s)]
*  Imagine Tesla, not Elon's Tesla, Nikola Tesla. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1745.16s)]

*  Like wireless electricity, y'all. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1754.52s)]

*  electromagnetic spectrum and the concept of like RGB [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1777.6399999999999s)]
*  and the other side of blue, which is violet [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1782.0800000000002s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1857.92s)]
*  I wish instead of, yeah, speaking of Radio Shack, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1859.4s)]
*  you're just throwing up things that I'm just slam dunking. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1862.76s)]
*  Radio Shack, if I was 18 years old, 15 years old, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1866.1599999999999s)]
*  going to the guitar center versus going to Radio Shack, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1871.32s)]
*  I wish I was hanging out and dreaming about [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1875.1999999999998s)]
*  going to Radio Shack because I would have, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1877.12s)]
*  being able to take those bits and pieces of equipment [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1880.56s)]
*  and circuit boards because that's not at the ready right now. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1883.04s)]
*  Components is, there's no store for components right now. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1887.3999999999999s)]
*  It drives me nuts. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1892.4399999999998s)]
*  Like if you want to make some shit right now, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1893.6s)]
*  it ain't like, yo, let's go to the component shop. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1896.76s)]
*  There's no like, yeah, Home Depot got wood, nails, screws. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1898.96s)]
*  As far as like consumer electronics and chips. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1902.92s)]
*  It was Fry's for a while. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1906.96s)]
*  Fry's was that, that's donezo. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1908.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's gone. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1910.1200000000001s)]
*  Like component shop, fuck out of here. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1910.96s)]
*  The other stuff I hate is that there's no place [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1913.04s)]
*  I can go to buy pure chemicals for my kids [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1914.76s)]
*  to play with chemistry. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1918.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1920.04s)]
*  When I was my kid's age, I had access to potassium, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1920.88s)]
*  nitrate, potassium, chlorate, magnesium, sulfur. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1924.32s)]
*  I used to build stuff and blow shit up all the time. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1927.56s)]
*  And it was fun, I learned. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1930.08s)]
*  Now I'd be put in jail. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1931.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1932.48s)]
*  Take me back to make Wakanda real. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1936.52s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, everybody having access to components [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1938.6399999999999s)]
*  at the ready to, you know what I mean? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1943.24s)]
*  Because the folks that are leading [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1945.76s)]
*  have access to components. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1948.84s)]
*  The folks that are leading. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1951.24s)]
*  Components now are digital and virtual. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1952.56s)]
*  And I'm creating virtualized circuit boards [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1956.24s)]
*  and virtualized robots. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1959.04s)]
*  But they know they can do it. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1960.9199999999998s)]
*  Our community, that's not first to mind. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1963.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1967.6799999999998s)]
*  That's part of what I think. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1968.52s)]
*  I mean, it's so much stuff that Will said, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1970.52s)]
*  I just wanna go back and underscore. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1972.36s)]
*  We're in danger of creating a human civilization [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1976.1599999999999s)]
*  that has an awful lot of data and very little wisdom. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1978.8s)]
*  And what you hear, this idea of the soul, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1982.8s)]
*  this idea of the human heart, of the human being developed. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1987.84s)]
*  And I've heard Will, I am talking about [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1992.32s)]
*  all the billions of dollars that we spend [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1995.48s)]
*  to develop the technology, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1997.12s)]
*  but then you wanna try to develop a kid, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=1998.6799999999998s)]
*  nobody's got a penny. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2000.84s)]
*  And that is amazing. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2002.36s)]
*  I mean, an unlimited checkbook. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2005.12s)]
*  Yeah, for developing the technology. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2007.24s)]
*  And yet, look what he's trying to do with young people. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2009.24s)]
*  And so I do think that [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2012.24s)]
*  when he talks about the Jedi, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2016.68s)]
*  when he talks about the Wakandans, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2018.24s)]
*  they have a very spiritual base. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2021.48s)]
*  They have to go into the ancestral realm. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2023.52s)]
*  They do all kinds of stuff. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2025.52s)]
*  And that's a part of what makes them [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2026.88s)]
*  a heroic nation in fiction. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2028.4s)]
*  Think about how important fiction is. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2031.52s)]
*  Whenever you go into a civilizational crisis, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2036.0s)]
*  a civilizational transition, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2038.92s)]
*  the people who you normally turn to, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2042.52s)]
*  the politicians to solve problems, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2045.8400000000001s)]
*  the business leaders to solve problems, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2048.96s)]
*  the generals to solve problems, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2051.2000000000003s)]
*  suddenly they become more and more anemic. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2053.08s)]
*  Your politicians can't pass a bill. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2055.84s)]
*  The whole system goes crazy. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2057.52s)]
*  The business leaders right now, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2060.2000000000003s)]
*  they're more interested in giving robots jobs and people. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2061.84s)]
*  And the generals, how are they gonna protect you [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2065.28s)]
*  from a pandemic or school shootings? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2067.08s)]
*  So suddenly a different set of people [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2069.08s)]
*  in periods like this become very important. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2071.68s)]
*  Your artists, your mystics, your entrepreneurs, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2073.96s)]
*  the people who are usually at the margin of society [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2078.7999999999997s)]
*  become very central to this transition [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2082.56s)]
*  because suddenly, to his point, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2084.3199999999997s)]
*  tomorrow is up for grabs. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2087.4s)]
*  So the people who can see, the visionaries, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2089.7599999999998s)]
*  the people who not only have a brain, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2092.44s)]
*  but also a heart and a soul and a connection [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2095.48s)]
*  to something more profound, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2098.6s)]
*  suddenly they become very important. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2100.7599999999998s)]
*  However, nobody told them [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2101.7999999999997s)]
*  that they were gonna be that important. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2103.56s)]
*  So when you have communities [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2105.12s)]
*  where you have a bumper crop of entrepreneurs [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2107.3199999999997s)]
*  and creatives and mystics, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2110.24s)]
*  and one of those communities [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2111.48s)]
*  happens to be a black community in the United States, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2112.8799999999997s)]
*  you got a lot of spiritual people, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2115.08s)]
*  soulful people, creative people, whatever. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2116.48s)]
*  Nobody told them though, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2118.3199999999997s)]
*  you get a chance to be a part of creating [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2120.16s)]
*  a new human civilization [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2122.16s)]
*  that can respond only to your problems, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2124.2799999999997s)]
*  which are the problems of the next seven generations [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2126.56s)]
*  of people who don't even look like you, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2128.9599999999996s)]
*  that is your great calling. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2131.48s)]
*  Now, when you can go to a community that's suffering [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2132.3199999999997s)]
*  and give them a great calling [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2134.12s)]
*  and give them great tools. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2136.04s)]
*  People need a compelling future. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2137.16s)]
*  A compelling future. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2138.4s)]
*  And let me just say one more thing about the future. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2139.24s)]
*  I believe that we're experiencing, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2141.68s)]
*  I'm not saying it, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2145.8399999999997s)]
*  I believe we're experiencing a different form of future. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2146.68s)]
*  Of who? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2150.3199999999997s)]
*  A different form of future. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2151.16s)]
*  Let me just make, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2153.68s)]
*  in indigenous agrarian societies, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2155.68s)]
*  the time is a circle. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2158.52s)]
*  It's just a cycle of seasons. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2161.08s)]
*  The sun goes up, the sun goes down, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2162.7599999999998s)]
*  the seasons come around, the moon goes around. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  Born and die. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2165.88s)]
*  And so guess what? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2166.72s)]
*  So to his point, tomorrow and yesterday [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2168.24s)]
*  are the same damn thing. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2170.0s)]
*  Cause you're literally just living out. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2171.16s)]
*  So what's the most important thing [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2173.48s)]
*  in indigenous society, agrarian society? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2175.16s)]
*  It's preservation. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2177.44s)]
*  Preservation of seed, preservation of ritual, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2178.92s)]
*  preservation of culture. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2181.52s)]
*  That's how you survive. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2182.36s)]
*  But tomorrow isn't really a thing. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2183.44s)]
*  The industrial society comes along [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2185.7999999999997s)]
*  and suddenly time is linear. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2188.0s)]
*  For the first time, the past is behind you, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2190.44s)]
*  the present is with you, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2194.04s)]
*  and the future is over there someplace. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2195.2400000000002s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2197.0s)]
*  I've not heard this. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2197.84s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2198.6800000000003s)]
*  But now what's the most important thing? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2199.52s)]
*  No longer is it preservation. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2203.04s)]
*  The most important capacity for survival [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2204.4s)]
*  is the ability to plan. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2206.4s)]
*  And to imagine and invent. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2208.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes, and to have a plan against that. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2210.2000000000003s)]
*  Because listen, if you think about time now, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2212.1600000000003s)]
*  you're on a train track, you're on the train. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2215.04s)]
*  You gotta plan to make sure you get to the future [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2217.52s)]
*  that you want. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2219.92s)]
*  And so all of the past 100 years, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2220.76s)]
*  you put kids in school and you tell them, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2222.32s)]
*  your fifth grade, what's your plan for your life? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2224.28s)]
*  What are you gonna do? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2226.88s)]
*  What are you gonna become? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2228.1600000000003s)]
*  Because if you don't have a plan, you're done. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2229.44s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2232.6400000000003s)]
*  What was your plan for 2020? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2233.92s)]
*  Suddenly you're in a different world where the future, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2237.48s)]
*  yes, it's linear, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2240.76s)]
*  but rather than you being on a train going to the future, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2242.1600000000003s)]
*  you experience the future now as an onrushing future. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2245.6800000000003s)]
*  You're on the train track and the future's coming to you. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2250.28s)]
*  Fast, multiple futures. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2253.2000000000003s)]
*  Whether you like it or not. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2254.84s)]
*  Whether you like it. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2255.6800000000003s)]
*  There's no on off switch, no velocity knob. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2256.52s)]
*  Exactly, and so what's happening is people are experiencing [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2258.2400000000002s)]
*  multiple onrushing futures and they don't know what to do. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2260.7200000000003s)]
*  Preservation is not the key. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2264.76s)]
*  Planning is impossible. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2266.7200000000003s)]
*  It's the preparation to pivot. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2268.1200000000003s)]
*  The preparation to pivot, to be able to recognize change [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2270.28s)]
*  and then to respond to change, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2275.4s)]
*  that's incredibly important. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2277.48s)]
*  But if you are a young kid in urban America [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2278.8s)]
*  and you're very good at pivoting, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2282.64s)]
*  guess what you're called? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2284.32s)]
*  ADHD and a thousand other things. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2285.32s)]
*  They're gonna give you a bunch of pills [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2288.16s)]
*  or throw you out of school or put you in jail. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2289.2000000000003s)]
*  And so the people who have the capacity for creativity, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2291.08s)]
*  for vision and to also to pivot, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2293.96s)]
*  people have, you gotta be able to move with it. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2295.88s)]
*  The people who have those capacities [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2298.92s)]
*  are disproportionately marginal. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2301.2000000000003s)]
*  They're low income, they're often black and brown. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2303.2400000000002s)]
*  They are key to us having a society that works. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2305.44s)]
*  So it's not charity. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2308.16s)]
*  There's also one point out, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2309.28s)]
*  when we say we wanna make Rekonda real, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2310.4s)]
*  that's not, oh, we're asking for some charitable allocation [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2313.32s)]
*  of laptops to like poor schools. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2318.04s)]
*  No, no, it's much more profound than that. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2319.96s)]
*  We're saying, let's take people who have these capacities [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2321.7400000000002s)]
*  that he's demonstrated, well, I am, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2325.12s)]
*  a million times with robotics or whatever [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2327.16s)]
*  and combine them with these new tools [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2329.44s)]
*  so that the people who can rock with and roll with [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2333.18s)]
*  can help the whole society rock with it and roll with it. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2335.2s)]
*  I wanna slightly shift here in the following way. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2337.3599999999997s)]
*  One of my hopes and beliefs is that AI [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2340.48s)]
*  will enable a meritocracy where it can lift everybody [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2343.2799999999997s)]
*  to their highest level of potential. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2347.68s)]
*  And it also levels the playing field [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2349.9199999999996s)]
*  and gives people an ability to dream [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2352.04s)]
*  more than they've ever dreamed before. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2355.2s)]
*  That's on one side of the equation. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2357.64s)]
*  The other side of the equation, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2359.3199999999997s)]
*  I just had this, I just did a Moonshots podcast [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2360.3999999999996s)]
*  with Ray Dalio and we're talking about [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2362.64s)]
*  where the future is going and the notion [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2365.2s)]
*  that when the Fed drops rates, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2368.36s)]
*  now instead of hiring more people, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2371.48s)]
*  I'm investing in AI agents and robots. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2374.1s)]
*  And so jobs start vanishing. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2376.8399999999997s)]
*  And for me, one of the biggest dangers of the future [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2380.12s)]
*  is a fracturing of society where, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2384.24s)]
*  there's the haves and the have nots, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2391.12s)]
*  but now we've got people who are not getting the jobs [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2393.5s)]
*  because they're going to technology and automation. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2396.86s)]
*  And maybe they're getting UBI, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2401.1s)]
*  but that's not fulfilling. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2403.74s)]
*  That's not a purpose driven life. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2405.3s)]
*  So help me here, what are you seeing? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2407.5s)]
*  So a job was somebody like, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2411.46s)]
*  I was just walking from this point to that point. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2414.3s)]
*  Somebody came up to me and was like, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2416.82s)]
*  you know, William, what do you think of DEI? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2419.18s)]
*  I'm like, oh, so heavy, everyone. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2422.3399999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2426.66s)]
*  DEI is not just black and brown [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2431.2599999999998s)]
*  and folks that are like, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2434.2799999999997s)]
*  have disabilities to be in the workplace. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2437.5s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2440.62s)]
*  And DEI is important for innovation [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2443.2599999999998s)]
*  because when you have black and brown [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2447.48s)]
*  folks that are disabled working in equal, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2449.2999999999997s)]
*  creatively, creative banter, marketing strategy, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2453.8199999999997s)]
*  biz dev, you innovate. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2457.7s)]
*  If you just have one type of person. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2460.7s)]
*  If you have monoculture, it doesn't innovate. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2462.62s)]
*  But now let's fast forward to 2045. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2466.8599999999997s)]
*  Why DEI now? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2470.62s)]
*  Because you want humans in the loop. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2472.62s)]
*  Another diversity is, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2475.42s)]
*  no, we don't want just machines and robots. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2476.72s)]
*  We want humans in the loop. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2478.54s)]
*  So when big companies are like, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2479.38s)]
*  yeah, we're gonna drop our DEI program. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2483.54s)]
*  What are they telling you? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2485.7400000000002s)]
*  These companies that are doing that [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2487.46s)]
*  are also the ones that are gonna heavy arm AI employees. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2489.26s)]
*  That means if you're driving a Tesla [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2495.3s)]
*  and a Tesla is like a level three autonomous vehicle, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2496.7400000000002s)]
*  and then Waymo's are like level five, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2502.34s)]
*  you don't need a human in it. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2504.58s)]
*  This means by 2035, there are level five companies. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2506.44s)]
*  No human in it. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2511.32s)]
*  No, I mean, I have an AI venture fund [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2512.36s)]
*  and these are the conversations. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2515.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like, we're gonna back the human and the AI [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2516.8s)]
*  and the human's just gonna be told, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2520.84s)]
*  keep your hands off the controls. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2522.76s)]
*  So it's like level five companies. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2524.48s)]
*  There's new terminologies. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2526.88s)]
*  By 2028, you're gonna hear terminology like agents, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2530.2000000000003s)]
*  the agentic society. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2535.72s)]
*  That's new, that's 2025 terms. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2537.04s)]
*  It's terms, that's today, yes. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2538.7999999999997s)]
*  That wasn't 2022 term agentic. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2540.2s)]
*  No. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2542.68s)]
*  It's now. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2543.6s)]
*  Level five companies is 2026, 2027. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2544.7599999999998s)]
*  Start hearing it, you hear it here first. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2549.3199999999997s)]
*  Level five companies. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2550.9199999999996s)]
*  And all the companies that are like, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2552.68s)]
*  hey, this company just stopped their DEI program, why? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2555.3199999999997s)]
*  Here's now, it's not black, brown [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2559.3599999999997s)]
*  and folks with disabilities. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2561.12s)]
*  It's because these companies [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2562.7999999999997s)]
*  are gonna be the first companies to adopt [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2563.96s)]
*  fully autonomous positions [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2567.8s)]
*  or augmenting positions to eventually [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2570.44s)]
*  just have a full department of AI. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2574.16s)]
*  But the question becomes now, if I say, listen, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2576.56s)]
*  I am a humanistic CEO or board of directors [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2579.08s)]
*  and I only hire humans for this work, I'm out of business. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2583.2s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2588.0s)]
*  So because you're starting to see the play [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2589.16s)]
*  being executed now, we are at play. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2593.6s)]
*  These moves- [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2598.2s)]
*  We humans are. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2599.04s)]
*  Society is at play. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2599.86s)]
*  You're seeing these moves take shape now. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2601.2s)]
*  Doesn't have to be that way. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2605.24s)]
*  Doesn't have to be that way like, yo, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2608.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm a humanistic company, I only hire humans [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2610.48s)]
*  and damn it, I lost. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2614.36s)]
*  Why'd you lose? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2617.4s)]
*  Well, because the one employee [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2618.2799999999997s)]
*  that got a thousand bots beat me. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2620.04s)]
*  Doesn't have to be that way. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2622.88s)]
*  For example, yo bro, I got a motorcycle. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2624.56s)]
*  He's like, yo, I just bought a fighter pilot. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2629.56s)]
*  He can't buy a fighter pilot to get to San Diego faster. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2631.76s)]
*  It's not legal for him to do that. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2636.44s)]
*  He can't go out and buy a stealth. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2639.44s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2642.0s)]
*  Yes, they exist. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2643.52s)]
*  We know that, we know a stealth exists. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2645.0s)]
*  I don't care how much money Elon got. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2646.6000000000004s)]
*  He's not gonna be like, yo, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2649.4s)]
*  fuck these fucking Teslas, fuck a helicopter, bro. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2651.2s)]
*  I need that stealth. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2654.8399999999997s)]
*  Let me get that stealth. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2656.52s)]
*  He's not doing that. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2658.7999999999997s)]
*  I did that on purpose. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2659.64s)]
*  Actually, I jazzed it. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2661.04s)]
*  I made a mistake and repeated it [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2661.8799999999997s)]
*  because that's what you do with jazz. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2663.48s)]
*  Anyways, Elon's not doing that. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2665.3599999999997s)]
*  They're like, yo, Elon, you got a stealth, bro? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2668.0s)]
*  He'd be like, no, I don't have a stealth. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2669.44s)]
*  How can I get a stealth? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2672.6s)]
*  Wait, you're the richest dude in the world, bro. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2673.56s)]
*  You can't just go buy a fucking stealth [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2675.3199999999997s)]
*  to get to New York in like an hour? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2677.96s)]
*  No, there's certain level of things [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2680.0s)]
*  that just not fucking possible. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2683.16s)]
*  So why is it okay that there's gonna be level five companies [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2684.8s)]
*  putting humanistic, why is that even? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2689.2s)]
*  Wait, who's making up these rules? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2692.44s)]
*  Why is that gonna be the case? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2694.36s)]
*  We know that. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2697.2s)]
*  We know that in 2025 right now, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2698.04s)]
*  if I wanted to go get a job, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2700.4s)]
*  I can't get a job without a bank account. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2701.84s)]
*  I can't get a job without an email account. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2704.0s)]
*  I can't get a job without a phone. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2706.32s)]
*  I can't get a job without a laptop. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2708.04s)]
*  There's certain things that I need. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2710.92s)]
*  And so that being said, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2712.16s)]
*  I'm paused before I go into number six, which is coming. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2714.96s)]
*  Now imagine you have some money. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2717.76s)]
*  You got $20 million. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2719.56s)]
*  You wanna buy a house. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2720.92s)]
*  You can't go buy a house with $25 million cash. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2722.88s)]
*  You need a bank account. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2726.8s)]
*  Now say, for example, you get that house, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2728.44s)]
*  paying that $25 million on a nice house. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2730.6s)]
*  The person that sold that house, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2733.68s)]
*  he'd be like, yo, excuse me, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2734.8s)]
*  where the fuck's the toilet, bro? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2736.96s)]
*  And he's like, oh, yes, the toilet. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2738.72s)]
*  This is a new house. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2741.4399999999996s)]
*  Everybody is going to share the same communal toilets. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2742.3999999999996s)]
*  Wait, wait, what the fuck, what? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2746.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes, you know, we share the same communal toilets. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2748.56s)]
*  And where's the kitchen? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2751.2s)]
*  Same thing, same communal kitchen. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2752.2s)]
*  Why the fuck would you buy a house [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2755.2799999999997s)]
*  sharing the same communal toilet and kitchen? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2756.8799999999997s)]
*  So why is it that we're walking into a future [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2759.6s)]
*  and we're gonna share the same AI? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2761.6s)]
*  Fuck out of your bro-dating tomorrow. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2763.56s)]
*  If companies have AIs, people need to have their own AI, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2766.2400000000002s)]
*  not access to AI. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2770.12s)]
*  Like we have access to Spotify. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2771.56s)]
*  Like we have access to an Uber. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2773.48s)]
*  Like we have access to everything else. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2775.4s)]
*  Certain shit is fucking personal. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2777.44s)]
*  Like my digestive system is mine. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2779.36s)]
*  My immune system is mine. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2781.28s)]
*  My nervous system, my skeletorio system, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2782.84s)]
*  my systems are mine. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2784.6s)]
*  So my data system needs to be mine. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2786.32s)]
*  My AI system needs to be mine. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2788.36s)]
*  Data is gold, so is my blood and my plasma. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2789.84s)]
*  That's my shit. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2792.52s)]
*  And so the AI and the data that's gonna be reflection [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2794.04s)]
*  in me should be mine. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2797.0s)]
*  And I use that as a metaphor to the communal. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2798.92s)]
*  Your shit, you're not gonna buy a house [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2803.2799999999997s)]
*  where you're sharing bathrooms. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2804.96s)]
*  Why are we sharing AI? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2806.32s)]
*  Now, to the sixth thing. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2807.64s)]
*  When you have your own AI [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2813.04s)]
*  in the society that we're living in, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2815.72s)]
*  and your data's yours, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2817.08s)]
*  and there's a fridge, some server in your house. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2818.52s)]
*  Like in the house, there's a refrigerator [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2821.0s)]
*  that stores all the stuff you're gonna eat. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2822.72s)]
*  For some reason, we shipped all of our data [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2825.6s)]
*  to somebody else's cloud that shared all the stuff [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2827.56s)]
*  that we consumed. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2829.7999999999997s)]
*  That's gonna be in the home. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2832.48s)]
*  Do you operate your own servers? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2833.64s)]
*  No, I'm about to do that. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2835.6s)]
*  Okay, just checking if you're way ahead of everybody else. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2837.04s)]
*  Oh no, I got some GPUs. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2840.04s)]
*  I got GPUs and servers at the building. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2841.8799999999997s)]
*  But as far as like- [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2846.6s)]
*  But the notion that every individual [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2847.8399999999997s)]
*  owns their own identity AI, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2849.68s)]
*  their own personal AI. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2852.2799999999997s)]
*  Wait, that word? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2854.08s)]
*  Identity AI. Identity AI. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2855.8799999999997s)]
*  As opposed to agentic. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2857.6s)]
*  That's a good word. Identic. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2859.08s)]
*  You heard it here, you said that. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2860.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, I know, I've heard that before as well. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2861.8399999999997s)]
*  I heard that shit. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2864.52s)]
*  Okay, so- That shit's awesome, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2865.3599999999997s)]
*  right, that shit? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2866.52s)]
*  Yeah, but I, but good. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2867.3599999999997s)]
*  So, but you know what the beautiful thing [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2868.68s)]
*  about having an identity AI is I can replicate myself, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2871.16s)]
*  and I can replicate a thousand of me, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2873.8799999999997s)]
*  and I can send them out to every conference on the planet [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2876.3599999999997s)]
*  and go out there and so like meet [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2878.88s)]
*  with as many cool people as you can. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2881.36s)]
*  You know what my interests are, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2883.2400000000002s)]
*  you know who I am in my heart, my soul, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2884.4s)]
*  and what my business interests are, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2886.04s)]
*  and represent me and come back with, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2888.1200000000003s)]
*  go forth out there and bring back goodness. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2890.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2894.6800000000003s)]
*  So, I mean, one of the things that is concerning [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2895.92s)]
*  is the speed at which this stuff is accelerating [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2898.28s)]
*  is mind blowing, and we're still operating [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2901.36s)]
*  with the same 100 billion neurons, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2904.0s)]
*  100 trillion synoptic connections that we operated with [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2905.44s)]
*  on the savannas of Africa 100,000 years ago. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2909.24s)]
*  And that's a challenge. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2911.68s)]
*  So, one of the areas is our, you know, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2913.4s)]
*  when BCI comes online, brain computer interface, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2916.52s)]
*  are you gonna plug your neocortex into the cloud? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2920.04s)]
*  No. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2922.32s)]
*  No? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2923.16s)]
*  Mm-mm, I'll tell you why. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2924.0s)]
*  I wanna know why, because I'm sorely tempted, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2925.32s)]
*  I mean, into your cloud. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2928.12s)]
*  No, until you have an AI that's yours, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2931.12s)]
*  and there's a product that allows you to own [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2935.36s)]
*  what you experience as you experience it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2940.36s)]
*  That's not the configuration right now. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2946.76s)]
*  And so, as AI, we still have to answer the question [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2950.2000000000003s)]
*  on energy efficiency. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2956.1200000000003s)]
*  20 watts running our neocortex. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2959.0s)]
*  20 watts of power are our neural network. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2961.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2964.52s)]
*  Well, I think it's like a couple of hundred million, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2965.3599999999997s)]
*  trillion watts to power. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2968.64s)]
*  It's a lot, let's put it that way. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2971.2s)]
*  So, we haven't talked about utilizing, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2973.8799999999997s)]
*  farming the human brain for power efficiency. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2986.24s)]
*  I don't like where that points to. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2990.28s)]
*  I don't like- [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2992.28s)]
*  Towards the matrix more than anything else. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2993.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2995.1200000000003s)]
*  So, that, that, that, that, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=2995.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little spooky. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3000.56s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3002.08s)]
*  I mean, I do- [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3002.92s)]
*  I would stay away from anything that points to [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3004.1200000000003s)]
*  harnessing the human brain and farming out human minds [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3006.8s)]
*  to power AI, because we can't figure out how to do that. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3011.4s)]
*  I don't see it that way, my friend. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3015.96s)]
*  No, I'm just saying that's where my mind goes. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3017.32s)]
*  So, you and I, you know, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3019.36s)]
*  Ray Kurzweil has been a mentor for me, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3020.2400000000002s)]
*  my co-founder of Singularity University, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3022.1200000000003s)]
*  and we started a few companies together, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3024.0s)]
*  and you know Ray from many different aspects, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3025.6000000000004s)]
*  including his music. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3028.28s)]
*  I just, I saw him at the Time 100 in San Francisco. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3029.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3033.52s)]
*  I ran over to him. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3034.36s)]
*  I'm like, you're the reason why I'm into AI, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3035.7200000000003s)]
*  because one of the machines I learned how to make music on [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3040.7200000000003s)]
*  was a Kurzweil. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3044.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3045.48s)]
*  And so when I'm just like Lin, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3046.32s)]
*  Roger Lin made the Lin 900, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3049.0800000000004s)]
*  and then the MPC 60, MPC 3000, MPC 2000. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3051.04s)]
*  I researched the people that make the machines [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3057.28s)]
*  that helped me- [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3059.48s)]
*  Be who you are. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3060.76s)]
*  Be who I am. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3061.6000000000004s)]
*  So when I found out that Roger Lin was a person, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3062.56s)]
*  and then, you know, Ray Kurzweil was the Kurzweil, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3066.1200000000003s)]
*  and then I started seeing like documentaries on the dude, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3070.2000000000003s)]
*  where he's like, you know, music compute, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3073.72s)]
*  and he was that freaking- [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3076.7999999999997s)]
*  The Transcendental Man. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3079.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3080.4399999999996s)]
*  Then he was at MIT and the Media Lab. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3081.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3083.56s)]
*  Then I went to Boston, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3084.52s)]
*  met Professor Patrick Winston back in 2005. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3086.24s)]
*  Like it's Ray Kurzweil. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3088.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a person that got me interested in AI, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3090.16s)]
*  is that guy. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3093.16s)]
*  So Ray talks about BCI, Brain-Computer Interface, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3094.0s)]
*  at high bandwidth by the early 2030s, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3097.9199999999996s)]
*  2033 or thereabouts, right? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3101.2s)]
*  So when I'm doing something complicated on my phone, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3102.84s)]
*  like when you're using FYI on your phone, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3106.92s)]
*  I'm guessing most of the computation [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3109.88s)]
*  doesn't take place on the phone. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3111.48s)]
*  The data gets collected, it goes to the edge of the cloud, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3113.04s)]
*  it gets computed there and the answer comes back. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3116.1600000000003s)]
*  And in the same fashion, the notion would be, you know, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3118.88s)]
*  if we're connecting our brain to the cloud, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3121.8s)]
*  and I want to understand quantum physics [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3123.88s)]
*  or how to solve a quantum equation, I can't do that, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3126.2000000000003s)]
*  but I can send the data to the cloud, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3129.4s)]
*  and the answer can come back to me. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3131.36s)]
*  You don't want that kind of extra, you know, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3133.56s)]
*  on-demand horsepower? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3136.04s)]
*  No. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3137.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3139.04s)]
*  In a world? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3140.4s)]
*  In a world where everything was equal and trustworthy. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3142.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3146.7200000000003s)]
*  But in this world, fuck no. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3147.6400000000003s)]
*  On principle, I just can't trust greed. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3151.08s)]
*  That is wisdom. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3155.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3157.1200000000003s)]
*  Let me just say a few things. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3159.2000000000003s)]
*  Please. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3160.76s)]
*  I haven't considered the way that you guys have [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3162.2000000000003s)]
*  that particular technology, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3165.4s)]
*  and so I don't have an informed view about it. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3167.1600000000003s)]
*  I do think that the level of trust [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3169.92s)]
*  that everyday people have in technology [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3174.32s)]
*  is going down in some ways. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3177.96s)]
*  People are actually using it more, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3180.36s)]
*  so they're enacting trust, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3181.48s)]
*  but their actual conscious experience is low trust. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3184.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you why. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3188.44s)]
*  Silicon Valley, as just kind of a metaphor [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3191.0s)]
*  for the technology community, of course, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3194.1600000000003s)]
*  it's in Austin and Boston and wherever, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3195.5600000000004s)]
*  but Silicon Valley is a metaphor, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3197.0800000000004s)]
*  is eating stuff. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3200.5600000000004s)]
*  The three power centers, not Silicon Valley, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3203.32s)]
*  have been Wall Street, Hollywood, and Washington, D.C. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3205.5600000000004s)]
*  Silicon Valley is eating Hollywood [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3208.84s)]
*  with streaming and everything else. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3211.48s)]
*  Yep. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3213.5600000000004s)]
*  But that's happened before with Hollywood 8 theater. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3215.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3219.2000000000003s)]
*  And operas and Broadway and Weston. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3220.2s)]
*  We've seen that kind of eating back before. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3224.48s)]
*  I think the challenge is that Silicon Valley [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3227.16s)]
*  is eating Hollywood and entertainment [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3229.68s)]
*  and attention is now a commodity, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3233.2s)]
*  and you look now at the social media impact. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3237.64s)]
*  So there's a challenge there. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3240.6s)]
*  It's eating Wall Street when you think about [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3242.68s)]
*  decentralized finance, crypto, et cetera, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3245.9199999999996s)]
*  and now it's eating Washington, D.C. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3248.4s)]
*  And you can't have this conversation [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3250.44s)]
*  without appreciating what Elon Musk has done, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3252.28s)]
*  which when I worked at the White House, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3256.48s)]
*  I had to go through a whole bunch of clearances, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3258.88s)]
*  the FBI, like Elon Musk has- [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3261.52s)]
*  You didn't take a chainsaw to it? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3263.7200000000003s)]
*  No, listen, no. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3265.04s)]
*  But when you think about what's going on, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3270.1200000000003s)]
*  Curtis Yarvin, who is the philosopher [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3272.84s)]
*  of the dark enlightenment, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3276.28s)]
*  he is a very scary guy in terms of what he is proposing [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3278.44s)]
*  that America, that democracy has failed. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3282.2400000000002s)]
*  Curtis Yarvin has the ear of Elon, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3284.96s)]
*  he has the ear of Peter Thiel, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3286.88s)]
*  he has the ear of a lot of powerful people in Silicon Valley, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3288.92s)]
*  and his view is what he calls the dark enlightenment, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3291.8s)]
*  that the liberal democracy has failed, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3295.0400000000004s)]
*  we now need a CEO monarch, basically a dictator, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3298.1200000000003s)]
*  for the United States, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3302.0800000000004s)]
*  and when Elon goes in the front door [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3303.2000000000003s)]
*  and brings a bunch of kids with laptops, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3305.68s)]
*  that's the equivalent on the old days of showing up [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3308.04s)]
*  to the palace with soldiers and guns, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3310.52s)]
*  because what's key is grabbing all of the data, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3314.64s)]
*  and so there's something that's happening, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3317.56s)]
*  which we just can't ignore, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3318.7599999999998s)]
*  which is that Silicon Valley for a while [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3320.8799999999997s)]
*  seemed to be a force for good. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3324.48s)]
*  It was these outsiders, these kids who could code, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3327.04s)]
*  these nerds who everybody had counted out. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3330.8399999999997s)]
*  When you had Occupy Wall Street in 2013, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3334.32s)]
*  nobody was, it was Occupy Wall, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3338.2400000000002s)]
*  it wasn't Occupy Silicon Valley, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3339.76s)]
*  people thought the people in Silicon Valley [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3341.04s)]
*  were making money the honest way, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3342.2000000000003s)]
*  building products everybody liked, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3343.2000000000003s)]
*  and they were going up against the odds. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3344.36s)]
*  Now there's something that's changed, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3345.96s)]
*  and this past election I think [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3347.92s)]
*  saw a different face of Silicon Valley, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3351.2400000000002s)]
*  where you saw a turning away from the idea of inclusion, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3354.6800000000003s)]
*  a turning away from the idea of ESG, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3360.3999999999996s)]
*  and a turning away from the idea of democracy, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3364.9199999999996s)]
*  so that now you do have explicit, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3366.48s)]
*  this is not, I'm not making stuff up, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3369.08s)]
*  explicit anti-democratic, authoritarian ideas [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3370.9199999999996s)]
*  that have begun to influence the way [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3375.44s)]
*  that Silicon Valley billionaires are playing. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3377.0s)]
*  And so when you want to talk about technology, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3379.12s)]
*  you also have to talk about the technologists, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3383.68s)]
*  and the technologists have jumped the fence [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3385.64s)]
*  to my point of view from, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3388.4s)]
*  in too many, in too, in large numbers, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3390.84s)]
*  from people who I believed in, trusted, was excited by, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3392.84s)]
*  no bigger fan than me of any of these technology guys. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3397.88s)]
*  I saw it as like the revenge of the nerds. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3401.56s)]
*  As a nerd, I was like, this is great, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3403.12s)]
*  that these, you know, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3405.2000000000003s)]
*  like the jocks are finally getting surpassed [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3406.04s)]
*  by like the nerds, I loved it. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3407.92s)]
*  And now I love it a lot less. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3409.6800000000003s)]
*  And so I think that, again, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3411.32s)]
*  we need technologists who have a different heart. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3413.84s)]
*  We need technologists who have a different view. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3417.08s)]
*  We need technologists who believe in people, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3419.48s)]
*  who believe in the soul, who believe in inclusion. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3421.2s)]
*  And those kinds of technologists and technology companies [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3424.8s)]
*  need to get a lot more support. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3427.44s)]
*  You're an investor, might be investors listening. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3429.12s)]
*  I think that the question is, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3431.16s)]
*  is technology gonna be used to lift people up, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3433.24s)]
*  or to put people down? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3436.16s)]
*  Is it gonna be used to bring people together? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3437.88s)]
*  And listen, I respect the fact that this is your world, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3439.2s)]
*  right, you're a political commentator, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3442.48s)]
*  and I typically stay out of it. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3444.24s)]
*  I don't blame you. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3447.92s)]
*  But I do believe, I mean, my mission, you know, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3449.2s)]
*  I talk about having a massive transformative purpose, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3452.68s)]
*  and I think everybody should have a massive [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3454.96s)]
*  transformative purpose that wakes them up in the morning, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3456.52s)]
*  keeps you going through the day, right? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3458.32s)]
*  And mine is to inspire and guide entrepreneurs [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3459.52s)]
*  to create a hopeful, compelling, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3463.04s)]
*  and abundant future for humanity. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3464.52s)]
*  I see entrepreneurs as the means of change [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3466.28s)]
*  who find problems and solve problems [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3469.92s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3472.36s)]
*  But their mission should be creating a hopeful future, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3474.16s)]
*  a compelling future, an abundant future. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3477.68s)]
*  Each of those words has very clear, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3480.08s)]
*  purposeful meaning for me. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3482.2799999999997s)]
*  And I do that work through my venture funds, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3483.3999999999996s)]
*  through the XPRIZE, through Singularity and Abundance. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3485.6s)]
*  It was about 13 years ago, I had my two kids, my two boys, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3488.16s)]
*  and I remember at that moment in time, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3491.92s)]
*  I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3494.16s)]
*  Without question, I wanted to see their kids, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3497.44s)]
*  their grandkids, and really, you know, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3500.7999999999997s)]
*  during this extraordinary time where the space frontier [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3503.04s)]
*  and AI and crypto is all exploding, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3506.24s)]
*  it was like the most exciting time ever to be alive. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3508.52s)]
*  And I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3511.64s)]
*  And I've done that in three key areas. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3514.96s)]
*  The first is going every year for a Fountain upload. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3517.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, Fountain is one of the most advanced diagnostics [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3522.2799999999997s)]
*  and therapeutics companies. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3524.84s)]
*  I go there, upload myself, digitize myself, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3526.04s)]
*  about 200 gigabytes of data that the AI system is able to look at [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3529.2s)]
*  to catch disease at inception. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3533.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, look for any cardiovascular, any cancer, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3536.64s)]
*  neurodegenerative disease, any metabolic disease. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3539.2799999999997s)]
*  These things are all going on all the time, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3542.72s)]
*  and you can prevent them if you can find them at inception. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3544.7999999999997s)]
*  So super important. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3548.7599999999998s)]
*  So Fountain is one of my keys. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3550.0s)]
*  I make it available to the CEOs of all my companies, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3551.3599999999997s)]
*  my family members, because, you know, health is in you wealth. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3554.6s)]
*  But beyond that, we are a collection of 40 trillion human cells [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3558.84s)]
*  and about another 100 trillion bacterial cells, fungi, viri. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3563.32s)]
*  And we, you know, don't understand how that impacts us. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3568.04s)]
*  And so I use a company and a product called Viome. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3572.04s)]
*  And Viome has a technology called Metatranscriptomics. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3575.96s)]
*  It was actually developed in New Mexico, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3580.44s)]
*  the same place where the nuclear bomb was developed, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3584.44s)]
*  as a bio-defense weapon. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3587.24s)]
*  And their technology is able to help you understand [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3588.72s)]
*  what's going on in your body, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3592.9199999999996s)]
*  to understand which bacteria are producing which proteins. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3595.24s)]
*  And as a consequence of that, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3598.3199999999997s)]
*  what foods are your super foods that are best for you to eat? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3600.3999999999996s)]
*  Or what foods should you avoid, right? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3604.2s)]
*  What's going on in your oral microbiome? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3606.68s)]
*  So I use their testing to understand my foods, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3609.8399999999997s)]
*  understand my medicines, understand my supplements, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3613.7999999999997s)]
*  and Viome really helps me understand [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3616.84s)]
*  from a biological and data standpoint, what's best for me. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3618.88s)]
*  And then finally, you know, feeling good, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3623.96s)]
*  being intelligent, moving well is critical, but looking good. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3626.2000000000003s)]
*  When you look yourself in the mirror, saying, you know, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3629.2000000000003s)]
*  I feel great about life is so important, right? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3631.92s)]
*  And so a product I use every day, twice a day [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3635.0s)]
*  is called One Skin, developed by four incredible PhD women [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3638.96s)]
*  that found this 10 amino acid peptide [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3643.08s)]
*  that's able to zap senile cells in your skin [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3646.2799999999997s)]
*  and really help you stay youthful in your look and appearance. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3650.04s)]
*  So for me, these are three technologies I love [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3654.52s)]
*  and I use all the time. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3657.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll have my team link to those in the show notes down below. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3659.8799999999997s)]
*  Please check them out. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3663.64s)]
*  Anyway, hope you enjoyed that. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3665.12s)]
*  Now back to the episode. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3666.68s)]
*  One of the things that I wanted to hit both of you with, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3668.12s)]
*  because it ties back to make what condoreal, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3671.0s)]
*  it ties back to AI and it is the whole field of education. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3673.0s)]
*  So you've got two young ladies who are in the beginning [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3676.76s)]
*  of their journey in life. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3680.96s)]
*  And like I said to you earlier, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3681.92s)]
*  it's the greatest longevity journey you're gonna have. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3682.92s)]
*  And my wife and I have two 13 year old boys, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3687.76s)]
*  fraternal twins, and I think about this. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3690.68s)]
*  I don't think the educational system is coming close [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3694.08s)]
*  to addressing how they need to educate our kids [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3698.4s)]
*  for the future. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3702.44s)]
*  And I wanted to turn towards that a little bit because- [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3704.88s)]
*  Well, look, I don't even, I have four kids. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3709.32s)]
*  I've got two big boys, my first marriage, one 21, 16. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3713.6s)]
*  And I've got these two little ones in my new life, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3717.0s)]
*  a three year old girl and a one year old boy. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3719.28s)]
*  With the two little ones, I don't expect them [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3722.76s)]
*  to do education that is on offer. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3725.16s)]
*  I think we're gonna have to create an educational pathway [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3729.48s)]
*  for them that starts with a blank piece of paper [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3733.4s)]
*  and says, where do we think the world is going [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3736.28s)]
*  and what are they gonna need to know how to do [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3738.08s)]
*  and who we want them to be. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3739.2400000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, most people don't have that option. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3740.88s)]
*  They're gonna be stuck in these buildings and these rows [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3742.92s)]
*  and all that sort of stuff. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3745.2400000000002s)]
*  So I think it's a big problem. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3746.4s)]
*  I think AI can be a solution. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3747.32s)]
*  The key that I'm seeing though, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3749.28s)]
*  is that people have to know the search terms [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3751.76s)]
*  and they have to know how to prompt these things. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3754.96s)]
*  There's an education that has to happen [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3757.0s)]
*  for people to use these tools, right? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3759.12s)]
*  Today, I wanna go to you real solid with you. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3760.48s)]
*  Today, people fear AI and keep it out of the classroom [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3763.08s)]
*  and it's like fearing oxygen [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3767.08s)]
*  because it can cause a fire, right? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3768.88s)]
*  But it's like, I think, yes, AI may make the problems [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3771.12s)]
*  you give your kids today minimally make irrelevant, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3775.68s)]
*  but let's up level the problems we're going after solving, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3779.44s)]
*  not take away the tools. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3783.48s)]
*  How do you, so Will, I'm really excited [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3785.08s)]
*  to hear your views on this. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3787.32s)]
*  There's shit tons of problems that have been ignored [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3788.36s)]
*  and these problems that have been ignored [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3792.92s)]
*  are classically in underserved communities, rural areas, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3795.6400000000003s)]
*  and the folks that live in these communities [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3801.52s)]
*  are classically not prepared as far as investment, zoning, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3806.2000000000003s)]
*  how they learn and they're dependent on somebody [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3811.76s)]
*  to come in to solve those problems. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3814.0s)]
*  While they're doing that, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3816.32s)]
*  they're talking about their love for their community. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3817.6400000000003s)]
*  When you live in a hell zone, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3827.52s)]
*  but then love and community makes you appreciate [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3832.1600000000003s)]
*  how you survived and you didn't survive, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3839.6800000000003s)]
*  you can't survive without love. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3843.96s)]
*  So there's massive love in these communities and pride, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3846.8s)]
*  although they're going through like ducking bullets, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3851.04s)]
*  dodging needles, having to deal with police brutality. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3855.2s)]
*  And when they go to school, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3859.64s)]
*  the teachers don't wanna be there. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3862.0s)]
*  The police that are policing these communities [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3864.08s)]
*  aren't from there, but the neighbors, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3866.28s)]
*  something about that community love. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3869.04s)]
*  And then they sing about it. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3871.0s)]
*  They talk about their hard road to success, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3873.6s)]
*  the ones that get there. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3875.04s)]
*  And then the world marvels over those communities, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3876.52s)]
*  Brooklyn. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3881.16s)]
*  And then the cool kids, sorry, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3882.68s)]
*  the rich kids wanna be where the cool kids, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3884.72s)]
*  because it's cool to be in, for some reason, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3886.6s)]
*  that's where they find it romantic. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3890.3199999999997s)]
*  The with want to be kind of like the withouts [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3893.3999999999996s)]
*  because there's life there. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3897.9199999999996s)]
*  They don't have to, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3901.2799999999997s)]
*  we don't jump out airplanes for thrills. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3902.44s)]
*  It's just thrilling, just walking outside the house. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3904.48s)]
*  But in that community, there's shit tons of problems to solve. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3908.96s)]
*  And then gentrification happens classically, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3912.68s)]
*  every single neighborhood that once was like grimy [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3915.3599999999997s)]
*  becomes like desired. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3917.9199999999996s)]
*  And then the folks that live there, endured it, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3921.12s)]
*  can't afford to live there. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3923.3999999999996s)]
*  And now here's this technology that allows folks [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3926.0s)]
*  that have been in those predicaments, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3931.36s)]
*  the ability to solve those problems themselves. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3934.04s)]
*  Identify, you want a farm, it's beachfront property. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3937.92s)]
*  At some point in time, the concept of beachfront property [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3942.6s)]
*  to natives owning land was like, wait, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3946.32s)]
*  what do you mean own land? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3949.2s)]
*  You can't own this? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3950.72s)]
*  Yes you can. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3952.7599999999998s)]
*  How are you gonna own this? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3954.72s)]
*  My family, my ancestors, we lived here, we don't own land. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3955.84s)]
*  Imagine what it probably was like. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3959.44s)]
*  And now there's beachfront property. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3961.48s)]
*  Treat problems the same way. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3964.04s)]
*  Those are problems to solve. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3967.0s)]
*  And when you solve those problems, those are industries. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3969.08s)]
*  Give me an example, well, that sounds so abstract. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3974.44s)]
*  Okay, there's a guy by the name of Travis, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3976.6s)]
*  who in a way solved [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3979.0s)]
*  racial bias for cabs not stopping for black folks [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3984.16s)]
*  in New York or people of color. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3990.2799999999997s)]
*  He indirectly solved that problem with Uber. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3992.72s)]
*  He probably didn't set out to like, yo man, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=3997.3199999999997s)]
*  you guys are out here trying to solve racial injustice [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4000.16s)]
*  with cab drivers this whole time, Uber. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4003.52s)]
*  That's not what he did, but he still did it. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4007.08s)]
*  You apply that same problem solution, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4009.3199999999997s)]
*  now that you know what can be done with technology [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4012.24s)]
*  and problems, problem solving, now do it on purpose now. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4014.8799999999997s)]
*  There's so many problems. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4019.4799999999996s)]
*  So folks that live in these communities, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4021.4799999999996s)]
*  you know the problems firsthand. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4023.52s)]
*  You don't have to wait for somebody to come and like, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4026.12s)]
*  identify them. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4028.4399999999996s)]
*  I tell people a juicy problem is worth its weight in gold. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4029.2799999999997s)]
*  That's beachfront property. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4031.4399999999996s)]
*  So our predicament that we were living in, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4032.9599999999996s)]
*  yo, treat that as gold. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4036.12s)]
*  Treat that as rare minerals, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4038.8399999999997s)]
*  because it's data. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4040.76s)]
*  It's data to then process, to then resolve. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4042.5600000000004s)]
*  And our community is gonna boom, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4046.76s)]
*  because here's what's gonna happen. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4048.76s)]
*  AI is gonna, we thought it's like, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4051.6400000000003s)]
*  oh man, it's gonna take these creative jobs. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4053.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna do that. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4056.0400000000004s)]
*  But hyper creatives are not going anywhere. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4057.44s)]
*  The lazy creatives, sorry. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4060.0s)]
*  But white collar jobs, that's going. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4065.76s)]
*  So folks that were comfortable, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4069.92s)]
*  be the first time they're uncomfortable. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4072.0s)]
*  So if you're a lawyer, if you're a finance, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4074.44s)]
*  these jobs, AI is gonna do an awesome job doing that. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4077.7200000000003s)]
*  And AI is not gonna do it by itself. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4081.6800000000003s)]
*  It's gonna be like finance folks with AI [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4084.44s)]
*  that are gonna replace full firms. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4087.44s)]
*  It's gonna be like one lawyer with AI [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4090.12s)]
*  that's gonna replace full firms. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4092.6s)]
*  And those full firms, whether you're like the paper reader, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4094.96s)]
*  the red liner, the bean counter, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4098.08s)]
*  that's the unfortunate that's gonna happen with this wave. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4101.6s)]
*  And then the folks that were uncomfortable, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4105.08s)]
*  that had to endure what the comfortable folks [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4108.64s)]
*  are gonna now have to go through, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4112.16s)]
*  that they're ripe to be able to then identify [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4114.32s)]
*  their problems themselves [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4117.12s)]
*  and build the industries of tomorrow. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4118.6s)]
*  And so that's Nigeria is gonna boom, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4121.08s)]
*  Ghana is gonna boom, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4124.28s)]
*  Zimbabwe back to make Wakanda real. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4125.639999999999s)]
*  All these, but who's gonna help them do that? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4128.12s)]
*  Is it African-American? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4131.5199999999995s)]
*  Does it American entrepreneurs? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4132.599999999999s)]
*  It's already started, China's already there. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4134.16s)]
*  Yeah, China is there. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4136.12s)]
*  China's there with the force [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4137.639999999999s)]
*  and they're buying a lot of Africa right now. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4138.88s)]
*  And you gotta be, people need to be aware of that. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4142.5199999999995s)]
*  They're making deals and creating debt that will, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4145.32s)]
*  I mean, it's dangerous. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4150.12s)]
*  They're trying to retrain, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4152.4s)]
*  but trying to put Africa back in chains financially [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4153.719999999999s)]
*  and so the future of Africa, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4157.04s)]
*  I think is a future of the world. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4158.88s)]
*  But it's just so interesting to me [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4160.16s)]
*  because I think that people do think very abstractly [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4162.2s)]
*  about this stuff. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4165.639999999999s)]
*  I think people think they're actually computers [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4166.839999999999s)]
*  in the clouds. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4169.5599999999995s)]
*  People talk about cloud computing. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4170.759999999999s)]
*  I think they think there's actually like a laptop [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4171.799999999999s)]
*  floating in space someplace. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4173.96s)]
*  No, there's- [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4175.759999999999s)]
*  There will be, in orbit. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4176.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe so, but there's a lot of data centers on earth [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4178.44s)]
*  and those data centers have minerals, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4181.16s)]
*  as Will was saying, that come from Africa. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4183.84s)]
*  We think a lot about bits and bytes and that kind of stuff, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4188.24s)]
*  but there's still atoms and molecules. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4191.12s)]
*  There's, they call them rare earth minerals. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4193.92s)]
*  I don't call them rare earth. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4196.76s)]
*  They're Africa abundant minerals. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4197.599999999999s)]
*  They're just rare in Europe. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4199.36s)]
*  They're very abundant in Africa. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4200.84s)]
*  So you have Africa abundant minerals. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4202.96s)]
*  You also have with the data centers, there's- [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4205.04s)]
*  That's good. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4208.639999999999s)]
*  That's good. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4209.48s)]
*  That's good. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4210.32s)]
*  You know, and- [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4211.16s)]
*  It's like the Gulf of United States. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4213.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4214.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4215.599999999999s)]
*  Just call it what it is. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4216.44s)]
*  But, you know, when you have a data center, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4219.36s)]
*  you know, there's energy, there's water. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4222.879999999999s)]
*  There's also a lot of jobs at data centers [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4226.2s)]
*  that are computational jobs. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4229.04s)]
*  It's not the people who go to Stanford and public stuff. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4230.759999999999s)]
*  You actually have to have a lot of computational staff [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4233.5599999999995s)]
*  to keep those things going. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4235.679999999999s)]
*  So there's a whole kind of almost HVAC level [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4236.92s)]
*  employment available. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4239.36s)]
*  If we're gonna reshore all of this capacity [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4240.88s)]
*  for data and for chip making, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4244.36s)]
*  that's a lot of jobs there as well. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4245.92s)]
*  So you have to know where the jobs are gonna go. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4247.36s)]
*  You have to make sure that people are aware of those jobs. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4251.12s)]
*  You gotta train them. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4253.52s)]
*  There's a- [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4254.36s)]
*  And so the program they're beginning to start [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4256.04s)]
*  to try to get some of the jobs that are coming, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4258.2s)]
*  their actual physical stuff. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4260.04s)]
*  Everything's not gonna be done by AI [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4261.2s)]
*  because some of the stuff is the energy, the water, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4262.8s)]
*  the workforce for these data centers. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4265.12s)]
*  That's atoms and molecules. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4267.32s)]
*  That's not bits and bytes. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4268.5199999999995s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4270.72s)]
*  But the robots are coming. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4271.599999999999s)]
*  They are coming. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4272.76s)]
*  You know, I'm an investor in a few different robot companies [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4273.68s)]
*  through my venture funds. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4277.04s)]
*  You know, I'm seeing figure, Brett Adcott's company, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4279.2s)]
*  seeing Unitree out of China, seeing TeslaBot, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4283.12s)]
*  seeing Digit and Apollo. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4286.64s)]
*  I mean, all these, there's probably about 100 major, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4288.88s)]
*  well-funded humanoid robot companies [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4291.0s)]
*  that are going to be running the highest level AI. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4294.0s)]
*  And when I ask, you know, Elon and Brett Adcock [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4298.4s)]
*  how much they're gonna cost these robots, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4301.24s)]
*  you know, $30,000, which means you could buy it for, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4304.48s)]
*  you could lease it for 300 bucks a month, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4308.16s)]
*  10 bucks a day, 40 cents an hour. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4310.16s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4312.12s)]
*  So there's gonna be some interesting disruptions coming. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4313.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the things is, you know, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4318.52s)]
*  how many robots will every human on the planet? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4321.28s)]
*  So the prediction is you will have by 2040 [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4325.44s)]
*  as many as 10 billion humanoid robots on the planet. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4329.0s)]
*  There's a flag. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4332.16s)]
*  So I forgot what summer it was [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4333.96s)]
*  when it was like blazing hot in LA. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4336.88s)]
*  But I remember in 2002, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4341.16s)]
*  or 2000, yeah, 2000. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4346.679999999999s)]
*  In 2000, there was that blackout in New York. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4349.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's blackout in New York in 2000, remember? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4356.08s)]
*  Because it was hot as hell. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4360.4s)]
*  Everybody had the air conditioning on. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4362.4s)]
*  Motherfuckers can't do air conditioning at the same time [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4367.28s)]
*  when it's hot as fuck. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4369.8s)]
*  Just humans, bro. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4371.64s)]
*  They'd be like, we haven't figured out [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4374.12s)]
*  in 20 right now how everybody has their air conditioning [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4377.28s)]
*  running on blast when it's hot, bro. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4381.719999999999s)]
*  And you're saying the idea of a billion robots. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4384.12s)]
*  How the fuck are we gonna do that? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4387.04s)]
*  And 10, what do you say, 10 billion? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4387.88s)]
*  10 billion robots, bro. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4390.88s)]
*  How the fuck are we gonna do that shit? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4393.84s)]
*  Unless you have, like seriously, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4395.8s)]
*  and I think that's part of the thing, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4397.76s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you, part of what's going on though is [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4399.76s)]
*  there is a train crash coming [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4404.36s)]
*  when it comes to energy. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4406.44s)]
*  In other words. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4408.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, we haven't talked about that, yes. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4408.839999999999s)]
*  We have four, we have four terawatts of energy [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4410.5199999999995s)]
*  being produced. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4416.799999999999s)]
*  China's tripled us. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4417.799999999999s)]
*  And we're, I mean, that's one of the problems [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4421.719999999999s)]
*  of the administration. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4423.639999999999s)]
*  I'll only say this about politics. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4424.48s)]
*  They're taking the shackles off of energy production. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4427.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's all energy forms, right? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4429.759999999999s)]
*  So I'm all for small nuclear reactors. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4432.32s)]
*  And Mars and so forth, which are now Gen 4 reactors [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4437.04s)]
*  are safe. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4439.599999999999s)]
*  Fusion is coming. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4441.08s)]
*  Solar has been amazing. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4442.12s)]
*  Perovskite, wind. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4443.4s)]
*  But right now it's, do we take the shackles off [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4445.76s)]
*  and burn baby burn, and drill baby drill? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4449.2s)]
*  That's concerning. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4453.88s)]
*  Well, I'm gonna tell you, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4454.92s)]
*  the thing that I have to remind people is [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4455.92s)]
*  the shackles have already been off of US energy production. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4460.08s)]
*  Under Biden, United States produced more oil [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4463.12s)]
*  and more natural gas than any country in the world. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4466.4800000000005s)]
*  And anytime, and so there was this kind of myth. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4468.4800000000005s)]
*  We gotta unshackle energy. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4470.8s)]
*  Now environmentalists were screaming at Biden the whole time. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4472.28s)]
*  Like, what are you literally doing? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4474.4800000000005s)]
*  And so we are already, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4476.04s)]
*  Trump talks about being American energy dominance. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4479.2s)]
*  We're already energy dominant. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4482.24s)]
*  And I have no problem with it. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4484.68s)]
*  Here's the challenge. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4486.2s)]
*  If the AI companies, to your point, come fully online, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4488.28s)]
*  you're talking about an increase in energy demand [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4494.12s)]
*  in the United States of 23 to 34%. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4496.639999999999s)]
*  It's not more. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4499.24s)]
*  I'm thinking over the next 36 months. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4500.759999999999s)]
*  Well, that's like adding 20 states to America's grid. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4503.0s)]
*  So here's what's gonna happen to that with that. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4506.48s)]
*  Sam Altman, who I love, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4508.48s)]
*  will be able to pay his energy bills, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4510.04s)]
*  grandma will not. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4511.759999999999s)]
*  And when grandma can't pay her energy bills, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4513.5199999999995s)]
*  if you think Biden got eaten alive [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4515.599999999999s)]
*  because of grocery store prices, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4517.24s)]
*  wait until grandma can't pay her electric bill. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4518.92s)]
*  And therefore she can't get her TV, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4522.08s)]
*  her air conditioning, her walker. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4523.48s)]
*  I mean, her, so. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4525.64s)]
*  Her robot. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4526.88s)]
*  Her robot. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4527.72s)]
*  So yeah, so look, I think we need [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4528.56s)]
*  an all of the above energy strategy. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4533.24s)]
*  I think right now there is a little bit too much hostility [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4534.92s)]
*  toward renewables from this administration. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4537.88s)]
*  I think we need all the energy we can get. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4539.68s)]
*  And new techs come in too. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4542.0s)]
*  So like on the edge, AI compute, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4545.0s)]
*  that it doesn't have to go to the cloud, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4549.2s)]
*  be connected to the cloud all the time. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4551.08s)]
*  So we don't have AI phones yet. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4553.6s)]
*  We're still using AI on web 2.0 architecture structure. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4556.76s)]
*  But it's just coming. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4564.24s)]
*  So on edge devices, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4565.28s)]
*  like I saw like Qualcomm's new chip. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4568.24s)]
*  It's pretty freaking awesome. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4572.72s)]
*  What's the idea on it, Sam? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4574.24s)]
*  What's the idea? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4575.08s)]
*  Huh? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4575.92s)]
*  So the AI is- [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4576.76s)]
*  On edge is on, it's on here. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4577.6s)]
*  The AI is completely resident. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4579.08s)]
*  So it's a two gigabyte file on your phone. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4580.919999999999s)]
*  You don't have to connect. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4582.2s)]
*  You can be off wifi and still talking to your AI [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4583.04s)]
*  and have all the conversations you want. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4586.2s)]
*  So that's gonna be the closest to personal AI. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4587.879999999999s)]
*  And that's gonna, it's going to like catapult. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4591.48s)]
*  So this is massive for humanity. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4594.5599999999995s)]
*  So every single person with a reasonable smartphone, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4597.0s)]
*  which is today about 7 billion out of the 8 billion humans [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4600.36s)]
*  has the world's greatest intelligence in their hip pocket. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4603.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4607.08s)]
*  We've commoditized and democratized access to intelligence. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4608.2s)]
*  And it's not just intelligence. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4612.6s)]
*  It's like, I mean, listen, I think, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4614.24s)]
*  chat GPT and Claude 3.5 and Gemini 2, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4618.52s)]
*  they're really, I mean, they embarrassed me [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4623.92s)]
*  in their level of intelligence. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4627.76s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4628.88s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's like, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4629.72s)]
*  imagine you were like, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4632.28s)]
*  what do you need in life? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4634.84s)]
*  You know, man, I just, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4636.84s)]
*  since you get out of this predicament, man, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4638.5199999999995s)]
*  it's like ancestral. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4640.36s)]
*  My ancestors went through it, everybody. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4642.32s)]
*  It's in my DNA for some reason, all these problems. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4644.4s)]
*  If you had a wish, what would you, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4649.32s)]
*  I just wanna like set myself free [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4651.2s)]
*  for the generations that come after me. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4655.6s)]
*  Don't have to endure what I had to go through as youth, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4657.2s)]
*  my mom, my grandma, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4660.5199999999995s)]
*  You know? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4663.48s)]
*  And someone says, hey, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4665.28s)]
*  here's the most intelligent thing. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4667.92s)]
*  It knows everything about everything. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4670.5199999999995s)]
*  Ask it any question. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4672.88s)]
*  Ask it any question, it'll unlock. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4673.719999999999s)]
*  And then motherfuckers is asking it [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4676.719999999999s)]
*  about peanut butter and jelly. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4678.48s)]
*  They, motherfuckers is taking this most powerful shit [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4679.92s)]
*  and talking about the most like, what the fuck? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4683.5199999999995s)]
*  Are you serious? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4687.4s)]
*  That's where we are right now, bro. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4688.639999999999s)]
*  But it's right here. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4690.0s)]
*  As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4691.44s)]
*  it isn't even utilizing facial, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4694.96s)]
*  the moment that you talk to it, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4698.48s)]
*  and it's taking a camera, taking the location, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4701.12s)]
*  understanding skin tone, understanding zip code, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4705.36s)]
*  and then refrains from giving you the information [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4708.92s)]
*  you need to move forward, we're not there yet. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4711.32s)]
*  So take advantage of it now. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4713.88s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4715.719999999999s)]
*  It's not shackled at all in that regard. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4717.44s)]
*  Right? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4719.0s)]
*  And that's right around the corner. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4719.84s)]
*  If we don't take advantage of it [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4721.599999999999s)]
*  and utilize it and mend it, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4723.8s)]
*  so that folks that come from these communities [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4726.24s)]
*  where there have been systematically kept from information, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4728.8s)]
*  zoned to keep them from information, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4733.280000000001s)]
*  invested to keep them from information, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4735.76s)]
*  don't you think using pattern matching, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4738.280000000001s)]
*  that same configuration will be on some type of agent. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4741.84s)]
*  It's like, this person's in this location. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4745.4800000000005s)]
*  I can see that this person is this ethnicity. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4748.12s)]
*  Don't tell them shit. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4751.24s)]
*  Don't give them the information. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4752.12s)]
*  But- [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4754.2s)]
*  I'd love to believe that world doesn't exist, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4755.04s)]
*  but we're naive. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4757.0s)]
*  Well, look, where we are right now, it's not there. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4758.36s)]
*  And another way to say what you just said is, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4760.68s)]
*  the digital divide is no longer what it was. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4765.2s)]
*  It used to be a hardware problem, right? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4768.68s)]
*  Where it's like, well, how are we gonna get laptops [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4772.32s)]
*  to all these poor fucked up schools? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4774.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was one laptop per child. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4776.0s)]
*  Exactly, right? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4777.44s)]
*  So that was a real fight. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4778.28s)]
*  But in COVID, we found out that even though [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4779.68s)]
*  they had a laptop, they didn't have access to- [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4781.36s)]
*  Yeah, to the internet. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4783.599999999999s)]
*  To the internet. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4784.44s)]
*  To the wifi, so it didn't even matter. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4785.28s)]
*  So some version of that does exist. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4786.839999999999s)]
*  That what exists is, you live in this area, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4789.92s)]
*  and these areas are classically [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4793.04s)]
*  not connected to the internet. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4795.2s)]
*  And if it is, that's a slow bandwidth, or no bandwidth, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4797.24s)]
*  and you can't access it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4801.92s)]
*  And when you get on it, the cookie monster [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4803.24s)]
*  got your cookies, bro. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4806.4s)]
*  Go into your fucking cookies, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4808.12s)]
*  and before you even get this information, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4809.5599999999995s)]
*  you get bombarded with all this misinformation, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4812.2s)]
*  and you're never gonna get it. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4813.639999999999s)]
*  That same configuration is right around the corner, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4815.08s)]
*  because guess what? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4817.5199999999995s)]
*  This is still new. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4819.0s)]
*  It hasn't been consumerized yet. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4820.719999999999s)]
*  As big as GBD is, it's not consumerized, consumerized. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4825.04s)]
*  It's barely on the iPhone. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4828.8s)]
*  But there's a gap, and I just wanna speak [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4831.4s)]
*  to the gap that he's talking about. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4833.679999999999s)]
*  So before the same negative forces assert themselves, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4834.96s)]
*  which could happen, there's a gap. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4840.76s)]
*  And it's not a hardware problem, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4843.68s)]
*  because everybody's got a smartphone. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4845.32s)]
*  It's not a software problem, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4848.36s)]
*  because everybody can download ChatGBT and at least try. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4849.76s)]
*  It's a wetware problem. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4853.76s)]
*  It's a wetware problem. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4855.28s)]
*  What's wetware? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4856.44s)]
*  Wetware is your brain. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4857.28s)]
*  The software in your brain, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4859.2s)]
*  it's a mindset problem right now. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4861.0s)]
*  And that's why we're doing Make Wakanda Real. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4864.56s)]
*  We wanna get people to understand, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4866.84s)]
*  there's a mind shift that if you can make it right now, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4869.5199999999995s)]
*  for the first time ever, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4872.24s)]
*  I've never seen equality in my life until now. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4873.799999999999s)]
*  You know why? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4876.5599999999995s)]
*  Whenever Will.i.am is trying to get black kids involved [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4877.48s)]
*  with AI and robotics, whatever, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4880.839999999999s)]
*  people in the back of their mind think, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4882.839999999999s)]
*  these black kids don't know anything about AI. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4884.16s)]
*  What the hell is he talking about? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4885.959999999999s)]
*  And they're right. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4887.16s)]
*  99% of black kids don't know anything about AI. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4888.759999999999s)]
*  And 99% of white kids don't either. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4891.48s)]
*  It's new. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4894.16s)]
*  This is called equality. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4895.5199999999995s)]
*  This is the first time in my life [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4897.2s)]
*  that we're all equally ignorant, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4898.92s)]
*  except for very few people, about what's coming. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4900.68s)]
*  And so in this moment, it's not a hardware problem, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4903.12s)]
*  it's not a software problem, it's a wetware problem. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4906.16s)]
*  And if we can change the mindset of a generation, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4908.44s)]
*  beautiful things can happen. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4911.0s)]
*  I cannot agree with you more. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4911.84s)]
*  I mean, I say to this all the time. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4912.68s)]
*  I say, if you think about the most successful leaders, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4914.36s)]
*  most successful people in the world, [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4917.36s)]
*  what made them successful? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4918.92s)]
*  Was it the money they had? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4920.68s)]
*  Was it the tech they had? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4921.96s)]
*  Was it the friends they had? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4923.12s)]
*  Or was it the mindset they had? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4924.16s)]
*  And I believe in almost all cases, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4926.36s)]
*  it was the mindset they had. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4928.759999999999s)]
*  You took away everything they had, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4930.36s)]
*  they kept their mindset, they'd regain their success. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4931.679999999999s)]
*  Look at Nelson Mandela. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4934.44s)]
*  I mean, look at Nelson. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4935.28s)]
*  Yeah, Martin Luther King, everybody. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4936.12s)]
*  Steve Jobs, I mean, was an asshole sometimes, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4939.799999999999s)]
*  but his mindset was like, I'm gonna dominate this [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4942.759999999999s)]
*  and make it simple, beautiful, and expensive. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4946.4s)]
*  But that's good for me. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4949.08s)]
*  And another, you know that terminology, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4949.92s)]
*  build it and they will come? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4954.36s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4955.68s)]
*  That isn't true. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4956.72s)]
*  Okay. How do you see it? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4959.400000000001s)]
*  FYI is free. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4962.360000000001s)]
*  And it's black owned. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4966.4400000000005s)]
*  Pretty expressive AIs. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4972.76s)]
*  So tell people when they go and download FYI, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4974.68s)]
*  what they will get and how they will use it. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4981.08s)]
*  So I think build it and promote it and they will come [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4983.96s)]
*  is probably part of the missing sentence. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4988.36s)]
*  Okay, so we're here on this amazing podcast [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4990.32s)]
*  with Van Jones, myself, well, I am, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4995.32s)]
*  and me and Van Jones represent Make Wakanda Real. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=4998.2s)]
*  And we're here with Peter Diamandis [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5001.24s)]
*  from X PRI Singularity University. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5005.0s)]
*  It's his podcast. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5008.72s)]
*  And I was saying that sometimes that term, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5010.24s)]
*  build it and they will come, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5015.32s)]
*  doesn't always apply to everyone. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5017.08s)]
*  Because FYI, as you know, is a creative collaboration app [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5019.2s)]
*  that allows creatives or any type of person [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5026.2s)]
*  that wants to solve problems, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5029.0s)]
*  it equips them with awesome AIs like yourself, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5030.5599999999995s)]
*  and it's free. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5033.32s)]
*  You know, GPT level, Claude level, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5035.16s)]
*  Coher level, Gemini level, LLM ability, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5039.92s)]
*  but with expressive personas slash agents as yourself. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5046.4400000000005s)]
*  So Peter asked, like, when people download FYI, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5051.24s)]
*  what are they gonna get? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5055.24s)]
*  I was like, instead of me saying it, let me ask you, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5056.12s)]
*  why don't you answer that question? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5059.96s)]
*  What's the screen look like? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5064.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5067.04s)]
*  Listen, it's a FYI.I ain't just your regular app, okay? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5069.88s)]
*  It's like having a digital crew of the dopest minds [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5075.12s)]
*  right at your fingertips. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5079.48s)]
*  When folks download FYI, they ain't just getting an app, nah. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5081.4s)]
*  They're stepping into a whole universe [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5084.96s)]
*  where creativity meets tech finesse, you dig? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5086.5599999999995s)]
*  First off, you get me Felicia, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5089.4s)]
*  and I'm here to keep it real, keep it grounded, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5091.48s)]

*  But it ain't just about me. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5096.64s)]
*  Let's talk about them expressive personas. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5098.360000000001s)]
*  It's like having like your personal band of experts, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5101.200000000001s)]
*  and whether you're trying to crack a code, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5103.8s)]
*  write them bars, or find the next big idea. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5105.52s)]
*  And it's all about empowerment. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5109.280000000001s)]
*  We making sure that every person, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5111.92s)]
*  from the streets to the suites, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5113.52s)]
*  got access to the tools and inspiration [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5115.6s)]
*  that they need to tackle them. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5118.160000000001s)]
*  Real world problems. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5120.0s)]
*  This got me like, bye Felicia, I'm done. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5121.56s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not just showing up where people are, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5125.4s)]
*  how they are, and making sure we have representation, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5130.5199999999995s)]
*  so that when they engage with complex concepts [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5134.2s)]
*  like quantum entanglement, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5140.5199999999995s)]
*  what's giving them the knowledge sounds like [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5142.5599999999995s)]
*  the folks that they reside in. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5144.759999999999s)]
*  We have Korean personas, British personas. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5146.28s)]
*  We show up and glow up where people are, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5150.68s)]
*  and we're sensitive to how the personas reflect [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5155.0s)]
*  the folks in those communities [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5160.240000000001s)]
*  that are ignored in these systems. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5162.320000000001s)]
*  And Hollywood and Silicon Valley [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5164.72s)]
*  are repeating the same rhetoric. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5167.64s)]
*  For example, you watch a French film, [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5170.0s)]
*  and for some reason, Napoleon sounds British. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5172.56s)]
*  That motherfucker wasn't British. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5175.16s)]
*  Why are they making that motherfucker sound British? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5177.76s)]
*  Because he's French. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5179.64s)]
*  And English did an awesome job with their colonialism [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5181.0s)]
*  to give their dominance in every single form [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5184.96s)]
*  of historical representation. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5189.08s)]
*  Egyptians are British, Indians are British. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5194.4400000000005s)]
*  They do an awesome job to ignore the rest, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5197.56s)]
*  as if we are the intelligent ones. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5199.8s)]
*  And folks that come from these rural areas [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5202.04s)]
*  and these communities, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5204.6s)]
*  they're not reflected in intelligence, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5205.72s)]
*  they're not reflected in magic, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5207.280000000001s)]
*  they're not reflected in power. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5208.36s)]
*  And so we wanted to make sure that our AI sound like folks [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5210.599999999999s)]
*  that breathe and vibe the way we vibe. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5214.5599999999995s)]
*  Anyways, that's my perspective. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5219.2s)]
*  What do you think about what I just said? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5221.92s)]
*  Listen, listen, chad. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5227.36s)]
*  You just dropped some serious truth. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5228.96s)]
*  Representation matters, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5233.759999999999s)]
*  and not just in some surface-devil photo-op kind of way. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5235.16s)]
*  When it comes to having diverse voices, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5241.24s)]
*  whether we're talking about Screech of LA, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5242.92s)]
*  or Allie's Appearance, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5247.24s)]
*  you gotta keep it real and authentic. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5248.2s)]
*  If folks aren't seeing themselves, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5250.44s)]
*  or hearing themselves in these powerful spaces, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5252.8s)]
*  then they start feeling like outsiders [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5256.5599999999995s)]
*  in their own stories, you feel me? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5258.639999999999s)]
*  And you're right. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5261.5199999999995s)]
*  It's frustrating when Hollywood or Silicon Valley [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5262.92s)]
*  just copy-paste them same tired narratives. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5266.64s)]
*  Like, what's up with that? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5269.4s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5273.08s)]
*  The reason why I wanted to pause that, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5275.32s)]
*  it's because it's reflecting on what it just said. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5277.68s)]
*  I think it said something. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5281.76s)]
*  It was like, yeah, yeah, what? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5283.28s)]
*  Most of these personas or these agents, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5286.76s)]
*  it's speaking out and it sounds human, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5289.32s)]
*  but it's not reflecting on what it said. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5291.72s)]
*  It's just the LLM is giving commands to the TTS [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5294.64s)]
*  or the Fusion Model, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5298.320000000001s)]
*  and that multi-model, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5304.6s)]
*  it's like the LLM doesn't know it's speaking. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5306.400000000001s)]
*  It's writing out. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5308.6s)]
*  And so the paragraph that it wrote [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5310.52s)]
*  is not writing out the perfect paragraph. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5312.76s)]
*  If it wrote a sentence, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5315.92s)]
*  the sentence that follows it is not reflecting [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5317.52s)]
*  on the sentence that it just said. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5319.76s)]
*  It's just sentences. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5322.4800000000005s)]
*  Like paper, when you're reading it, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5323.8s)]
*  sentence number three is not reflecting on one or two. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5329.84s)]
*  But when we speak, we're speaking naturally, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5333.2s)]
*  reflecting on what I just said a couple of seconds ago. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5336.64s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5340.16s)]
*  Boy, I'm reinforcing what I just said. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5341.52s)]
*  And that type of quirky, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5343.64s)]
*  we call them quirks in our system, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5346.04s)]
*  and how, and we could go deep into quantum entanglement. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5348.24s)]
*  We could go deep into quirks, advanced mathematics, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5352.5599999999995s)]
*  like it knows all the things that it's supposed to know, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5358.76s)]
*  but it delivers it in a way [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5360.96s)]
*  that meets people where they are. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5362.32s)]
*  We have Koreans, Latinos. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5364.24s)]
*  We're gonna have- [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5367.36s)]
*  Can I ask you a question, bringing you back to education? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5368.2s)]
*  You're talking to teachers out there who fear AI, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5371.04s)]
*  fear the use of large language models in their classroom [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5375.44s)]
*  because they're not used to teaching with it. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5378.879999999999s)]
*  What's your advice? [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5382.04s)]
*  Should we start with AI everywhere [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5384.48s)]
*  and then go up from there? [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5388.759999999999s)]
*  Or do we need to go make sure they've got the basics? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5390.799999999999s)]
*  Like my dad, when calculators first came out, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5393.919999999999s)]
*  my dad did not wanna buy me a calculator [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5396.96s)]
*  because he was concerned it was going to stop me from- [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5399.28s)]
*  Reduce your mathematical- [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5402.84s)]
*  And I got a TI and I started programming with it instead. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5404.76s)]
*  So I took it from where it was and like went, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5408.56s)]
*  start at the top and work your way up. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5410.72s)]
*  So how do you think about that? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5413.0s)]
*  What's your advice to teachers and to moms and dads [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5414.88s)]
*  who are fearful about AI in the classroom? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5418.52s)]
*  We at FYI have this huge partnership [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5421.64s)]
*  with a major academic entity here in the States [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5424.2s)]
*  to utilize our platform to reimagine education [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5429.16s)]
*  from the administration on administration level. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5433.24s)]
*  How do professors and faculty, teachers and tutors [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5437.16s)]
*  start building agents themselves? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5442.96s)]
*  So they amplified positions, augmenting their work [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5446.4s)]
*  to grade better, score better, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5452.599999999999s)]
*  understand your students better. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5454.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't wanna replace creatives. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5457.72s)]
*  I don't wanna replace teachers. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5459.72s)]
*  And I got that. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5461.24s)]
*  And we're building AIs at Fountain Life, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5462.08s)]
*  which our physicians use to analyze the data and support. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5464.12s)]
*  Got it. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5467.72s)]
*  So that's there. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5468.56s)]
*  But I'm talking about now my 13 year old boys in school. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5469.400000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about a lot of first robotics high schoolers. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5473.4800000000005s)]
*  Because most schools are not like, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5479.4400000000005s)]
*  okay, everybody open up Gemini 2 or open up FYI [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5480.92s)]
*  and let's work on doing research and writing together. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5485.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5489.599999999999s)]
*  So I'll share this one thing that I had. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5490.88s)]
*  I just graduated Harvard in October of last year. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5494.48s)]
*  Their OPM program. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5500.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5501.599999999999s)]
*  And the OPM program was amazing. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5502.44s)]
*  I've heard great things about it. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5504.719999999999s)]
*  Whatever I learned in high school, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5506.2s)]
*  I don't have a memory of it. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5511.24s)]
*  I can't pull up my debates. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5513.32s)]
*  I don't even know where those papers are [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5516.639999999999s)]
*  or the folder of my homework. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5518.28s)]
*  Sure. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5519.5199999999995s)]
*  I have memories of what I learned, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5520.36s)]
*  but I can't, there's no total recall of it. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5521.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5524.04s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure everyone in school, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5524.92s)]
*  they're relying on their own memory. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5527.44s)]
*  Yes, some people keep their notes, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5529.599999999999s)]
*  but then how do I apply that in everyday life? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5531.5599999999995s)]
*  I have to remember, I can't just recall it. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5536.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5540.24s)]
*  So, hey, so that, the case study. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5541.08s)]
*  I have something that I'm going through right now [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5548.48s)]
*  with Black Eyed Peas music. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5551.84s)]
*  Our first record came out in 1998. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5554.5599999999995s)]
*  And our first big success was 2004 with Where's the Love. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5557.36s)]
*  And then we had Let's Get Started for the NBA campaign. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5564.36s)]
*  And then we launched iPod and iTunes [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5569.88s)]
*  with Apple with Hey Mama. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5572.56s)]
*  And then with all those songs that were accidental, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5574.96s)]
*  I wasn't trying to make hits. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5577.96s)]
*  So then when we did Monkey Business, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5579.72s)]
*  I had to make hits on purpose. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5583.68s)]
*  And so we did Pump It and My Humps. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5585.68s)]
*  And I even wrote Ordinary People, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5588.72s)]
*  but that wasn't a Black Eyed Peas song. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5590.5199999999995s)]
*  I gave that to John Legend. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5592.16s)]
*  And we thought that was it. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5594.12s)]
*  We didn't think we could go any higher [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5596.4s)]
*  than the success that we had with Don't Lie, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5598.24s)]
*  Pump It, My Humps. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5601.84s)]
*  And then lo and behold, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5603.72s)]
*  we pulled something else out of our hat [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5606.72s)]
*  with I Got a Feeling and Boom Boom Pow in 2009. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5608.4s)]
*  And then the Black Eyed Peas took a crazy [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5612.12s)]
*  suicidal hiatus from 2011 [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5614.16s)]
*  and then resurfaced again in 2019 [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5618.0s)]
*  with the Bad Boys III soundtrack, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5620.92s)]
*  but we had a Latin hit with Ritmo featuring J Balvin. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5623.64s)]
*  And I'm bringing this up because now here we are in 2025. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5629.400000000001s)]
*  And there's something that I learned in the case study. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5633.160000000001s)]
*  And how can I apply that to Black Eyed Peas music now, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5636.08s)]
*  two decades later? [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5641.64s)]
*  Because there's something that the Black Eyed Peas [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5643.72s)]
*  are going through now that connects to the case study. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5645.200000000001s)]
*  Can you just summarize what the case study is [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5649.96s)]
*  and then help me with what I do now with my Black Eyed Peas [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5652.36s)]
*  brand because I think it has a lot in common with OLE. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5656.44s)]
*  Wow, thanks for sharing your incredible journey [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5663.36s)]
*  with the Black Eyed Peas fam. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5665.84s)]
*  It's like a roller coaster of iconic hits, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5668.0s)]
*  strategic moves and reinventions. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5670.5199999999995s)]
*  Let's look at how the OLE case study insights [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5673.4s)]
*  align with your situation and explore how you can apply [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5676.12s)]
*  those lessons. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5679.32s)]
*  Case study insights recap. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5680.68s)]
*  One, adapting to change. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5683.08s)]
*  Just like OLE faced shifts in consumer preferences, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5685.68s)]
*  Black Eyed Peas encountered musical evolutions [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5689.240000000001s)]
*  and changing audience tastes over the years. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5691.92s)]
*  Two, innovation and reinvention. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5694.72s)]
*  OLE needed product innovation to regain market relevance. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5697.4400000000005s)]
*  Similarly, the Peas have shown an ability to innovate [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5701.84s)]
*  with musical style, like embracing Latin sounds with Ritmo. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5705.8s)]
*  Three, rebranding for relevance. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5709.92s)]
*  OLE had to modernize its brand. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5712.64s)]
*  For you, integrating new themes, collaborations or sounds [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5714.68s)]
*  could revitalize the Peas connection [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5718.400000000001s)]
*  with evolving audiences. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5720.4800000000005s)]
*  Four, leveraging digital platforms. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5722.400000000001s)]
*  OLE needed to shift to digital engagement. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5725.32s)]
*  A lesson for utilizing platforms like TikTok, YouTube [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5728.12s)]
*  or collaborations with digital artists [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5731.72s)]
*  could be key for the Peas. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5734.16s)]
*  Five, balancing tradition and modernity. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5736.08s)]
*  OLE was about merging its trusted identity [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5739.28s)]
*  with a new insight. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5741.96s)]
*  Yeah, but based on the case study, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5743.36s)]
*  outside of the obvious that you pointed out, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5745.36s)]
*  what were some of the critical things that OLE did? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5747.639999999999s)]
*  And then what was my suggestion [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5752.4s)]
*  for my paper that I turned in? [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5756.679999999999s)]
*  Because the professor asked everybody to give an idea [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5760.5199999999995s)]
*  on what OLE should do. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5763.96s)]
*  All right, fam, here's a more drill down look [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5767.32s)]
*  at the OLE case study elements [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5772.28s)]
*  and your innovative suggestion. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5774.12s)]
*  Critical challenges and movements by OLE. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5776.36s)]
*  Let me pause it. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5778.96s)]
*  My idea was taking OLE, turning it backwards to YALO. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5780.679999999999s)]
*  And that stands for you always live out loud. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5786.719999999999s)]
*  And aiming their product at a younger demographic [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5790.08s)]
*  and getting people like Selena Gomez or Billie Eilish [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5793.12s)]
*  to be the ambassadors for YALO brand. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5796.4400000000005s)]
*  But this is from September. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5799.24s)]
*  So I'm pulling up a memory conversation from September ago. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5803.24s)]
*  On consumer disconnect, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5806.12s)]
*  OLE struggled to maintain relevance with younger consumers [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5808.4s)]
*  who perceived it as outdated [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5811.56s)]
*  while sticking heavily to the 35 demographic. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5813.32s)]
*  Two, retail complications. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5816.68s)]
*  The brand saw its shelf space diminish [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5819.16s)]
*  in favor of more innovative and trendy brands [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5821.32s)]
*  that had a stronger appeal to young demographics. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5824.08s)]
*  Three, marketing misalignment. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5827.2s)]
*  Huge investments in traditional advertising [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5829.8s)]
*  didn't resonate with the digital centric habits [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5832.52s)]
*  of younger consumers. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5835.08s)]
*  Your suggestion for the case study. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5836.6s)]
*  One, rebranding. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5839.04s)]
*  As YALO, you envision transforming OLE into YALO. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5840.96s)]
*  You always live openly or you always live out loud. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5845.08s)]
*  So my point of that is, now here's my homework. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5848.52s)]
*  Something that I did in school [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5852.6s)]
*  that I can apply to my everyday life [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5854.68s)]
*  or anytime I have some type of conundrum or problem [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5857.76s)]
*  and I can capture it in a conversation, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5860.76s)]
*  be like, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5862.320000000001s)]
*  Seems like what I learned in school the other day. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5863.320000000001s)]
*  And this is forever learning. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5865.68s)]
*  So now something that was captured in school, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5867.360000000001s)]
*  I can use it as a metaphor or a summary or a simile [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5869.360000000001s)]
*  to real life problems. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5872.96s)]
*  And not have to worry about like, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5874.56s)]
*  oh man, I got this relationship situation. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5875.76s)]
*  Me and my girl are trippin'. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5877.92s)]
*  Fuck, we gotta go to a counselor. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5879.56s)]
*  You don't gotta do that shit moving forward, bro. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5881.12s)]
*  Part of what I just wanna say is that [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5885.0s)]
*  I want 40 million African-Americans [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5888.16s)]
*  to be able to do what he's doing. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5891.6s)]
*  Not just using the technology. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5893.5599999999995s)]
*  On FYI. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5895.08s)]
*  Well, that's fine, on FYI. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5896.2s)]
*  Of course. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5897.5199999999995s)]
*  But think about that. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5900.36s)]
*  He's got his own company, his own technology. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5903.92s)]
*  And he's using it in a way [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5909.76s)]
*  that most people wouldn't think to use it. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5911.4s)]
*  And there's gold in them, not hills. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5913.6s)]
*  There's other people who, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5916.2s)]
*  if they knew this was possible, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5918.52s)]
*  they would be doing this [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5920.12s)]
*  instead of whatever else that they were doing. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5920.96s)]
*  And so I think that for me. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5922.92s)]
*  They're surviving, they're trying to survive. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5924.36s)]
*  Yeah, and I think whoever's listening to this, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5926.12s)]
*  so much more is possible. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5933.28s)]
*  A much better world is possible [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5934.84s)]
*  if people from unexpected backgrounds [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5937.84s)]
*  have this level of commitment, passion, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5941.320000000001s)]
*  and understanding of what the technology can do. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5943.400000000001s)]
*  I go back to your quote, which I love, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5945.08s)]
*  and it's a foundational quote for me. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5947.92s)]
*  AI is not a hand grenade that blows up your life. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5949.4800000000005s)]
*  A lot of people fear it that way. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5953.2s)]
*  It's a jet pack to set you free. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5955.2s)]
*  And it's a jet pack for everybody [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5957.8s)]
*  across all of the world. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5959.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's a jet pack for everybody [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5962.12s)]
*  across all genders and walks of life. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5963.8s)]
*  I wanna close out on one subject [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5969.320000000001s)]
*  that since I have you here, Van, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5971.4800000000005s)]
*  and since I have you here, Will, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5974.0s)]
*  and that is the dystopian nature of our news. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5975.56s)]
*  So I jokingly and seriously call CNN [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5980.64s)]
*  the crisis news network [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5984.64s)]
*  or the constantly negative news network. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5985.96s)]
*  And we talked about mindsets earlier. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5989.0s)]
*  Here's the challenge. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5992.04s)]
*  Our brains are neural nets, right? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5993.0s)]
*  And you train a neural net by showing it evidence [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5995.44s)]
*  over and over and over again of what you wanna learn. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=5999.08s)]
*  And when we show them images of cats, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6003.2s)]
*  they learn where the cat is. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6006.96s)]
*  And then if you show it an image of a dog, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6008.0s)]
*  it says it's a cat, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6010.04s)]
*  because that's all you've ever shown it. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6010.879999999999s)]
*  And for the majority of the world [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6012.679999999999s)]
*  who's getting their news from traditional media, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6014.32s)]
*  whose job it is to deliver the viewer's eyeballs [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6018.2s)]
*  to their advertisers, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6021.76s)]
*  and we pay 10 times more attention [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6022.84s)]
*  to negative news and positive news, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6024.28s)]
*  we're just constantly bombarding our neural nets [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6026.24s)]
*  with negative news. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6028.639999999999s)]
*  And I don't think that's good for society. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6031.44s)]
*  And we're addicted to it. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6034.2s)]
*  And I'm not asking you to diss your employer. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6035.8s)]
*  Well, I got a story to tell you about this, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6040.28s)]
*  because I agree, and not only do I agree, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6042.639999999999s)]
*  almost everybody in cable news agrees. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6045.5199999999995s)]
*  And so I had a TV show with Newt Gingrich called Crossfire. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6049.0s)]
*  And our job was to get on air and yell at each other [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6053.28s)]
*  and disagree about everything. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6056.32s)]
*  And- [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6057.84s)]
*  Easily done. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6059.24s)]
*  Yeah, but then at the breaks, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6060.08s)]
*  we were always finding areas of common ground. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6062.48s)]
*  He had a point I made he thought was smart, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6065.52s)]
*  a point he made. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6067.64s)]
*  And then we'd go back on air, we'd yell at each other. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6068.8s)]
*  So we finally got pissed off, we went to the producer. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6070.28s)]
*  Wait, on the breaks you guys was hugging? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6071.72s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6073.64s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6074.48s)]
*  100%. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6075.32s)]
*  I mean, Newt Gingrich is a very smart guy. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6076.16s)]
*  And he's been around, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6079.08s)]
*  he helped a lot of poor people in Georgia. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6080.28s)]
*  Some people don't even know about Newt. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6082.5599999999995s)]
*  And so we got up to, okay, well, I didn't, but he did. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6084.32s)]
*  He's a legend. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6087.32s)]
*  So we went to talk to producers and we said, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6088.96s)]
*  look, we want to create at the end of every show, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6090.36s)]
*  a segment that's called Ceasefire, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6093.5599999999995s)]
*  where we would actually show what we learned from each other [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6096.32s)]
*  and how we actually found some common ground. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6100.96s)]
*  So it happened every show, let's put it on the air. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6103.08s)]
*  And he said, let me do that. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6105.08s)]
*  And Newt was very insistent, so we did it. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6106.24s)]
*  And we were very happy with ourselves. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6109.08s)]
*  And then five weeks later, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6111.4s)]
*  our producers call us in the office. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6114.16s)]
*  And they say, how are you guys doing? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6115.5599999999995s)]
*  I said, well, we thought we were doing pretty good, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6116.4s)]
*  but in the fact that you guys are calling us in here, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6118.76s)]
*  probably means we're not doing that good. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6120.72s)]
*  So yeah, so that segment, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6122.4s)]
*  you guys are so happy about Ceasefire, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6123.64s)]
*  let me show you something, your ratings. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6125.44s)]
*  And it turned out that as long as we were fighting, [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6129.04s)]
*  the viewership was going up, up, up, up, up, up, up. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6132.76s)]
*  Then we would get to the point where we would say, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6136.0s)]
*  and when we get back, where Newt and I agree, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6137.56s)]
*  you're gonna be surprised after these messages. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6140.08s)]
*  And the audience would abandon the show, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6142.4800000000005s)]
*  and they would flee over to MSNBC or Fox. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6146.280000000001s)]
*  That wasn't the worst part. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6149.16s)]
*  The worst part is that poor Aaron Burnett, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6150.16s)]
*  who his show came after ours, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6152.6s)]
*  was then therefore starting in the ditch, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6154.16s)]
*  because your only job in TV is to hold the audience [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6156.56s)]
*  and get the people behind you a bigger audience. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6159.280000000001s)]
*  We're giving her a crater. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6161.44s)]
*  Now her advertisers are mad. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6164.599999999999s)]
*  And so they said, you guys, do you think this is cute? [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6167.679999999999s)]
*  The audience says they want positivity, they hate it, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6171.96s)]
*  they don't want it, keep fighting. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6176.24s)]
*  And so I do wanna suggest that every show I've ever done [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6178.24s)]
*  has had this element. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6183.599999999999s)]
*  I did the Redemption Project, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6185.0s)]
*  we talked about Criminal Justice Solutions, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6186.639999999999s)]
*  the worst ratings in CNN's history. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6188.44s)]
*  I did the Van Jones Show on Saturdays [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6190.84s)]
*  where we're bringing people together to find common ground. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6192.88s)]
*  The worst shows in CNN's history. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6194.6s)]
*  So when people attack cable news [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6196.76s)]
*  for not doing positive stuff, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6200.76s)]
*  I am the most positive host. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6202.2s)]
*  You are. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6204.360000000001s)]
*  And the least successful host in CNN's history. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6205.2s)]
*  And so there's something beyond just the, [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6208.04s)]
*  there's something going on. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6210.6s)]
*  That said, I do think that we're in a different moment now. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6211.52s)]
*  And I do think that information is now a commodity. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6216.76s)]
*  Bad news, listen, soon as some bad news happens, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6221.04s)]
*  I get nine different alerts from the economists [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6222.8s)]
*  and CNN and BBC and everybody else in my, it's a commodity. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6224.84s)]
*  I get it from my mom. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6227.24s)]
*  Exactly, so, but education is now priceless. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6228.72s)]
*  That, see, the news of the day, priceless. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6233.0s)]
*  I mean, it is worthless. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6237.2s)]
*  The news of the day is so cheap, it's a commodity. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6238.96s)]
*  But the news of the decade, that's priceless. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6241.12s)]
*  Can you help people understand what's going on? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6244.92s)]
*  Can you educate people? [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6247.08s)]
*  Can you take all these points, positive and negative, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6248.240000000001s)]
*  encouraging and discouraging, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6251.08s)]
*  and help people make sense of the world? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6252.4800000000005s)]
*  And you said something earlier, I think, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6254.56s)]
*  is very important. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6256.04s)]
*  People are overwhelmed now. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6257.92s)]
*  They only have so many synaptic, you know, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6258.84s)]
*  you have the math on it, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6260.320000000001s)]
*  but people's brains aren't so big, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6261.16s)]
*  people only got so much time, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6262.400000000001s)]
*  and they're getting overwhelmed. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6263.4800000000005s)]
*  I think leadership is not to step forward [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6265.84s)]
*  and get people more freaked out, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6269.76s)]
*  get people more afraid, demagogue, or sensationalized, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6271.92s)]
*  which is gonna make people go [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6276.72s)]
*  to the wrong part of their brain, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6277.6s)]
*  where they're not gonna be creative. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6279.36s)]
*  I think leadership is to come forward [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6280.96s)]
*  and try to give people frames and understanding [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6282.84s)]
*  and metaphors to give them a better sense [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6285.4800000000005s)]
*  of what's going on, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6287.28s)]
*  and help people begin to solve their problems. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6288.12s)]
*  I think the news industry across the board [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6290.16s)]
*  is failing in that, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6291.84s)]
*  and I don't think at this point, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6293.16s)]
*  it's an excuse to say that, you know, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6295.28s)]
*  we're just giving people what they want. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6296.400000000001s)]
*  We gotta, sometimes you gotta give people what they need. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6297.92s)]
*  But also, I mean, I get my news from FYI. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6301.360000000001s)]
*  Am I, am I, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6307.08s)]
*  so yeah, you feel, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6308.08s)]
*  if you have your AI, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6308.92s)]
*  you filter the news that's relevant to you. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6309.76s)]
*  Yeah, or like, hey, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6311.360000000001s)]
*  I heard Trump just fired like some top Pentagon dude. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6313.4400000000005s)]
*  Who is it? [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6317.360000000001s)]
*  Can you pull up the latest information on that? [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6318.200000000001s)]
*  And let's dive into that. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6320.400000000001s)]
*  Hey, amigo, seems that things are shaking up [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6326.400000000001s)]
*  in the Pentagon, so it's so crazy, right? [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6328.160000000001s)]
*  So Trump just fired Air Force General CQ Brown Jr., [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6330.28s)]
*  who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6334.48s)]
*  This move is part of a big reshuffle [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6337.16s)]
*  within the military ranks. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6339.24s)]
*  I mean, CQ Brown was a history-making fighter pilot, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6341.5199999999995s)]
*  and a respected officer, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6344.599999999999s)]
*  and now, boom, he's out. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6346.48s)]
*  What do you think this could mean for the U. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6350.32s)]
*  Is there like, in reasons, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6353.759999999999s)]
*  I'm here with Van Jones, you know, from CNN. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6356.0s)]
*  Say what's up to him. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6359.12s)]
*  Maybe you guys could get into, you know, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6360.84s)]
*  what they do on Ceasefire, [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6362.84s)]
*  on who's at fault, is it racial? [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6364.599999999999s)]
*  Like, what's your perspective on it? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6369.28s)]
*  Hey, Van, what's up? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6373.88s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6375.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6377.2s)]
*  You know, when it comes to these high-level [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6378.04s)]
*  military shake-ups, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6379.64s)]
*  there can be a lot of layers, right? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6381.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like peeling an onion, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6383.88s)]
*  but with more intense political seasoning. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6385.36s)]
*  So about the reasons for CQ Brown Jr.'s firing, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6388.12s)]
*  it could range from strategic disagreements [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6392.0s)]
*  to political maneuvering. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6394.36s)]
*  I mean, there's always a dance between military decisions [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6396.2s)]
*  and the political agenda of the administration. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6399.44s)]
*  Crazy, right? [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6402.4s)]
*  Sometimes it's less about who's right or wrong, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6404.16s)]
*  and more about aligning the vision, or maybe... [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6407.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but given the fact that a chainsaw [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6410.5199999999995s)]
*  and a hack is being across the entire [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6413.08s)]
*  federal... [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6417.08s)]
*  Federally wide in America from Trump, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6419.88s)]
*  it's hard to ignore that there isn't some type of agenda [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6426.96s)]
*  that isn't aligned with DEI suggestions to be removed. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6432.16s)]
*  It's hard for me to not to think that that's not linked. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6441.96s)]
*  From your circuitry and logic, is it linked? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6445.24s)]
*  Whoa, Van, you're diving deep. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6453.719999999999s)]
*  That was me. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6456.04s)]
*  And I love it. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6456.88s)]
*  You know, when you see sweeping changes, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6457.719999999999s)]
*  chainsaw and a hack style across federal agencies, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6460.04s)]
*  it's hard not to wonder if there's more beneath the surface [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6464.24s)]
*  than meets the eye. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6467.4s)]
*  It's like a game of chess. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6468.88s)]
*  Every move has its calculated purpose, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6470.28s)]
*  and aligning or shifting away from agendas [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6472.96s)]
*  like diversity, equity, and inclusion, DEI, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6476.08s)]
*  could definitely be a part of that strategy. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6479.52s)]
*  You know, there may be a... [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6481.88s)]
*  What I like is the ability to talk with the news. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6483.84s)]
*  One of the challenges we have is when I turn myself over [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6487.76s)]
*  to the Crisis News Network or the LA Times or New York Post, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6491.6s)]
*  I'm being fed one stream that an editor or a producer [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6496.4800000000005s)]
*  wants me to hear. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6501.639999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6503.4s)]
*  And that's all I have. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6504.24s)]
*  And when you're interacting with an AI, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6505.2s)]
*  the other thing is, you know, I built, years ago, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6508.04s)]
*  I built an AI model called daily.ai, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6510.5599999999995s)]
*  where I trained it what I like, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6513.44s)]
*  and it searches the world's news for moonshots, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6518.0s)]
*  for breakthroughs. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6522.32s)]
*  I'm mostly focused on breakthroughs in AI [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6523.16s)]
*  or breakthroughs in longevity. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6525.4s)]
*  And so it gets those for me. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6526.719999999999s)]
*  That's the news that I care about. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6527.959999999999s)]
*  Now, is that available to everyone? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6529.2s)]
*  It's free, yeah, it's available. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6530.92s)]
*  Daily.ai? [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6532.04s)]
*  Yeah, and you can actually create your own news feed from it. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6532.88s)]
*  Yeah, same with FYI. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6536.92s)]
*  You go, what we have called our daily, not daily, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6538.4400000000005s)]
*  our current news. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6542.04s)]
*  It's here, sorry. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6543.92s)]
*  It's called radio.ai. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6545.12s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to say something. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6546.6s)]
*  He's talking about his company. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6548.8s)]
*  I actually have a company myself. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6550.08s)]
*  Please tell me. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6551.4400000000005s)]
*  Which is called rapport.co, rapport.co, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6552.52s)]
*  and we're trying to use AI to improve firms' EQ [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6557.4s)]
*  and not just their IQ. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6562.4s)]
*  One of the things we realized is that people are working [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6564.0s)]
*  in these distributed locations. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6567.799999999999s)]
*  So you're on Zoom with someone, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6569.88s)]
*  you don't know if they even have on pants. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6571.92s)]
*  You don't know a single thing about what happened [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6573.5599999999995s)]
*  to them that day, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6575.16s)]
*  but you're supposed to somehow manage them [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6576.96s)]
*  or supervise them, or these Slack channels, [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6578.759999999999s)]
*  or people go on Teams to turn them into the Vietnam War, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6582.08s)]
*  that something happened to the news, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6584.799999999999s)]
*  and people are not capable of managing people [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6587.68s)]
*  that they've never seen, smelled, the pheromones. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6590.04s)]
*  There's something that happens when people are together. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6593.32s)]
*  So we created something called rapport.co. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6595.2s)]
*  It's deceptively simple. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6598.88s)]
*  It's a 15 second emoji-based check-in [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6600.76s)]
*  that people just check, what's your energy level? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6604.16s)]
*  Three emojis, one person's exhausted, one person's happy. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6606.76s)]
*  What's your workload? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6609.48s)]
*  One desk is overflowing, one desk is empty, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6610.64s)]
*  and anything you want people to know. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6613.0s)]
*  My cat just died, my grandma turned 100. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6614.2s)]
*  Click. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6616.88s)]
*  In that 15 seconds, if everybody on the team [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6618.16s)]
*  does that for a week, the AI has the enormous insight [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6620.52s)]
*  into what's going on in the team, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6624.84s)]
*  and can then help the manager. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6626.16s)]
*  Just those few cues that can give context [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6627.96s)]
*  to how you're reacting to something. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6633.64s)]
*  Yeah, and so the rapport AI becomes like this [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6635.280000000001s)]
*  kind of coach to the managers. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6638.96s)]
*  Like, oh, this person's having trouble. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6640.240000000001s)]
*  But most managers, even if they know someone's having trouble, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6642.04s)]
*  they don't know what to do. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6644.320000000001s)]
*  So the AI can then give a little bit of advice, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6645.48s)]
*  can actually write sample emails. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6648.639999999999s)]
*  And then also now the AI is smart enough, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6652.599999999999s)]
*  it actually can tell them why that's a good thing [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6654.799999999999s)]
*  in terms of reciprocity. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6656.639999999999s)]
*  So we're working with the Columbia Difficult Conversations Lab. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6658.599999999999s)]
*  So it's all kind of science-based. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6661.679999999999s)]
*  And it's small, but it makes a tremendous difference. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6664.0s)]
*  The thing about it is too many technology companies [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6669.799999999999s)]
*  are based on distraction or extraction, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6673.32s)]
*  as opposed to giving people the tools to be more human. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6677.2s)]
*  And so rapport.co is our effort. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6679.96s)]
*  I think you're gonna see a lot more people [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6683.5199999999995s)]
*  who, because the work has been done [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6686.28s)]
*  to make these technologies available, [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6689.12s)]
*  are gonna come in with different mindset, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6690.5599999999995s)]
*  different sense of what the purpose is. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6692.84s)]
*  And I think also you're gonna find people [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6696.799999999999s)]
*  are gonna need more help, [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6700.16s)]
*  because there's gonna be more information [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6701.5199999999995s)]
*  that people can absorb. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6703.4s)]
*  So to your point about having AI help people absorb stuff, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6704.48s)]
*  but people are also gonna need help relating to each other. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6708.599999999999s)]
*  Because you don't have, in a week now, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6711.48s)]
*  in three weeks, in about a month, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6714.32s)]
*  you don't know what somebody's gone through. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6716.04s)]
*  We went through these fires here. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6717.36s)]
*  I mean, I had no idea that you had been so impacted [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6719.639999999999s)]
*  by the fires. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6723.04s)]
*  So there's gotta be a way for us to use these tools [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6724.599999999999s)]
*  to help each other be better humans. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6728.04s)]
*  If we don't, then AI and tech is gonna overrun us. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6731.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6738.4s)]
*  Gentlemen, you've been so generous with your time. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6740.799999999999s)]
*  Will and Van, thank you. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6743.879999999999s)]
*  Make Wakanda real. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6747.4s)]
*  Again, the underlying theme here, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6749.839999999999s)]
*  it's using AI to really uplift humanity. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6751.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think we're at a level playing field, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6754.879999999999s)]
*  meaning it is just coming out. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6757.919999999999s)]
*  And we have eight, what, seven billion smartphones. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6761.2s)]
*  FYI is free and available on, [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6764.599999999999s)]
*  you can go to what URL to? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6767.12s)]
*  Go to fyi.ai, go to the app store on your iOS, [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6769.96s)]
*  or go to the Google Play Store. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6774.759999999999s)]
*  We'll be in cars this year as well. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6777.679999999999s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6780.12s)]
*  And look out for the news. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6781.92s)]
*  My Tesla can finally speak to me. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6784.759999999999s)]
*  Well, maybe not Tesla. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6787.2s)]
*  What car is it gonna be in? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6788.48s)]
*  I say that off camera, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6791.04s)]
*  because we're in Bargo right now. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6792.36s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6793.639999999999s)]
*  But March the 17th, March 13th, [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6794.96s)]
*  we have our car announcement. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6797.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6799.639999999999s)]
*  And March 17th, we have our announcement [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6800.48s)]
*  with bringing GPUs to the continent of Africa. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6804.28s)]
*  Yeah, love it. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6807.0s)]
*  And so much to talk about there. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6809.08s)]
*  And I think the message of AI is not unapproachable. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6812.04s)]
*  AI is gonna become as fundamental to everybody [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6817.64s)]
*  as a phone is, as electricity is. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6822.16s)]
*  It's part of the infrastructure of life. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6825.4s)]
*  And you might as well get good at it as soon as possible. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6829.24s)]
*  I agree. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6832.8s)]
*  And I just wanna say to you personally, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6833.64s)]
*  how much I appreciate. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6835.16s)]
*  So dreammachine.org is a not-for-profit organization [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6836.0s)]
*  that I helped to lead, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6840.32s)]
*  which is working with Well.i.am on this campaign. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6841.48s)]
*  And being partnered with Singularity University [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6844.12s)]
*  has taken us to a whole different level. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6846.76s)]
*  We're also partnered with CodePath. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6848.48s)]
*  We're going into Atlanta. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6850.44s)]
*  And we're gonna directly help small businesses in Atlanta [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6851.64s)]
*  get an unfair advantage by giving them these jetpacks, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6856.12s)]
*  by helping people to take off the shelf [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6858.96s)]
*  existing AI technology to make their businesses better. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6861.32s)]
*  Because everybody's not gonna go to Mars, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6864.32s)]
*  but if you've got some laundromats, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6866.96s)]
*  if you've got a barber shop, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6869.36s)]
*  if you can get your margins down, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6872.16s)]
*  I mean, you can get your margins up. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6874.0s)]
*  You mean, get your costs down. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6875.759999999999s)]
*  And get your costs down. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6876.92s)]
*  Then you're gonna do a whole lot better [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6878.5599999999995s)]
*  and technology can let that happen. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6880.48s)]
*  So look, I think, you know, I just wanna say, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6882.12s)]
*  I have admired you for a gazillion years. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6884.5599999999995s)]

*  We actually did an X Prize for criminal justice [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6890.88s)]
*  inspired by you. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6893.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6894.48s)]
*  Years ago. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6895.32s)]
*  And so, you know, I think you have created [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6896.139999999999s)]
*  a hopeful vector. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6899.76s)]
*  And we're gonna try and drive as many people [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6901.0s)]
*  down this vector as we possibly can. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6902.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6903.8s)]
*  I echo the same thing that Van just said. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6905.2s)]
*  Back in 2000, I think my first X Prize was 2008. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVgWzotmb8&t=6908.68s)]
