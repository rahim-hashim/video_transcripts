# Uber Founder on AI, Risk, and Building the Future w/ Travis Kalanick | EP #164
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs)
*  Will robots and AI replace all of our jobs? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=0.0s)]
*  If somebody wants to go and make a thing that doesn't make people's lives better, they should [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=4.5s)]
*  count on failing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  In your seven-year tenure, zero to 70 countries, five billion rider trips, seven and a half [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=11.88s)]
*  billion revenues, a $70 billion valuation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=17.22s)]
*  I didn't think of it exactly like this at the time, but basically I was digitizing network [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=19.52s)]
*  for the physical world. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=24.32s)]
*  When you're trying to do something disruptive, there's a massive immune reaction that occurs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  One of the best ways to deal with resistance to change is to build a massive amount of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=29.74s)]
*  trust with those you're asking to change or that you're asking to bring along with that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=34.82s)]
*  change because then you can turn your adversaries into advocates. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=40.54s)]
*  Nobody's in control of the world, so you have to see into where the world is going and build [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=44.86s)]
*  for that world. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=53.14s)]
*  Now that's a moonshot, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=55.14s)]
*  This is a group of entrepreneurs running 10 million to $10 billion companies. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=67.56s)]
*  Their focus is on getting clarity on their massive transformative purpose and then using [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=72.14s)]
*  that for a moonshot to do something extraordinary, to go from success to significance in the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=79.44s)]
*  world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=84.84s)]
*  When we've talked about understanding the process of reinventing an industry, transforming [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=85.84s)]
*  it, making it efficient, I think there are only a handful of individuals that make that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=94.08s)]
*  possible or have done that successfully. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=101.24s)]
*  I want to read the numbers on Uber just as an example because I want to dive into the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=103.72s)]
*  founding of Uber and then obviously what you learned and building Cloud Kitchen as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=110.12s)]
*  In your seven-year tenure, zero to 70 countries, that's pretty impressive, five billion rider [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=116.48s)]
*  trips. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=123.48s)]
*  I don't know where that number came from. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=124.48s)]
*  It came from a chat GPT or some sites like that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=128.92s)]
*  When I left, so mid-2017, we're probably doing, I don't know, 130 million a week. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=132.92s)]
*  That would be like seven weeks for every billion. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=146.72s)]
*  Seven and a half billion in revenues, not bad, thereabouts. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=152.76s)]
*  Well, the gross at that time was probably about 50 billion. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=158.32s)]
*  That would be GMV and then how you calculate revenue from there could be tricky, but yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=162.32s)]
*  But a $70 billion valuation, not bad. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=168.56s)]
*  Can you take me back to that, first of all, that founding aha moment and then we talk [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=172.64s)]
*  about purpose as a critical part of building a company that's a moonshot company? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=180.2s)]
*  Yeah, the aha moment, I mean, it's kind of interesting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=186.32s)]
*  You hear a lot of the founder, what do they call them? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Founding fables, founding. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=196.4s)]
*  There's something along. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=198.32s)]
*  Yeah, the public sort of generates. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=199.32s)]
*  This whole made-up thing, we don't have one of those, but it sounds like one. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=201.64s)]
*  So we were in Paris, we were at, if you guys remember way back in the day in 08 and 09, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=208.44s)]
*  there was a Loic Lemur's Web Summit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=213.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=217.36s)]
*  I think it was called that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=218.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was one of them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=219.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=220.36s)]
*  And I was there in Paris, I was sort of in between gigs. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=221.36s)]
*  I had sold my recent company to Occamai and I didn't know what was next. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  So I was there with a guy named Garrett Camp and we were walking back before Uber in Paris. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=227.96s)]
*  You'd have to walk back. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  You would, I want to go faster here, but basically you had to walk home in Paris back in the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  day. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=244.32s)]
*  You go out to dinner, you're walking home. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=245.32s)]
*  That's just what it was. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=246.32s)]
*  And so we were on a three mile walk back to our hotel after dinner and he said, man, I [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=247.32s)]
*  wish we could just push a button and get a ride. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=255.48s)]
*  That's a prophetic wish. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=259.24s)]
*  And I'm like, pretty good. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=261.6s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, let's just go back to San Francisco, make the app. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=266.6s)]
*  Let's buy 20 S classes, get 40 drivers in a parking garage and we're off to the races. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=272.28s)]
*  I'm like, look, there's enough cars out there already. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=276.55999999999995s)]
*  We don't need to buy the cars. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=279.32s)]
*  We don't need to get a parking garage and we probably don't even need to hire the drivers. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=281.55999999999995s)]
*  And that was kind of the balance at the beginning was he was the classy and I was the efficiency, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  that makes sense. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=293.96s)]
*  Purpose. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=295.32s)]
*  We talked about this in advance. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=296.38s)]
*  How critical is purpose in driving sort of a company at this scale? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=299.84s)]
*  I mean, it's super important. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=306.0s)]
*  I think you could probably have a whole conference on purpose. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  So you could take it many different ways. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=313.79999999999995s)]
*  The first is I think every individual. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=315.84s)]
*  Sometimes I'll talk to executives where they're like making the move to the next thing, ideally [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=319.76s)]
*  the one I'm trying to recruit them for. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=324.2s)]
*  And my advice, even when I'm not recruiting them is you got to be really self-aware of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=327.16s)]
*  who you are. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=333.72s)]
*  If you get really, really self-aware of who you are, then when the next thing comes, you [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=335.88000000000005s)]
*  will know. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=341.72s)]
*  When your professional soulmate presents itself, you will know. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=343.88s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=348.24s)]
*  And so... [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=349.24s)]
*  If you're honest with yourself. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=350.24s)]
*  Yeah, you got to be. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=351.24s)]
*  So you got it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=352.48s)]
*  It's like, I shouldn't be running Pinterest. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=353.48s)]
*  Just wouldn't work out. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  But that's because I know myself. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=358.56s)]
*  And so if you understand your nature, you need to find a thing that you do that matches [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=362.92s)]
*  that nature. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=368.92s)]
*  So when we talk about your massive transformative purpose, what wakes you up in the morning, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=369.92s)]
*  what keeps you going, and that as the foundation for building a company that... [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  And then how does that translate then to your team that you build? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=383.44s)]
*  Well, before we even get into it, there's a couple more layers to it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=387.52s)]
*  I like to say my space is digitizing the physical world. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=393.32s)]
*  Let's say that's a sport that I play that I'm meant to play. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=399.4s)]
*  Meaning, if you play basketball and that's your thing and you're really great at it, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=402.28s)]
*  don't go play tennis. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=406.4s)]
*  So you got to know the sport. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=407.4s)]
*  Through that self-awareness, you know your sport. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  Digitizing the physical world, I'd also say innovation at speed and at scale. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  This is stuff that gets me fired up. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  And then the final layer is like, who are the people that I'm serving? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=417.24s)]
*  Whatever you're going to do, you're serving somebody. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=423.72s)]
*  You should be fundamentally passionate about them and what the thing you're going to do [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=426.56s)]
*  is going to do for them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=433.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's when, just in the nomenclature here, we talk about in your MTP, who are you [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=435.4s)]
*  serving? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=443.76s)]
*  Who do you want to be a hero to? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=444.76s)]
*  Everybody, I hope you're enjoying this episode. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=446.35999999999996s)]
*  Earlier this year, I was joined on stage at the 2025 Abundance Summit by a rock star group [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  of entrepreneurs, CEOs, investors, focused on the vision and future for AGI, humanoid [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=455.32s)]
*  robotics, longevity, blockchain. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=462.52s)]
*  And they're going to be the next trillion-dollar opportunities. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=465.16s)]
*  If you weren't at the Abundance Summit, it's not too late. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=467.88s)]
*  You can watch the entire Abundance Summit online by going to exponentialmastery.com. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=470.4s)]
*  That's exponentialmastery.com. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=476.4s)]
*  So you get clarity on that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=478.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=481.12s)]
*  And then you start building an organization. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=482.12s)]
*  And I guess the challenge is if you're bringing in people who don't share that, you're going [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=485.6s)]
*  to very quickly start going in the wrong direction. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=492.36s)]
*  And you get like a culture clash internal, is if there are people who don't see things [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=494.84s)]
*  the same way you do, at least the values. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  And look, most of us here have personal relationships of one kind or another, friends, loved ones, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=503.23999999999995s)]
*  partners in life, the whole thing. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=512.04s)]
*  And it's very similar. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=513.4s)]
*  Opposites can attract, but the core values you need to believe in, you have to share. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=516.04s)]
*  So how do you use that as a filter for who you're bringing in? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=521.04s)]
*  Are you dogmatic about it or are you allowing those who naturally gravitate that way to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=524.08s)]
*  come in? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=528.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, those two are, I think, very similar. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  So sometimes somebody who doesn't, who shouldn't, sometimes a tennis player goes to a basketball [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=534.36s)]
*  court and you're like, yo, whoa, we don't do rackets here. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=539.5200000000001s)]
*  We have this much larger ball that we put it in this hoop that's different. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=543.76s)]
*  So it doesn't have to be a judgment. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=551.0200000000001s)]
*  It's just an assessment, a factual sort of thing. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=553.08s)]
*  And so you have to understand what the values are and if the values are the same. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=558.1s)]
*  And again, it's those things that I just went through. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=562.48s)]
*  And this gets codified into sort of what you might call cultural values or things like [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=566.32s)]
*  this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=571.36s)]
*  And if your cultural values are really, really good, then it becomes really clear who's not [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=573.0400000000001s)]
*  supposed to be there. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=579.94s)]
*  You don't want to get to that place where it's not supposed to be there. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=582.4399999999999s)]
*  When somebody comes in, you want to make it work. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=585.5799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't always work, but you want to try to make it work. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=588.4s)]
*  But it becomes really clear, ideally in a recruiting process. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=591.8s)]
*  And if a mistake happens on the way in, it becomes clear super early, whoa, this is, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  I play tennis, not basketball. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  You said a few minutes ago that you are focused on sort of optimization, getting rid of inefficiencies. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=606.08s)]
*  And is that your sort of your superpower for finding opportunities? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, it goes to that digitizing the physical world. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=620.92s)]
*  So we know what the digital world is. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=625.02s)]
*  It's called a computer. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=627.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=629.48s)]
*  CPU manipulates the bits. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=630.48s)]
*  Storage stores the bits. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=633.2s)]
*  Network moves bits from point A to point B. These are like the three core computing resources [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=635.5600000000001s)]
*  in a computer. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=639.96s)]
*  But digitizing the physical world, if that's your sport, then you've decided that treating [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  atoms like bits is what you do. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=648.62s)]
*  So you go, OK, well, CPU manipulates the bits. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=651.1400000000001s)]
*  What manipulates atoms? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  That's manufacturing. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=656.12s)]
*  Storage stores bits. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=658.76s)]
*  What stores atoms? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=659.76s)]
*  That's real estate. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=661.64s)]
*  Network moves bits from point A to point B. What moves atoms? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=663.28s)]
*  You're like, that's logistics or transport. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=666.0s)]
*  So my last company, Uber, I didn't think of it exactly like this at the time, but basically [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=668.88s)]
*  I was digitizing network for the physical world. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=674.88s)]
*  Digitized transport, one of the three core computing resources in an atoms-based computer. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=678.96s)]
*  You're like, well, that's well on its way. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=684.28s)]
*  It's not all the way done. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=686.56s)]
*  We need autonomous cars and all of this to really be out there. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=687.56s)]
*  We've got light at the end of the tunnel. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=690.9s)]
*  But what about digitized manufacturing and digitized real estate? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=692.66s)]
*  And so that's how I see what I do. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=697.46s)]
*  So what I do is I make atoms-based computers. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=702.06s)]
*  And if you are treating atoms like bits, it will naturally be about efficiency. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=705.78s)]
*  It's very different than say, oh, I make a social media app. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=710.18s)]
*  A social media app is going to win when it takes your time, gets your attention, takes [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=712.66s)]
*  your time. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=719.22s)]
*  And that's how they make money. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=720.22s)]
*  Atoms-based computers typically are giving you your time back. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=722.7s)]
*  And so that becomes sort of the foundation of what it is I do. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=727.86s)]
*  We talked this morning about the idea of looking into your business and finding everything [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=734.1s)]
*  that's not been digitized yet and dematerialized yet. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=738.74s)]
*  As somebody is going to eventually do it if it's doable. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=743.5s)]
*  What advice do you have to folks about doing that? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=748.26s)]
*  Another part of it is companies that are born as digital native companies, like you bought [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=753.1s)]
*  Uber and those are trying to retrofit themselves. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=757.7s)]
*  Well, I mean, these are very different things. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=761.42s)]
*  So if you are digitizing a business that exists, let's assume that business is profitable, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=764.46s)]
*  has some sort of competitive mode, et cetera. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=771.58s)]
*  In some ways, the starting point is very straightforward. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=775.02s)]
*  It's like you just take all the line items where there are humans and you try to find [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=777.54s)]
*  ways to get more leverage on those humans. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=782.0999999999999s)]
*  So you start with customer support, account management, any workflow where people are [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=787.54s)]
*  doing things, filling in data, workflow type stuff. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=794.9399999999999s)]
*  That's the easy starting point. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=800.54s)]
*  It's not as innovative per se. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't get to the core product, but it's sort of how you start surrounding the core [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=805.62s)]
*  if you have something that's not digitized. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=810.5s)]
*  But the radical thinking is to really digitize it from the inside out is not always the domain [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=814.94s)]
*  of an existing profitable business with a competitive mode. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=823.02s)]
*  Usually doesn't have the DNA to do it again. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=826.54s)]
*  It sometimes does, but most of the time does not. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=830.78s)]
*  We didn't see Verme, other pre-existing transportation companies copy what you did, even though you [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=833.98s)]
*  gave a very clear model. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=841.22s)]
*  Timing on this. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=846.14s)]
*  Bill Gross was here with us today, but he spoke yesterday morning. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=848.02s)]
*  One of the talks he's given looking at the most successful companies and the companies [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=854.48s)]
*  that failed and was it their CEO, their capital and so forth, and his conclusion is timing. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=858.54s)]
*  And being too early is identical to being wrong. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=863.9s)]
*  It's worse. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=871.78s)]
*  Yeah, because you waste a lot of money. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=872.78s)]
*  And time. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=874.5799999999999s)]
*  And time. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=875.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's the worst. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=876.5799999999999s)]
*  So the company I did before Uber was like networking software. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=877.5799999999999s)]
*  I sold it to Akamai, but I was like, I was probably wrong and too early, which is like [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=883.38s)]
*  the really the worst. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=889.9s)]
*  So first four years, no salary. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=892.56s)]
*  I didn't have anything. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=894.8399999999999s)]
*  So I like to say, I actually at some point had socks that said blood, sweat and ramen. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=898.2399999999999s)]
*  So it will grind you to dust if you're early. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  And if you're early and wrong, that's intense. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  By the way, please make your questions. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=916.42s)]
*  We're going to be going to your questions in a little bit. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=919.76s)]
*  I really want you have a chance to ask Travis for his wisdom. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=921.24s)]
*  You hit a key point when the theme of this session is technological convergence, but [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=928.96s)]
*  the convergence on the smartphone and Google Maps and GPS and the 2008 recession. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=936.24s)]
*  How important was that recession for this? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=944.6s)]
*  For what? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=948.34s)]
*  For getting the gig economy, people willing to drive. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=949.34s)]
*  I don't think it had much to do with it. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=953.94s)]
*  The concept Uber tried before you. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=957.94s)]
*  What's this? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=960.6600000000001s)]
*  Did people try? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=961.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the main thing that existed before us was there were a couple taxi apps out there, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=962.6600000000001s)]
*  but the problem was it was just a broken model. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=970.7s)]
*  So a lot of times people, when they make, they see an opportunity, but they go after [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=972.6600000000001s)]
*  it the wrong way. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=977.14s)]
*  Taking a slice of the taxi market, A, is sort of very small. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=979.18s)]
*  And B, it's sort of like when Zynga built on Facebook. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=985.86s)]
*  It's like you're on somebody else's platform and they can squeeze you. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=993.58s)]
*  And you're basically getting yield optimization from like the 20% that doesn't matter. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=998.5s)]
*  So if a taxi guy agrees to go pick somebody up, but then gets a call that he doesn't [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1003.48s)]
*  have to pay any commission on, or somebody waving their hand, hailing them, you're done. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1007.36s)]
*  So the reliability, the quality of the product you're going to be able to offer sucks, which [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1012.78s)]
*  you could say is similar to where online delivery of food is right now. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  Like the restaurants are like the tap. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1022.04s)]
*  Uber Eats or DoorDash on a restaurant is like a taxi app. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1024.84s)]
*  You're getting yield optimization on a thing that's built for something else. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1030.52s)]
*  I remember my first Uber ride in San Francisco when you were just running the black car service. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1034.48s)]
*  And someone said, oh, I was going for a party. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1041.48s)]
*  Let me show you this new app. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1044.28s)]
*  And what's interesting was you didn't try and boil the ocean in the beginning. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1046.72s)]
*  You began really with the black car in San Francisco. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1052.18s)]
*  Can you talk about staging a moonshot, staging something that would scale? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1056.68s)]
*  Just that mindset of just let's get it working here right before we grow it. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1064.4s)]
*  Well look, we were in San Francisco for a year before we went to our second city. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1070.8400000000001s)]
*  Our second city was New York. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1074.1200000000001s)]
*  And we didn't even do the low cost products, what we call UberX. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1077.7s)]
*  We didn't do that till, was that, must have been early 2013. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1081.82s)]
*  Maybe mid 2012 was sort of halfway and then early 2013 was all the way. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1089.3s)]
*  So yeah, getting it right matters. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1098.3s)]
*  In my current company, there are a couple situations where we went too big, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1101.3s)]
*  too quick because you can learn the wrong lessons from the last thing. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1107.38s)]
*  I'm like, oh, this. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1113.42s)]
*  Scale is easy. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1115.0400000000002s)]
*  Works. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1115.7800000000002s)]
*  So I did this thing. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1116.2800000000002s)]
*  It was like, the acronym was PMD. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1117.18s)]
*  Basically, I didn't want to happen in my current company, what happened at Uber, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1122.5800000000002s)]
*  which was we invented this thing and then we had copycats everywhere in different [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1127.1000000000001s)]
*  countries and continents that we had to then go fight because they copy our thing [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1133.3s)]
*  before we got there. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1138.98s)]
*  Even though we went to so many countries so quickly, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1140.7s)]
*  we got there after the clones got there. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1143.54s)]
*  So we didn't want that to happen again. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1146.66s)]
*  So I came up with this acronym. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1148.66s)]
*  It was called PMD, parallel multi-continental deployment. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1150.3s)]
*  It sounds like a nuclear war. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1154.66s)]
*  And we did it. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1156.18s)]
*  But we went to some places we shouldn't have gone. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1159.22s)]
*  It just so happens you can't make money on kitchens in India, which is not possible. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1162.54s)]
*  We also found places that were amazing. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1168.5s)]
*  So we went to Kuwait. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1170.94s)]
*  We went to a lot of places you wouldn't go. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1172.6599999999999s)]
*  That ended up being, we went to Saudi. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1176.58s)]
*  We went to lots of places that we wouldn't have otherwise gone without that mentality. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1178.54s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1184.8999999999999s)]
*  Don't go to Indonesia. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1187.42s)]
*  Don't go to India. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1188.3799999999999s)]
*  Don't go to Colombia. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1189.3s)]
*  Those are the main ones. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1192.02s)]
*  I remember when France made Uber illegal. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1193.34s)]
*  That's my, don't start a tech company in a country that made Uber illegal was my motto. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1196.1s)]
*  How important is getting the system, the operation working really buttoned down before [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1205.78s)]
*  you start moving to additional new territories? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1211.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a balance. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1215.18s)]
*  I mean, there's a couple of issues that I have right now that are like, you know, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1217.54s)]
*  they talk about the moonshot inside the moonshot, you know, that there's things like that [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1221.06s)]
*  that make the overall thing win. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1224.8999999999999s)]
*  We've got a couple right now that are very much in that category. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1226.46s)]
*  That balance between when to when to cook it and when to when to scale it is a tricky one. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1230.7s)]
*  There's a there's a judgment and instinct, but you basically you don't want the overall effort [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1237.06s)]
*  of winning to get this is kind of maybe tautological and kind of obvious. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1243.78s)]
*  So I'm not sure it's going to be helpful, but you don't want the overall effort of winning [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1249.5s)]
*  to be dragged down because you went too big. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1253.7s)]
*  OK, obviously. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1258.3400000000001s)]
*  So so you're like, well, what does that mean? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1259.42s)]
*  So right now I have this one project where it's still operationally intensive because we [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1261.74s)]
*  haven't gotten the tech right yet. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1268.9s)]
*  And it's but it's growing. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1271.82s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1274.26s)]
*  We're like two six month periods in a row where we grew six x year over. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1277.1s)]
*  We grew six x in that six month period. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1281.6999999999998s)]
*  Now you're low base. OK, but it means it's 36 times bigger than it was a year ago. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1284.3799999999999s)]
*  It's not going to be small for long. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1289.58s)]
*  When do we push and start expanding? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1291.4599999999998s)]
*  And. But I know we'll drown if I don't get those core workflows tight. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1296.2199999999998s)]
*  We're going to drown in ops. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1304.06s)]
*  Yeah. So we're almost there. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1306.46s)]
*  We're right about to click in and sort of expand scaling something that's broken is not fun. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1309.26s)]
*  Yeah, I like to say let's not scale failure is what I say at the office. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1313.94s)]
*  When you're trying to do something disruptive, I mean, there's a massive immune reaction [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1318.82s)]
*  that occurs. Sometimes the immune reaction is when your own organization, if people if [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1322.94s)]
*  people have been doing something else all along. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1328.54s)]
*  And then sometimes, obviously, it's compares. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1332.06s)]
*  How do you deal with resistance that you had? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1334.62s)]
*  Just general resistance. Yeah. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1338.5s)]
*  I mean, I would like to say that. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1339.86s)]
*  That one of the most important things that innovators do is they are really good [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1343.82s)]
*  at finding valuable unknown truths, things that are true and very valuable [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1351.62s)]
*  that nobody else knows. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1359.22s)]
*  So if you create a machine that's finding valuable unknown truths, then you start to know [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1361.14s)]
*  a lot of things other people don't know. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1367.3000000000002s)]
*  And if you know a lot of things other people don't know, you can start doing things that [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1369.74s)]
*  other people can't do. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1373.22s)]
*  So that's called changemaking. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1377.1000000000001s)]
*  You start to be able to do stuff other people aren't doing, which means you're doing some [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1380.5800000000002s)]
*  stuff nobody's seen. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1384.3400000000001s)]
*  So you start doing a lot of it because you're really good at that core thing, which is [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1386.42s)]
*  finding valuable unknown truths. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1390.18s)]
*  You start doing a lot of it. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1393.1000000000001s)]
*  You're basically in the changemaking business. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1394.1000000000001s)]
*  And there is this thing in nature that is everywhere around us. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1397.6200000000001s)]
*  It's called resistance to change. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1400.94s)]
*  It's in nature. It's nature. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1403.26s)]
*  It's natural because nature abhors a monopoly and nature abhors change that can cause bad, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1404.7s)]
*  cause harm. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1412.14s)]
*  So it's a natural mechanism to slow down progress, to make sure it's the right kind of [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1413.26s)]
*  progress. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1419.02s)]
*  And so one of the best ways to deal with resistance to change is to build a massive amount of [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1422.3799999999999s)]
*  trust with those you're asking to change or that you're asking to bring along with that [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1428.94s)]
*  change. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1435.06s)]
*  And so then you really have to have a philosophy around how to build trust while changemaking [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1436.06s)]
*  because then you can turn your adversaries into advocates and you actually will end up [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1443.22s)]
*  moving much faster. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1448.66s)]
*  So a lot of times people learn again, learning the wrong lessons are like, oh man, the Uber [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1451.68s)]
*  thing just go crack some skulls and kick some ass, you know. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1455.74s)]
*  But actually the lesson to learn is different, which is if you're building, if you build [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1461.1000000000001s)]
*  trust as you make change, you can actually go even further. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1467.5s)]
*  When I knew you at Uber, we were talking about... [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1474.7s)]
*  That doesn't mean don't crack skulls. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1479.14s)]
*  I still got to do that too. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1480.54s)]
*  Just make sure. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1483.06s)]
*  It was about 13 years ago, I had my two kids, my two boys, and I remember at that moment [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1484.06s)]
*  in time, I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1490.02s)]
*  Without question, I wanted to see their kids, their grandkids and really, you know, during [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1494.3s)]
*  this extraordinary time where the space frontier and AI and crypto is all exploding, it was [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1499.82s)]
*  like the most exciting time ever to be alive. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1505.3s)]
*  And I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1508.46s)]
*  And I've done that in three key areas. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1511.84s)]
*  The first is going every year for a fountain upload. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1514.4399999999998s)]
*  Fountain is one of the most advanced diagnostics and therapeutics companies. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1519.54s)]
*  I go there, upload myself, digitize myself about 200 gigabytes of data that the AI system [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1522.6599999999999s)]
*  is able to look at to catch disease at inception. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1529.42s)]
*  Look for any cardiovascular, any cancer, neurodegenerative disease, any metabolic disease. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1533.9s)]
*  These things are all going on all the time and you can prevent them if you can find them [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1539.5400000000002s)]
*  at inception. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1544.38s)]
*  So super important. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1545.46s)]
*  So fountain is one of my keys. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1546.66s)]
*  I make it available to the CEOs of all my companies, my family members, because health [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1547.94s)]
*  is in you wealth. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1553.5400000000002s)]
*  But beyond that, we are a collection of 40 trillion human cells and about another 100 [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1555.62s)]
*  trillion bacterial cells, fungi, viri. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1561.5s)]
*  And we don't understand how that impacts us. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1564.82s)]
*  And so I use a company and a product called Viome. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1568.78s)]
*  And Viome has a technology called meta transcriptomics. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1572.8999999999999s)]
*  It was actually developed in New Mexico, the same place where the nuclear bomb was developed [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1576.7399999999998s)]
*  as a bio defense weapon. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1583.86s)]
*  And their technology is able to help you understand what's going on in your body to understand [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1585.62s)]
*  which bacteria are producing which proteins. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1592.5s)]
*  And as a consequence of that, what foods are your superfoods that are best for you to eat? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1595.1s)]
*  Or what food should you avoid? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1600.9399999999998s)]
*  What's going on in your oral microbiome? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1603.5s)]
*  So I use their testing to understand my foods, understand my medicines, understand my supplements, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1606.58s)]
*  and Viome really helps me understand from a biological and data standpoint what's best [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1613.62s)]
*  for me. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1619.1399999999999s)]
*  And then finally, feeling good, being intelligent, moving well is critical, but looking good. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1620.6999999999998s)]
*  When you look yourself in the mirror saying, I feel great about life is so important. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1625.8999999999999s)]
*  And so a product I use every day, twice a day is called OneSkin, developed by four incredible [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1631.82s)]
*  PhD women that found this 10 amino acid peptide that's able to zap senile cells in your skin [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1638.58s)]
*  and really help you stay youthful in your look and appearance. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1646.54s)]
*  So for me, these are three technologies I love and I use all the time. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1651.22s)]
*  I'll have my team link to those in the show notes down below. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1656.46s)]
*  Please check them out. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1660.4199999999998s)]
*  Anyway, hope you enjoyed that. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1661.4199999999998s)]
*  Now back to the episode. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1663.3799999999999s)]
*  We were in the midst of working on a Uber X-Prize for flying cars. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1664.78s)]
*  And that was part of your initiative as well as the autonomous car program at Uber. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1673.78s)]
*  Do you wish, do you think it was the right thing for those not to continue? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1680.98s)]
*  Or do you think they would have gotten the technology going faster? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1686.74s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1692.54s)]
*  I know it's retroactive. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1693.7s)]
*  No, it's OK. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1694.7s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1695.7s)]
*  Look, they killed the autonomous car project we had going on. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1696.7s)]
*  At the time, we're really only behind Waymo, but probably catching up and we're going to [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1703.78s)]
*  pass them in short order. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1707.58s)]
*  So my guess is there's probably some, you can look back 2020 and say maybe, you know, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1711.18s)]
*  I wasn't running the company when that happened, but you know, you could say, wish we had an [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1718.62s)]
*  autonomous ride sharing product right now. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1722.86s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1726.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think the same thing here. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1729.26s)]
*  I think it's, you know, there's still some lack of clarity on where flying cars or let's [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1733.8999999999999s)]
*  say at VTOL, like vertical takeoff and landing, like how does it exactly play out? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1739.06s)]
*  But it's pretty clear if you can get from here to there at 150 miles an hour, you know, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1744.3799999999999s)]
*  and it's kind of like a very fast commute. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1751.3s)]
*  I think it changes the game in a lot of ways. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1753.22s)]
*  And I think there are companies that are doing some interesting stuff. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1755.46s)]
*  I think Joby's probably one of the more interesting ones. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1757.9s)]
*  Yeah, Joby and Archer, a number of them. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1759.9s)]
*  I mean, it's packet switched humans where you're moving people through. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1761.86s)]
*  Sure. Well, this is what you just did, right? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1764.86s)]
*  That's network for the physical world. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1767.42s)]
*  You just went into Adam's base computer, right? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1769.58s)]
*  One last question before we go to your questions here. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1774.14s)]
*  So get them ready. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1776.74s)]
*  Iterating under pressure. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1778.3s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that you fabulously did was iterate the company, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1779.62s)]
*  the models, the products, the services and so forth. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1783.82s)]
*  You talk about how important iteration is. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1786.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's I guess that's like how important is breathing, you know, it's like. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1793.42s)]
*  So then it's really what how do you breathe really well? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1800.66s)]
*  What's your what's your mantra? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1804.18s)]
*  OK, so how do you? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1807.3s)]
*  But yeah, so so then it's like. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1808.42s)]
*  How hard did you push your teams to iterate? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1811.42s)]
*  Or were you the one, you know, sort of dividing the iteration? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1813.38s)]
*  No, I mean, yeah, the my company's my company's generally run in an empowered way. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1817.38s)]
*  With checkpoints, we would we like to say, let builders build, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1824.18s)]
*  but you need alignment and accountability in order to empower. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1828.5800000000002s)]
*  So iteration, you look, I know there's a lot to be said there. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1834.5400000000002s)]
*  I'm trying to think of some nice pithy things to say that. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1839.5800000000002s)]
*  I figured it out. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1843.3000000000002s)]
*  But but it's you've got it, you know, it's our three cultural values [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1845.66s)]
*  at my current company are truth, trust and passion. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1850.94s)]
*  So you you really again, you have to find those valuable unknown truths. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1854.66s)]
*  You have to have a passion to get it over the line fast and first. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1860.26s)]
*  And you have to build trust with those that you're bringing it to. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1867.02s)]
*  But I think one of the things about iteration is really lowering risk. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1871.18s)]
*  A lot of here's an interesting here's an interesting way to go with this [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1875.3799999999999s)]
*  is that a lot of people say, I want to have I want to be a risk taking company [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1878.74s)]
*  or I want to I want to go to I want to go work for a risk taking. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1882.5s)]
*  Initiative or whatever, and I'm like, no, I want to be a not risk [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1886.22s)]
*  taking company or a risk mitigating company. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1890.58s)]
*  I like to say is innovation. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1894.94s)]
*  I have this like fun formula. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1896.5s)]
*  Innovation equals big P divided by little R. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1898.14s)]
*  Big P is progress and little R is risk. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1904.3s)]
*  Risk comes in the form of time, money and reputation. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1907.5s)]
*  So I need to squeeze down risk. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1912.1s)]
*  If I get it to zero, then P then innovation goes to infinity [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1915.74s)]
*  and hold on to that progress while getting risk down. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1920.02s)]
*  And iteration is a big part of that. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1924.4199999999998s)]
*  It's about in some ways, finding those valuable unknown truths [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1926.1799999999998s)]
*  while minimizing the risk of doing so in the form of dollars, time and reputation. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1930.06s)]
*  As you go to the mics, I'm going to ask you a question. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1937.6599999999999s)]
*  As you go to the mics, I'm going to ask one more question. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1940.82s)]
*  And of course, we got questions coming up on Slido and on Zoom here. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1943.7s)]
*  You have really been passionate about a customer centric focus. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1947.74s)]
*  Yeah. Speak to that for a moment. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1953.82s)]
*  Well, look, I think, you know, look, who's the best of the best [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1957.4199999999998s)]
*  of the best at this is probably Amazon under Bezos. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1960.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that was that's just next level. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1964.7s)]
*  Just done so beautifully. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1967.86s)]
*  It's so clarifying to. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1969.38s)]
*  To make a person's happiness or a company's happiness, your target. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1972.7800000000002s)]
*  It's it's it's visceral. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1979.5400000000002s)]
*  And so if you start there and work your way through it, it gets you. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1982.1000000000001s)]
*  You just get clarity. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1986.3400000000001s)]
*  Now, a lot of people go, oh, I'm going to be customer obsessed. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1987.7800000000002s)]
*  I'm going to lower the price. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1990.94s)]
*  Well, if you don't exist in business next year because you went out of business. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1993.22s)]
*  You weren't customer obsessed. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=1999.5400000000002s)]
*  So customer obsessed means you you have to have a lot of heart for the customer. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2001.18s)]
*  You have to have a lot of love for them, but you also have to have a lot of ROI. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2006.0200000000002s)]
*  And if you get a lot of ROI with that heart, then you can put in even more heart. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2010.5800000000002s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things that it's sort of like that, the sort of the [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2015.46s)]
*  the feelings and the numbers coming together, if that makes sense. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2020.5800000000002s)]
*  And I think sometimes people forget that it's about both. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2025.2600000000002s)]
*  Simone. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2028.5s)]
*  This is not about technology. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2030.3799999999999s)]
*  It was about your mindset when you had so much trouble pushing the taxes [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2031.82s)]
*  indicates and every day, like it seems like you have another issue. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2036.4599999999998s)]
*  How did you keep resilient in your mind and your team? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2040.9399999999998s)]
*  And what's the mindset you can recommend to us that we always are seeing [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2044.78s)]
*  challenges every day and changes like you like you did? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2051.18s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because every once in a while I'll get an entrepreneur [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2055.86s)]
*  that comes to me and will say, when do I give up? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2059.1s)]
*  Like, when do I move on? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2062.5s)]
*  And I sort of formulated a three step program. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2065.02s)]
*  I'd love to know the answer. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2067.94s)]
*  OK, I've held on too long a few times. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2069.02s)]
*  I've never given up early, but I've held on to. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2071.6600000000003s)]
*  I have to. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2073.42s)]
*  This applies to well, I don't know if it applies to all areas of life, but it might. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2074.86s)]
*  I haven't thought about it. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2078.94s)]
*  OK, so step one, do you still believe? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2080.38s)]
*  Like if you don't believe. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2083.34s)]
*  Move on. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2085.58s)]
*  Yeah, obvious. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2086.1400000000003s)]
*  OK, step two, are you the right person to do it? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2086.94s)]
*  So this goes back to self-awareness and just knowing like, OK, what sport are we [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2094.26s)]
*  playing? Am I a support player? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2099.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm the main player. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2101.7000000000003s)]
*  Like, where do I land? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2102.6600000000003s)]
*  Where am I in this? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2103.82s)]
*  And super hyper transparent honesty with yourself about it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2104.94s)]
*  OK, so let's say we check that box to step three. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2109.38s)]
*  Am I about to do significant mental or physical damage to myself by continuing? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2113.54s)]
*  I remember one of my companies who was and that's the hardcore entrepreneur way. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2121.86s)]
*  That's like that's when you're really right on the edge. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2125.86s)]
*  I was running a launch company in the late 80s, way before SpaceX. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2128.58s)]
*  And in the last days, the company was like, OK, I'm going to do this. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2134.1400000000003s)]
*  In the last days, the company was making journal injuries saying the patients on [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2138.02s)]
*  life support four days left to live. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2141.94s)]
*  It's like just this emotional. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2144.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2146.06s)]
*  Richard, if you start having apocalyptic dreams or nightmares. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2146.94s)]
*  You're probably getting pretty close. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2153.7000000000003s)]
*  In my experience. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2157.06s)]
*  Richard, please. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2160.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2161.34s)]
*  Hi, Richard Metcalf. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2161.7400000000002s)]
*  The question is in my mind is the inner journey. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2164.38s)]
*  So you've led this industry disruption at scale. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2166.86s)]
*  And as it got bigger, were there moments where there's some kind of inner story [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2170.94s)]
*  fear or did you stop playing the big enough game or I'm just going to wondering [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2175.82s)]
*  what those kind of pivotal inner moments as a leader was or were? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2180.38s)]
*  I'm not sure I understand the question. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2187.42s)]
*  So you are leading change where there was no playbook. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2189.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2194.5800000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2195.1000000000004s)]
*  Where you were kind of out there at the forefront, kind of writing the rules as [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2195.46s)]
*  you go, a lot of pressure from various states. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2198.86s)]
*  So I'm just going to wondering like what that did for your own personal leadership. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2202.42s)]
*  Were there moments where you lost your nerve or never happened? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2205.94s)]
*  Never lost my nerve. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2212.38s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2213.62s)]
*  OK. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2214.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2215.2200000000003s)]
*  It's just the inner game. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2215.38s)]
*  Kind of what's the, the story of what goes on. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2216.18s)]
*  Look. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2219.06s)]
*  Yeah, there's, there's something to be said. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2221.86s)]
*  When, when I finished that company before Uber, that one where I did four years, no [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2224.3s)]
*  salary, like all this stuff ran out of money a couple of times, had apocalyptic [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2230.0600000000004s)]
*  nightmares, you know, this kind of thing. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2233.78s)]
*  I then would, I did a couple of talks, you know, like entrepreneur talks, things [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2236.5s)]
*  like this, and one of my sort of aphorisms was money will not buy you happiness, but [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2239.82s)]
*  it will pay for therapy. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2246.78s)]
*  So look, the, the clearer you are, the more centered you are, the more you can do. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2248.34s)]
*  We had one of our, our teams. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2259.42s)]
*  Over. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2260.7400000000002s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2262.02s)]
*  Hi, Travis. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2263.38s)]
*  How do you see cloud kitchens evolving in the near future? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2264.38s)]
*  What role will AI and automation play in its future growth? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2268.06s)]
*  And do you foresee cloud kitchens merging with any other AI company to become [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2272.62s)]
*  even more cutting edge? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2277.66s)]
*  Look, the high level of that question. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2279.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2282.54s)]
*  So look, I'll do the food part and then the AI, the AI part. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2282.78s)]
*  Um, the idea about cloud kitchens is, can you get a meal that is prepared and [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2286.94s)]
*  delivered to you so high quality and so cost efficient and so convenient that it [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2294.86s)]
*  is approaching the cost of you going to the grocery store. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2302.98s)]
*  And if you do that, you do to the kitchen, what Uber did to the car. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2309.46s)]
*  And you turn this thing that we all do for ourselves into a thing that [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2314.7400000000002s)]
*  a service does for you. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2317.78s)]
*  That doesn't mean we don't cook. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2319.46s)]
*  Like I like horses, but I don't ride a horse to work. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2321.42s)]
*  And really this kind of infrastructure will be so much more healthy. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2325.02s)]
*  I like to say you don't have to be wealthy to be healthy. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2329.34s)]
*  And that's one of those things we talk about. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2331.34s)]
*  You, you, you basically get again that you, what you get in return for this is [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2334.6200000000003s)]
*  you basically get your time back to do all the other things in life you love [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2342.02s)]
*  and cook when you want. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2346.78s)]
*  That's great. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2347.54s)]
*  But you don't have to. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2348.5s)]
*  And, uh, similar to what happened in the Uber situation is that of course, this [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2350.42s)]
*  used to drive, everybody used to drive themselves and more and more every year. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2355.82s)]
*  Uh, somebody else is doing it for us or there's a service that does it for us. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2359.9s)]
*  And ultimately an automated one as it relates to AI on this question. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2363.54s)]
*  I think everybody is very familiar with chat. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2367.7799999999997s)]
*  GPT deep seek, grok, this kind of thing. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2369.94s)]
*  I call that bits AI that's AI for bits. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2375.2599999999998s)]
*  There's a whole other thing that we're probably going to start seeing more of, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2380.58s)]
*  which is what I call Adam's AI AI around the physical world. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2384.94s)]
*  You could say the first iteration of that is what you see with, uh, the [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2389.7799999999997s)]
*  way most rolling around, right? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2393.7799999999997s)]
*  And autonomous cars generally, but what about humanoids? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2396.02s)]
*  What about it's basically how do, how does, and how does a machine move [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2398.58s)]
*  through the physical world and act in the physical world? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2404.06s)]
*  There is very, there's a whole other. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2408.34s)]
*  Set of models that are going to need to be invented to make that real. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2412.7s)]
*  Uh, sometimes borrowing from the other side, but it's a, it's a different ballgame. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2418.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2425.06s)]
*  Gustavo on zoom. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2425.7000000000003s)]
*  What's your question? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2427.1400000000003s)]
*  Gustavo. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2427.6600000000003s)]
*  Hi, hi, Travis. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2428.98s)]
*  Uh, I'm from Brazil. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2430.34s)]
*  I am a serial entrepreneur. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2431.98s)]
*  I have a $1 billion companies in my track record. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2433.86s)]
*  They co-founded in my experience. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2436.7400000000002s)]
*  Luck plays a bigger role than my vision and ability in your view. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2438.98s)]
*  Does luck significantly contribute to the success of a business? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2443.26s)]
*  Could you venture a percentage? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2447.42s)]
*  It's so important is luck, Travis. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2450.06s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2454.02s)]
*  So I like to play back in it. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2455.2200000000003s)]
*  Does anybody here like to play back in anybody? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2457.5s)]
*  All right, there we go. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2459.38s)]
*  In any given game, luck plays a real role. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2461.38s)]
*  But if you play a hundred games, it doesn't. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2466.06s)]
*  That's a really good analogy. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2469.86s)]
*  So the way to think about it is, is the success that you have, is it due [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2471.6200000000003s)]
*  to 10,000 decisions or is it due to two? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2476.54s)]
*  If it's due to just a couple, then you're lucky. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2482.2599999999998s)]
*  If it's due to 10,000, you're not. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2485.7799999999997s)]
*  Love that. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2489.22s)]
*  Cartique. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2489.7799999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2491.3s)]
*  Travis. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2491.98s)]
*  Thrilled to have you here. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2492.46s)]
*  Um, so my question actually, and I'm going to reference George's question up [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2493.38s)]
*  there, if you don't mind, um, is about what framework do you have and that [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2497.74s)]
*  you're deploying, deploying to determine to assess timing, but also [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2503.34s)]
*  valuable unknown truths? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2508.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2513.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, timing, you know, you get burned. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2513.3s)]
*  What, what, you know, a lot of the, the other question I get a lot of is how [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2515.98s)]
*  do you, is a, what'd you learn? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2518.7000000000003s)]
*  What did you learn at the last thing? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2520.46s)]
*  Or what did you learn? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2522.1400000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, well, I learned all the things I shouldn't do. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2523.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2526.38s)]
*  And that usually, I mean, a bit, all of that is about really seeing the future. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2528.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2534.58s)]
*  So a valuable unknown truth is means you see something nobody else does. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2534.82s)]
*  It means you believe something that is against what everybody else believes. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2538.86s)]
*  It means you have to see the future. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2543.06s)]
*  You have to see the difference between perception and reality where [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2544.78s)]
*  everybody thinks reality is here. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2549.46s)]
*  That's their perception. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2551.34s)]
*  They think reality is here, but it's actually over here. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2552.26s)]
*  The distance between the two is the innovators playground. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2555.38s)]
*  So you have to get good at seeing what the future really is and being very [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2559.38s)]
*  skeptical of everything coming in and analyzing in a very truthful way. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2564.18s)]
*  And getting good at it. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2571.18s)]
*  Uh, what is actual reality? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2572.46s)]
*  Not what do people think reality is and look for those moments when what people [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2575.14s)]
*  think is very, very different than what is real. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2581.86s)]
*  That's where all the good stuff is. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2584.9s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2587.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2589.38s)]
*  Keep it up to that. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2589.9s)]
*  John. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2592.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2595.1400000000003s)]
*  Hi, Travis. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2595.7000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2597.1800000000003s)]
*  I have a really important question. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2598.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2600.7000000000003s)]
*  How has your leadership changed since everything that happened at Uber? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2600.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2606.1800000000003s)]
*  Great question. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2607.34s)]
*  So before Uber, the largest company that I had run was a 12 person company. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2608.14s)]
*  So kind of everything. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2613.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2616.26s)]
*  So everything I'm saying right now is from a journey where you learn every day [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2616.7000000000003s)]
*  and you sort of deeply commit to getting better every day. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2625.42s)]
*  So like everything from 12 people running scrappy, don't know what the hell you're [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2630.54s)]
*  doing, you know, not paying yourself for four years. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2634.94s)]
*  How big was Uber at that point? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2638.3s)]
*  It's like 15, 20,000 people. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2639.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2641.58s)]
*  And then, you know, several million drivers. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2641.9s)]
*  It was a lot, you know, so what I learned is just like, like everything I'm saying, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2643.5s)]
*  you know, and you iterate on all those things as you go. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2649.1s)]
*  We'll go to Elchin. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2653.2200000000003s)]
*  Elchin. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2654.1s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2655.26s)]
*  What's your advice on, uh, industry that that's super segment segmented. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2656.42s)]
*  So I missed you. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2661.46s)]
*  What's my advice on what's your advice on the, on the, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2662.26s)]
*  on segmented industry, such as construction materials, uh, digitize the industry. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2664.8199999999997s)]
*  And I've been wrong for the last five years. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2673.1s)]
*  Look, I I've played around. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2677.8199999999997s)]
*  So, so we buy property and, and do construction. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2679.54s)]
*  That's part of what we do. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2682.74s)]
*  Um, and I've sort of dabbled in modular construction. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2684.14s)]
*  Then the promise of it is so beautiful. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2689.8599999999997s)]
*  Um, of course the issue is called local contractors and subcontractors. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2692.54s)]
*  And like we did this thing where we made this beautiful. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2701.9s)]
*  We would manufacture these facilities, these kitchen facilities offsite. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2704.06s)]
*  Just really epically, just, just wonderful. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2709.66s)]
*  But then it turns out like, okay, you have to put them together like Legos on site. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2712.5s)]
*  Um, but now I have to train a set of contractors to build it. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2717.26s)]
*  And in the first go, we had one that could do it. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2721.66s)]
*  And he wakes up one morning. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2725.5s)]
*  He's like, you know, I don't feel like doing it today. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2727.14s)]
*  And you're like, please, pretty please. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2732.42s)]
*  We signed a contract. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2733.66s)]
*  You're supposed to do it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2735.02s)]
*  And then he's like, you know, I think if you paid me half a million dollars more, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2736.2999999999997s)]
*  I would do so you get into this world where it's against the contract you sign, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2740.02s)]
*  but like they got you. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2745.98s)]
*  So then you're like, okay, now I have to train all these, all these contractors [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2747.78s)]
*  to do this thing so that I can manufacture somewhere else and then put the pieces [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2752.5s)]
*  together low. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2757.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, my point is, is like, there's a lot of change that needs to happen. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2758.34s)]
*  It may be that we only get there when we get into true robotic construction [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2763.3s)]
*  on site or I don't know. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2767.6600000000003s)]
*  I haven't solved this vertically integrate everything yet. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2771.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2774.0200000000004s)]
*  I don't have the answer for this one, but I have so much hope. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2774.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2777.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2778.46s)]
*  Jacob, one of our teens again. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2779.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2781.46s)]
*  Hello, Travis. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2781.94s)]
*  So do you believe that the mass disruption of currently existing industries happens [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2783.1400000000003s)]
*  based off of factors within or out of your control when you're creating a business [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2789.0600000000004s)]
*  based on your experiences at Uber? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2793.78s)]
*  Look, nobody's in control of the world. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2796.9s)]
*  So you have to see into where the world is going and build for that world. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2799.74s)]
*  And sometimes the world changes in ways that you didn't expect. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2809.66s)]
*  And you have to adapt to that. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2816.06s)]
*  So we're only in control of what we do each day, but most definitely most of [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2819.06s)]
*  what's going on, we're not in control of. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2825.2999999999997s)]
*  And I think that's a super important thing for people to realize, because I think a lot [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2827.22s)]
*  of people get really attached to this idea of controlling stuff and they get into weird [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2830.7s)]
*  spots when you do that. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2835.3799999999997s)]
*  Now there's the other side of it. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2837.42s)]
*  You get so used to not being in control. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2838.7799999999997s)]
*  Like as an entrepreneur, you wake up and you're like, what crazy F'ed up thing is [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2842.02s)]
*  happening today? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2845.8599999999997s)]
*  And you just go, yeah, I guess that's what's happening today. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2847.06s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2849.42s)]
*  But then you almost lose your spine. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2850.22s)]
*  You almost become an invertebrate because you're like, oh, I'm going to be [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2853.1s)]
*  like this blob that's just cool with whatever's happening. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2856.54s)]
*  So you have to sort of keep the fight to try to make the world the way you want it, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2859.9s)]
*  but you can't get attached to trying to control it. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2865.98s)]
*  It's like this balance. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2868.98s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2871.42s)]
*  Varun on Zoom, please. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2871.9s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2877.46s)]
*  Hi, Travis. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2878.3s)]
*  Dining in from Dubai. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2881.46s)]
*  My question is the global consulting industry is highly fragmented and as we live longer, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2882.86s)]
*  there's going to be a lot more people who work in the industry who will become [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2888.7000000000003s)]
*  consultants. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2893.7400000000002s)]
*  It's really fragmented and it's a large industry. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2894.54s)]
*  Is it a good idea to consolidate this industry using the Uber model? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2897.78s)]
*  Push a button, get a consultant. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2904.1400000000003s)]
*  I was just kidding. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2907.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2908.86s)]
*  I was just kidding. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2909.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2910.86s)]
*  I feel like, okay. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2911.9s)]
*  No, I think that the consulting world is so much about what can be done with AI. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2914.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2922.1400000000003s)]
*  I think consulting is about to get radically transformed with AI right now. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2922.34s)]
*  Like you're like, okay, if you're sort of a traditional consultant and you just, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2926.3s)]
*  you're doing the thing, you're executing the thing, you're probably in some big [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2930.7400000000002s)]
*  trouble. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2934.54s)]
*  If you are the consultant that puts the things together that replaces the [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2934.98s)]
*  consultant, maybe you've got some stuff, you know, and you're basically going to [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2939.9s)]
*  those, like I previously mentioned, profitable companies with competitive [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2944.86s)]
*  motes and like making their moat bigger and making their profit bigger is [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2948.58s)]
*  probably pretty interesting from a financial point of view. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2953.9s)]
*  I think consulting is a scarcity mindset business. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2957.7s)]
*  You build a wall around these consultants and you're like, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2961.06s)]
*  you know, you're building a wall around these consultants and you meter them out [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2963.86s)]
*  a little bit at a time and that will get completely disintermediated by AI. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2967.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2971.78s)]
*  Ted. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2973.1800000000003s)]
*  It's good. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2973.58s)]
*  You can push a button now and get a consultant. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2973.98s)]
*  It's called deep research. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2976.02s)]
*  We've been talking about it for the last two days. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2976.94s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2978.2200000000003s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2978.78s)]
*  Travis, what advice do you have please for investors and board members who want [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2979.3s)]
*  to make entrepreneurs like you successful or working with people like you? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2986.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2990.5s)]
*  What are the tailwinds? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2990.7000000000003s)]
*  That they create. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2992.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2994.06s)]
*  I mean, I'm going to say some provocative things. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2994.34s)]
*  I was hoping you would. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2996.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2997.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2997.62s)]
*  Let's, let's go. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2998.06s)]
*  I think there are a lot of investors who make the pitch of founder friendly. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=2998.86s)]
*  They make the pitch as if their job is to serve the founder, but that's not their job. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3005.66s)]
*  Their job is called capital allocation. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3013.78s)]
*  And once you make that leap that you understand that your job is capital [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3017.66s)]
*  allocation and not happiness of a founder, then I think a lot of things actually get [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3021.34s)]
*  into a much better spot. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3029.1400000000003s)]
*  And generally for, from a founder's perspective, the way a founder should look at an [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3031.46s)]
*  investor is not which investor is going to be founder friendly or help me. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3037.3s)]
*  You know, this kind of things. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3044.6600000000003s)]
*  I've just never seen that work. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3045.42s)]
*  Uh, it's, it's a, which investor does the least amount of harm? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3047.3799999999997s)]
*  So the way I look at it is, okay, you're playing a chess match. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3055.5s)]
*  You're like a grand master chess player, right? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3058.54s)]
*  And you're playing another grand master chess player and you're playing this game [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3061.14s)]
*  like 60 hours a week, this match 60 hours a week is what you're doing. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3065.7799999999997s)]
*  And you're like pretty exhausted from doing that, but like you're passionate about it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3070.18s)]
*  And then there's this chess enthusiast that doesn't actually play chess is trying [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3075.14s)]
*  to tell you what to do on the chess board. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3081.06s)]
*  And you're like, homie is it, let me tell you the 18 reasons why that's not a thing. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3084.02s)]
*  And it's not their fault. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3090.98s)]
*  They're not playing chess. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3092.18s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3093.54s)]
*  But, but the do no harm is a real thing. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3094.7s)]
*  I look governance matters. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3098.14s)]
*  Uh, but a lot of times I think investors get in the mode of thinking they're the idea guy. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3100.46s)]
*  It's if the investor is the idea guy, you have the wrong company. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3107.82s)]
*  And getting a board that supports you as a, as a moonshot entrepreneur that gives you [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3113.54s)]
*  the freedom to do riskier things. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3118.82s)]
*  It's gotta be smart risks. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3122.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3123.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3124.06s)]
*  Of course. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3124.34s)]
*  But still, yeah, like you still, as a board member should be like, are you smoking [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3124.6600000000003s)]
*  something, you know, the response should be very good, but you should be asking, are [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3129.18s)]
*  you smoking something? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3135.8999999999996s)]
*  Cause things can get weird. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3137.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3139.02s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3139.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3139.8599999999997s)]
*  This is such a wonderful conversation. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3141.7s)]
*  Um, so we were having dinner last night and it was a group of founders and we started [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3143.8199999999997s)]
*  to brainstorm around what's happening over the next five years and 10 years. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3148.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, robots and AI replace all of our jobs. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3153.58s)]
*  How do we prepare for that future? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3157.7400000000002s)]
*  I'd love to get your thoughts because it's coming up fast. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3159.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3163.94s)]
*  I mean, this is a hard one to answer because the history of technology basically says [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3164.1800000000003s)]
*  we're fine, but a lot of times history says you're fine and then things change, you [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3169.58s)]
*  know, so it's like, ah, I don't know. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3173.9s)]
*  The one thing we find out the one thing we got going for us, this is a weird one. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3176.3s)]
*  The one thing we got going for us is that robots don't have bank accounts yet. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3180.2200000000003s)]
*  We had a two hour session on crypto last night. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3185.14s)]
*  Easy, easy. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3188.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3188.8599999999997s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3189.1s)]
*  Let me just roll with this for a second. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3189.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3190.66s)]
*  Let's just assume robots don't have bank accounts. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3192.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3194.5s)]
*  Um, why does that matter? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3196.58s)]
*  Because if you're making something cheaper, it's cheaper for a human. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3198.74s)]
*  It means that they have more money than to spend on other things. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3204.8199999999997s)]
*  And when they spend it on something that's powered by AI, they're going to [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3209.06s)]
*  spend it on something that's powered by AI. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3214.1s)]
*  It doesn't go to a robot's bank account. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3216.74s)]
*  And when some founder makes a shit ton of money doing whatever, and they're [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3220.2599999999998s)]
*  going to spend that money, it doesn't go into a robot's bank account. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3225.7s)]
*  So, so I'm in a weird way. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3230.42s)]
*  I know this is a little bit, you know, sort of niche-y with the way I'm answering this. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3233.94s)]
*  I'm more optimistic than pessimistic. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3238.34s)]
*  That I'd put out there that I think it might be more generally applicable or [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3240.2599999999998s)]
*  make more sense to be honest is, um, I've done companies that have failed. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3244.58s)]
*  And the main thing when the company failed that I experienced or that I saw [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3252.3399999999997s)]
*  was that nobody wanted the thing that I made. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3258.58s)]
*  So if somebody wants to go and make a thing that doesn't make people's lives better, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3263.46s)]
*  they should count on failing. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3269.86s)]
*  And if you want it to succeed, you better be making somebody's life better. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3272.66s)]
*  And probably a lot of people's lives better if you want it to succeed. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3275.94s)]
*  Um, and so that's where things ultimately go is that the machines are serving [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3280.7400000000002s)]
*  are by its nature, its DNA are serving us. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3287.3s)]
*  Let's throw it out there. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3293.94s)]
*  Time for one last question. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3294.9s)]
*  Rochelle. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3296.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3297.06s)]
*  And Travis Uber changed my grandparents life. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3298.18s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3300.98s)]
*  My name is Rachel and I am an Ascend fellow and also a new founder. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3303.22s)]
*  I am building an AI driven company to revolutionize how we form, sustain and [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3307.7799999999997s)]
*  grow our most intimate relationships. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3313.8599999999997s)]
*  And the question I have for you is that Uber wasn't just a company. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3316.1s)]
*  It was an introduced entirely new market. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3320.42s)]
*  It was disruptive innovation. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3323.46s)]
*  So how did you balance needing to educate people on the market with building your [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3325.54s)]
*  product for finding your business model and scaling? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3332.42s)]
*  Well, you know, it's like, um, it's, you know, you hear about somebody's first [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3336.5s)]
*  experience with Uber and the fortunate part is, is the product itself is the education. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3342.18s)]
*  They're like sitting at a dinner table and you're like, check this out. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3349.86s)]
*  You know, uh, you're at a restaurant, you're like, it was naturally social. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3353.62s)]
*  A large percentage of the app installs were at restaurants, right? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3358.26s)]
*  A large percentage of the app installs were due to one person introducing the [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3363.38s)]
*  thing with a link. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3368.82s)]
*  Like I get a free ride when I give you a free ride, we call that give get. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3370.7400000000002s)]
*  It was like a third of all of our new users up till like 2015 or 16. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3375.7000000000003s)]
*  So the product itself was the education. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3380.8199999999997s)]
*  Um, you know, look, I think it's pretty weird that one citizen taking another [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3383.62s)]
*  citizen across town became somehow really controversial. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3391.4599999999996s)]
*  Uh, it's kind of weird that that was controversial, but it was. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3396.02s)]
*  So we had to sort of deal with the controversy as we went. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3399.7799999999997s)]
*  Maybe it gets back into that changemaking thing and trust or lack thereof. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3402.8199999999997s)]
*  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's give it up for Travis Milanox. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGHlZpSbMs&t=3406.58s)]
