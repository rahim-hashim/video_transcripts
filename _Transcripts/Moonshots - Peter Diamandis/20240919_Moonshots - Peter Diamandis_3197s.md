# How I am Reversing My Skins Aging With Peptides w/ Carolina Reis Oliveira | EP #120
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438)
*  What causes skin aging in general from a medical science perspective? What's going [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=0.0s)]
*  on? Skin aging is basically a degeneration of the skin tissue and it's caused by two [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=4.92s)]
*  processes. I was just blown away by the science and the technology of what you've [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=10.88s)]
*  been building and I started using it. It is one of the few products I've used [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=17.64s)]
*  consistently, you know, twice a day for four years. No, this one has this ability [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=22.84s)]
*  of decreasing up to 40% the load of senescent cells. That's amazing. What is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=27.12s)]
*  your skincare protocol? Yeah, luckily it's very simple. So... [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=33.6s)]
*  Everybody, Peter Diamandis here and welcome to Moonshots. Today I have a guest [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=39.72s)]
*  who I think about twice a day because I use her product twice a day every day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=44.8s)]
*  It's Dr. Carolina Riz-Oliveira. She's a co-founder and CEO of One Skin. She has a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=49.64s)]
*  background in stem cell biology, tissue engineering, immunology and she founded [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=55.88s)]
*  One Skin with four incredible women, all PhDs in this area, to combat age-related [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=60.68s)]
*  disease, particular of the largest organ in our body, our skin. And I love the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=67.16s)]
*  product. I use it twice a day. Full disclosure, I am an advisor to the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=73.88s)]
*  company and because I love it so much, super proud that One Skin is a sponsor [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=78.4s)]
*  of this podcast. We'll link to One Skin in the details down below, but let's jump [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=84.8s)]
*  in to a topic that I've had a lot of energy people, you know, saying your skin [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=91.2s)]
*  looks amazing. What are you doing? So let's talk about how I'm reversing the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=97.0s)]
*  age of my skin. Carolina, great to have you. Thank you so much, Peter. So great to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=101.44s)]
*  be here. Thanks for your support since we launched our product in 2020. So yeah, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=107.52s)]
*  excited to be back. Yeah, I know. I met you on one of our longevity platinum [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=114.08s)]
*  trips up in the Bay Area and I was just blown away by the science and the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=118.56s)]
*  technology of what you've been building and I started using it and I kid you not, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=124.16s)]
*  it is one of the few products I've used consistently, you know, twice a day for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=130.16s)]
*  four years. I remember when I was interviewing Larry Page at Google when [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=135.52s)]
*  he first joined the XPRIZE board back years ago, he said his objective with [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=140.14s)]
*  Google was to create a product that people use at least twice a day like [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  they use their toothbrush and if they got to that, that would be super [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=151.98s)]
*  successful. So I know you've gotten to that and I've turned God knows how many [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=155.54s)]
*  people on to One Skin. Why? Because I actually love the product. So where are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=159.42s)]
*  you today? Up in the Bay Area? Yeah, I'm in the Bay Area. Fantastic. Continue with [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  the research here. We have an office and a lab in San Francisco. How big is your [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=171.94s)]
*  team at this point? We are about 30 people. Yeah. Amazing and are your [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  PhD co-founding women still with you on the journey? Yeah, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=182.82s)]
*  Alessandra is my main co-founder that leads the science but yeah, Mariana and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=186.98s)]
*  Juliana, they were very important partners throughout this journey as well. We [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=192.66s)]
*  all complement our expertise in some ways. I come from the stem cell biology, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=198.5s)]
*  tissue engineering. Alessandra did her PhD in skin regeneration, Mariana [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  bioinformatics and Juliana, she's an expert also in stem cell biology. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=208.34s)]
*  An amazing team. I mean really blowing away. You know, people don't realize skin [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=215.54s)]
*  is the largest organ in your body. Obviously you know that and skincare is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=222.54s)]
*  a massive industry. I should have looked up the number beforehand. You know how [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  big it is in industry? It's over 200 billion and then when you focus more [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  on anti-aging, it's around 80 billion and it's supposed to grow to I believe 150 [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=235.7s)]
*  in 2032. So it's definitely growing in a fast pace. Yeah, when I think about, you [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  know, what do I want when I'm you know 120 or older? I want to think clearly, I [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=250.78s)]
*  want to have great mobility, I want to have great immunity and I want to look [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=255.66s)]
*  good. So it's cognition, you know, aesthetics, mobility, those are the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=261.62s)]
*  fundamental things. You look yourself in the mirror every day, you want to say, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=266.98s)]
*  oh you know, I'm doing okay and you feel good about that. So let's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=270.62s)]
*  jump into the first general question here which is what causes skin aging? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=274.94s)]
*  And what is skin aging? You know, in general from a medical science [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=280.82000000000005s)]
*  perspective, what's going on? Yeah, so skin aging is basically the generation of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  the skin tissue and it's caused by two processes. One is the internal aging, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=291.3s)]
*  that's the natural aging process. Our cells are, you know, constantly dividing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=297.06s)]
*  and they're accumulating mutations and there is this build-up of, you know, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=302.14000000000004s)]
*  inflammation in our body. The other process is the extrinsic aging, that's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=307.42s)]
*  basically all the environmental stressors that we are exposed on a daily [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=313.94s)]
*  basis. So primarily UV exposure but also pollution, obviously smoking and other [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  types of radiation. Both of these processes, they cause damage in our cells [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=326.54s)]
*  or directly in our DNA or proteins. They increase the production of free [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=333.54s)]
*  radicals and this all contributes to the accumulation of these old cells that we [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=339.54s)]
*  call the senescent cells or zombie cells. And the main problem of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=346.02000000000004s)]
*  these old cells or senescent cells is that they start secreting inflammation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=353.02000000000004s)]
*  And the inflammation that they secrete basically leads to a collagen breakdown, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  leads to dysregulation melanin synthesis and this consequently leads to sagging, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=362.46s)]
*  wrinkles, dark spots. So if we were going to simplify, we can say that senescent [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  cells accumulation is one of the main drivers of skin aging. There are several [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=377.62s)]
*  ways that we can lead to, you know, cellular senescence. And the interesting [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=382.97999999999996s)]
*  part is that when we are young, our body is able to recognize those senescent [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=389.64s)]
*  cells and clear them out of the way. So our immune system is supposed to do this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=394.68s)]
*  well but as we grow older and we accumulate more and more of those [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=399.64s)]
*  senescent cells, the inflammation becomes to a point that it overwhelms our [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=405.36s)]
*  immune system. Our immune system gets deficient and they accumulate and that's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=411.84s)]
*  when it leads to those dysfunctions that in the skin we see as signs of aging and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=416.4s)]
*  obviously is also associated with skin cancer but in other tissues in our body, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=422.96s)]
*  the accumulation of those cells is associated with several age-related [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=428.0s)]
*  diseases. So it could be heart diseases, brain diseases. So this is considered one [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  of the main hallmarks of aging because it's not, it happens, you know, throughout [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=438.84s)]
*  our body, our bodies and then that's why we are very interested in how we can [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=443.32000000000005s)]
*  decrease the amount of those zombie cells in our skin. Yeah, the way I [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  learned it, let me bounce this off you for feedback, is you know, for human [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=455.36s)]
*  cells at least, we typically have something called the Hayflick limit, which [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=462.24s)]
*  is the number of times a cell can divide and I think that is like 50 cell [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=466.44000000000005s)]
*  divisions and at the end of 50 cell divisions, cells should have the decency [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=471.14s)]
*  to die. You've done your job, you've divided, okay, now go away, but two other [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=479.09999999999997s)]
*  outcomes can occur. One, they can go immortal and become cancers, which is not [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  a good thing or the second thing like you said, they can become senile cells [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=490.94s)]
*  also known as zombie cells, Grouchy old man cells and as those cells are sitting [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=495.7s)]
*  there not dying, they're sort of like in this, again, zombie state and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=501.65999999999997s)]
*  they're just pumping out inflammatory molecules that are recruiting other [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=506.82s)]
*  cells around them and causing this inflammation and I think it's your [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=511.3s)]
*  innate, your natural killer cells, your innate immune system that's supposed to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=519.1s)]
*  find those. I know you know Dr. Bob Haruri, who's the CEO of Cellularity and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=523.54s)]
*  we've been talking about the idea of supplementing your NK cell population [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=530.14s)]
*  to help you with senescence and cancer and so forth, but I think the point you [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=536.62s)]
*  made is as we get older, there's a concept called immuno exhaustion, where [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=542.2199999999999s)]
*  your immune system is just getting exhausted, it's fighting against all [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=548.14s)]
*  these viruses, it's fighting against all the increasing senescent cells and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=551.2199999999999s)]
*  it can't catch up. So then you need to do something else. So alright, so [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=557.14s)]
*  let's talk about, let's dive into it, you developed a compound to find and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=565.8199999999999s)]
*  zap senescent cells. So when you're doing your doctoral work and you're [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=573.9s)]
*  laying down the foundation for one skin and the OS1 product, did you [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=580.18s)]
*  set out to focus on senescent cells or, yeah, talk to me about that. Yeah, no, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=588.5s)]
*  actually we started, well back in Brazil we were doing something else, we were [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=593.62s)]
*  growing human tissues derived from stem cells to replace animal testing. Very [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=599.3s)]
*  different, when that first endeavor didn't work out, but we got the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=604.74s)]
*  opportunity to move to the US and focus primarily on skin and at that point we [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=610.02s)]
*  decided to use our expertise to grow human skins in the lab and test any [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=616.1s)]
*  anti-aging product that were already in the market to measure if they could [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=622.42s)]
*  actually promote any age reversal effect. So because we are able to measure the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=627.54s)]
*  age of the skin by reading the epigenetic signature, we could determine [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=633.54s)]
*  if a skin is like 50 years old, we can test a given product and we can measure [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=639.9399999999999s)]
*  how many years that product would reduce, hopefully reduce the age of the skin. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=644.42s)]
*  What we found really fast is that most products that are there claiming to be [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=650.3399999999999s)]
*  anti-aging, most of them cannot decrease the age of the skin, some can accelerate [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=655.78s)]
*  the age of the skin and none of them were actually targeting what we believed to [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=663.22s)]
*  be one of the primary causes of aging. So we saw that the industry that's claiming [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=669.62s)]
*  to be anti-aging is completely outdated, they haven't evolved in their approach [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=675.7s)]
*  and because we were studying so much about aging and we were seeing a lot going on [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=681.14s)]
*  in the cellular programming, cellular senescence and different strategy to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=686.5s)]
*  target the fundamental mechanisms that are driving aging, we realized there was [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=691.7s)]
*  a better way to actually address this problem, to target aging at the source. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=697.62s)]
*  So at that point we decided to shift from being like a testing company to actually [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=703.0600000000001s)]
*  a company that would search for new molecules, more specifically peptides. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=708.4200000000001s)]
*  We were interested in peptides because it's already commonly used in cosmetics and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=715.22s)]
*  for those who don't know peptide is basically the building blocks of a protein, right? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=721.46s)]
*  If you think in that way it's like a small sequence of amino acids and for example [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=728.82s)]
*  insulin is a peptide and peptides can have this effect of entering the cell and act as a [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=735.0600000000001s)]
*  messenger so they can activate certain pathways or suppress others and we were looking for [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=742.82s)]
*  peptides that could selectively switch off senescence cells or decrease the burden of [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=750.18s)]
*  senescence cells. So we spent the first five years of one scheme just doing the research [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=757.9399999999999s)]
*  in order to find this peptide. Using the platform you had created for testing everybody else, right? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=765.38s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. First we developed this platform that one, we can replicate the skin age in the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=775.94s)]
*  lab so we can replicate a very young skin to a very old skin so we understand exactly what is changing [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=783.3000000000001s)]
*  in that process and we can measure the age of the skin. The second is that we use the cells [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=791.0600000000001s)]
*  derived from progeria donors so progeria is a rare and genetic disorder that children age really [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=799.54s)]
*  fast and they accumulate senescence cells really fast so we use cells derived from those donors to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=807.3s)]
*  screen peptides. So we tested over 900 peptides but initially we partnered with this university in [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=814.8199999999999s)]
*  Brazil. They were studying antimicrobial peptides and they had a library of 200 peptides. We decided [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=823.06s)]
*  to test them against these progeria cells and in that first round of screening we found four hits, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=831.14s)]
*  so basically four peptides that performed the better and then we used an algorithm that helped [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=838.02s)]
*  us to do permutations, so changing the sequence of the amino acids in a way that we could optimize [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  the efficiency and we generated another 700 peptides out of those four and we test again [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=852.26s)]
*  against the same progeria cells. That's when we found OS1 and OS1 has this ability of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=860.58s)]
*  decreasing up to 40 percent the load of senescence cells. That's amazing. Yeah. So we talked about [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=869.62s)]
*  peptides and again just to remind folks, amino acid is a basic building block and your DNA codes [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=876.9s)]
*  for basically proteins which are made up of a sequence of amino acids and those proteins can be [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=885.4599999999999s)]
*  hundreds or thousands, tens of thousands of amino acids long and they're assembled in your ribosomes [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=894.9s)]
*  but the signaling peptides are rather small, right? They're short sequence amino acids, so [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=902.1s)]
*  what size amino acids, how many, what size peptides, how many amino acids were the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=909.38s)]
*  range of them that you were testing? Yeah, the range was between 10 and 14 because also to be [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=914.26s)]
*  able to penetrate the skin there is a limit in the molecular weight. So OS1 is 10 amino acids, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=922.34s)]
*  so it's over a little bit over 1,000 daltons. So and because of the polarity and the confirmation [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=930.74s)]
*  of the peptide, we can guarantee the penetration of the peptide throughout the stradium corneum, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=938.1800000000001s)]
*  the skin barrier, but obviously if you get to a bigger peptide it becomes more challenging. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=946.02s)]
*  You need to use the sophisticated delivery system. So luckily OS1 is a size that we can [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=952.1800000000001s)]
*  apply topically and we can detect the penetration up to the dermal layer. That's the layer that [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=959.78s)]
*  contains the fibroblasts that produce collagen, gives the firmness and the structure of the skin. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=966.74s)]
*  So that's great, so 10 amino acids and I am curious, I never asked you this question, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=973.86s)]
*  were you able to patent that amino acid sequence as a aging product? Yeah, so we definitely [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=980.8199999999999s)]
*  we have a patent on the, there is a motif that we believe that it's important for this function [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=990.5799999999999s)]
*  and there are variations around this motif that we can patent. So we have a patent mainly focused [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=997.86s)]
*  on skin and senescence, but we even have been exploring for other applications as well as like [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1004.74s)]
*  metabolic disorders and inflammation because one of the main ways that the peptide works [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1012.82s)]
*  is like decreasing inflammation. So when we treat those progeria cells with the peptide, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1020.0200000000001s)]
*  we see that there is overall decrease in the secretion that the senescence cells are [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1026.3400000000001s)]
*  producing in terms of the inflammation and that really helps in many other conditions. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1033.3s)]
*  So let me ask you a question, so I use the OS1 product, I said that on my skin, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1041.46s)]
*  but I also have an OS1 body lotion and an eye lotion and then a sort of sunscreen and so forth. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1048.98s)]
*  When I'm using OS1 and okay, do my face in the morning and at night before I sleep and then I'm [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1060.02s)]
*  putting the OS1 body lotion on my arms and my legs, is it my imagination that it's going beyond [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1068.58s)]
*  just my skin? Is it giving me an overall senescent protection for other organs in my body? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1077.1399999999999s)]
*  Actually we have measured already the blood of individuals that have been using the product for [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1089.54s)]
*  many, many years and we couldn't detect the peptide in the blood, which is good because [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1097.54s)]
*  obviously this could have other implications, good or bad, that as a cosmetic company, as a [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1102.74s)]
*  skincare company, we shouldn't be there. But what we see is that by protecting your skin and [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1110.1s)]
*  strengthening your skin, indirectly you are decreasing the inflammation of your body because [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1118.8999999999999s)]
*  your skin is your largest organ and as it ages, accumulates damage and accumulates senescent cells [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1124.98s)]
*  and as the skin barrier weakens, there is an increase already in the inflammation that comes [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1132.3400000000001s)]
*  from our skin. And even low levels of inflammation coming from our skin can compromise our internal [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1138.3400000000001s)]
*  levels of inflammation. So that's an interesting, one of the interesting studies that we did was [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1145.7s)]
*  actually with the body lotion that we recruited elderly people from 60 to 85 years old. These are [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1151.62s)]
*  people that already have a very fragile skin and we collect blood at the baseline and they use the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1159.54s)]
*  body lotion and the face for three months and then we collect blood again. And we saw a decrease in [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1167.1399999999999s)]
*  some inflammatory cytokines just by treating the skin topically. So that's a very interesting [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1174.82s)]
*  concept that most people are not aware that obviously your skin is impacting our body [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1181.86s)]
*  internally but in a very important way. So a lot of those inflammatory cytokines, they are related [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1188.74s)]
*  to chronic diseases. So if it's elevated in your blood, you are more susceptible to develop [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1194.26s)]
*  a disease. So that's a very interesting point that the product helps. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1200.6599999999999s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's very [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1207.9399999999998s)]
*  important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you love. The company [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1211.86s)]
*  is called Fountain Life and it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1217.3s)]
*  of very talented physicians. You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1222.74s)]
*  body. We're all optimists. Until that day when you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1228.6599999999999s)]
*  in the emergency room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this but you have this stage [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1234.5s)]
*  three or four going on. And you know, it didn't start that morning. It probably was a problem [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1239.06s)]
*  that's been going on for some time but because we never look, we don't find out. So what we built [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1244.8999999999999s)]
*  at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. We have four across the U.S. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1251.6999999999998s)]
*  today and we're building 20 around the world. These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1257.3s)]
*  a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1264.02s)]
*  cancer test, a full executive blood workup. It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1270.82s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease at the very [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1277.46s)]
*  beginning when it's solvable. You're going to find out eventually. You might as well find out when [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1285.06s)]
*  you can take action. Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. We look around the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1290.4199999999998s)]
*  world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years to your life and we provide [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1295.22s)]
*  them to you at our centers. So if this is of interest to you, please go and check it out. Go [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1300.6599999999999s)]
*  to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. When Tony and I wrote our New York Times best seller Life Force, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1308.18s)]
*  we had 30,000 people reached out to us for Fountain Life memberships. If you go to [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1316.1000000000001s)]
*  fountainlife.com backslash Peter, we'll put you to the top of the list. Really it's something that is [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1321.22s)]
*  for me one of the most important things I offer my entire family, the CEOs of my companies, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1328.5800000000002s)]
*  my friends. It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. Go to [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1333.78s)]
*  fountainlife.com backslash Peter. It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1340.66s)]
*  of my listeners. All right, let's go back to our episode. Because you've got a platform for [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1346.02s)]
*  measurement, I mean you had, so first of all I think you said 40% reduction in senescent cells [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1350.18s)]
*  in the skin, which is huge. You had to have compared yourself to other skin creams out there. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1357.86s)]
*  How do you fare against the other? I just don't know the field. All I know is I love [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1368.8999999999999s)]
*  your product and it works for me. But so what are the other leading products? How do you compare [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1375.86s)]
*  to those? What can you say about that in your testing? Yeah, great question. So there are a few [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1382.42s)]
*  things that we learned as we're testing other products. There are some products that they claim [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1388.42s)]
*  to be anti-aging, but they are full of toxic ingredients that they can actually be causing [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1394.98s)]
*  more damage than good to your skin. So some of them when we apply on top of the skin in the lab [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1400.18s)]
*  and we look at the histology like a cross section of the skin, the cells are completely [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1406.82s)]
*  degenerating. The cells are dying. There is a lot of inflammation. So unfortunately some products [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1414.1s)]
*  are really causing more damage to our skin. Other products known to have like vitamin C [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1420.8999999999999s)]
*  or other ingredients like glycolic acid, they can be good for your skin. So some can [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1429.7s)]
*  promote like a light exfoliation or vitamin C can fight, can work as an antioxidant and fight [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1436.98s)]
*  free radicals, but they are not addressing senescent cells. Similarly, the main product [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1444.4199999999998s)]
*  that's used as an anti-aging is retinoic acid or tretinoin or retinols. This is known as a very [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1453.3799999999999s)]
*  effective ingredient basically in those cell turnover. So the retinoids, they bind to several [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1461.54s)]
*  receptors in our skin and causes this cell renewal. And for most people you're going to see your skin [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1468.74s)]
*  initially peeling off. So you are growing a newer, fresh skin. A lot of people can't tolerate, a lot [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1475.54s)]
*  of people become more sensitive because while you are renewing your skin, you're basically exposing [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1484.18s)]
*  your skin because the barrier is completely removed. But similar to the other ingredients, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1490.26s)]
*  it's not decreasing the load of senescent cells. So all of them, they can help in some way, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1496.66s)]
*  but you would still need a product like ours that is targeting senescent cells. Otherwise, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1504.82s)]
*  you're treating the symptoms and the driver is still there promoting, pumping that inflammation [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1512.66s)]
*  that it's accelerating aging. Is there any product you found that is competitive with what you do or [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1520.98s)]
*  do you feel like you're the number one product out there in terms of senescent cell reduction? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1527.0600000000002s)]
*  So far, as far as I know, we are the only ones that are completely focused on [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1534.98s)]
*  cellular senescence. There are other companies claiming that they focus on senescence, but I [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1542.5s)]
*  haven't seen any data. So I think because we've been studying this for like the past eight years, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1547.86s)]
*  it's very challenging to get to something as we got today. So first, you need to find [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1555.4599999999998s)]
*  an ingredient that is effective. And we have tested several common, I'd say, longevity molecules. So, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1562.1799999999998s)]
*  for example, metformin or rapamycin or NMN. And some of them work for reducing senescent cells, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1570.42s)]
*  but when it comes to the concentration that you need to deliver to the skin to be effective, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1580.3400000000001s)]
*  to the ability to penetrate the skin and the stability of those molecules over time, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1586.5800000000002s)]
*  different pHs. It's very tricky to check all of those boxes, but there is rapamycin cream [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1594.02s)]
*  out there and you need prescription. We tested rapamycin in our skin and what we saw is that [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1601.4599999999998s)]
*  if there is a very, there is a tight dose that the rapamycin works well, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1610.26s)]
*  if you increase a little bit, it's already causing a little bit of toxicity. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1617.78s)]
*  So one need to be careful when you're using a rapamycin cream because we know that it can be [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1622.02s)]
*  immunosuppressant and it can be toxic depending on the concentration. Is there any limit on [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1629.54s)]
*  once-a-day cream? I use it twice a day. Is there any value in using it three times a day? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1637.3799999999999s)]
*  Or does it still work if it's once a day? Help me understand that. Yeah, there is for the face product [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1643.06s)]
*  we optimize those like for twice a day. We haven't tested like three times or more a day because [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1651.3799999999999s)]
*  it's almost like people wouldn't be able to do that. Interesting, we have tried to increase the [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1660.4199999999998s)]
*  concentration of the peptide for the face cream, it didn't necessarily lead to a better result. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1670.5s)]
*  For the eye cream, which is a different formulation and one very interesting data that [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1677.6200000000001s)]
*  we have around the skin on the eyes is that if you measure the biological age just under or above [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1683.3000000000002s)]
*  your eyes, it's 20 to 30 years older than the skin around your temple or forehead. So because the [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1690.1000000000001s)]
*  skin is much thinner, it's moving all the time, accumulate more senescent cells, it's more delicate, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1697.94s)]
*  it's a different skin composition that requires a different product. So for that product, we used [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1705.22s)]
*  eyelid skins that we got in partnership with surgeons that we were doing blepharoplastic [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1714.18s)]
*  surgeries and we developed that specific formula to increase the collagen and decrease the senescence [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1721.38s)]
*  around the eye. So for that product, we increased the concentration of OS1 peptide and we saw an [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1729.8600000000001s)]
*  improvement in the results in collagen production and reduction in P16, that's one of the main [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1737.6200000000001s)]
*  markers of cellulose senescence. So some people what they do instead of using the face cream, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1744.9s)]
*  they use the eye in their whole face or their neck, whatever it's there they're most concerned about. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1751.22s)]
*  I think if you have a healthy skin, the face should be good for you, obviously for areas that [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1759.8600000000001s)]
*  you need a little bit more. And how does the body cream differ from the face cream? Yeah, the body [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1766.26s)]
*  cream also has different ingredients, so there are ingredients that are more hydrating that you [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1773.46s)]
*  couldn't necessarily use on your face because it could potentially clog some pores. So we have this [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1778.66s)]
*  ingredient derived from mushrooms that can hold water 400 times more than hyaluronic acid, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1785.54s)]
*  which is known as one of the main ingredients that can hydrate the skin. There is sulfurophane [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1795.54s)]
*  that's also known as a longevity molecule, it's present in broccoli, but it has a lot of antioxidants [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1802.58s)]
*  some people even use for like treating cancer and it has a lower concentration of the peptide, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1809.3s)]
*  again because your body is not as exposed as your face. We optimize for the skin of their body [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1815.62s)]
*  and one of the interesting things that we have seen with the body as well is that a lot of people [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1824.82s)]
*  they have you know they get this fragile skin and if people have conditions like diabetes, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1830.1s)]
*  they can have some wounds that won't heal. And by using the body lotion, we even got recently [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1836.58s)]
*  revealed that the people were able to close that wound, not applying on the open wound, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1845.54s)]
*  we never suggest that, but if you apply it around you're basically decreasing that inflammation and [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1850.82s)]
*  the skin is recovering that ability to to heal. So we have seen a lot of people reporting that kind [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1856.5s)]
*  of benefit which for us is it's really exciting to see. Carolina, are you continuing your underlying [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1864.98s)]
*  R&D to find other molecules that perform even better? Do you have a you know sort of and are [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1873.14s)]
*  you using AI in that search to look for that? Give me an understanding of where One Skin as a Company [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1879.6200000000001s)]
*  is going. Yeah, absolutely. We continue to test new molecules. Right now we believe that peptides [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1886.26s)]
*  are the main molecule that we can deliver to consumers in the near term. There are other [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1893.46s)]
*  technologies as you know cell reprogramming which still has a lot of challenge in terms of translation [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1901.22s)]
*  to consumers. So we continue to focus on peptides. And when you talk about cellular reprogramming, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1909.7s)]
*  you're talking about kind of the work that David Sinclair has done on epigenetic reprogramming and [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1915.06s)]
*  reversing the epigenome of those cells to a younger a younger state. Yeah, some people can [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1919.94s)]
*  do with CRISPR as well. You can use with like viral vectors and mRNAs. There are a few companies [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1926.3400000000001s)]
*  working on that. The translation to consumers mainly as you know skincare products is still [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1934.98s)]
*  challenging. So we are mainly focused on peptides and other molecules that can be delivered in the [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1941.7s)]
*  skin. But always looking how we can optimize again the reduction of senescent cells, how we [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1948.66s)]
*  can reduce more the biological age of the skin. Because with OS1 peptide we showed that we could [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1955.78s)]
*  decrease the biological age in 2.5 years in the lab. This was over a course of five days, obviously [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1962.9s)]
*  a very controlled experimental condition. We have been testing now in humans [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1971.38s)]
*  the biological age after using the products for 12 years. And we have found that we [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1979.54s)]
*  we could reduce 3.3 years after using the product for 12 months. We are repeating the study with [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1987.8600000000001s)]
*  a larger cohort. So we hope to see even like a higher decrease in the biological age. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=1994.4199999999998s)]
*  But right now that's what we have. But we want to obviously develop the next generation of our [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2002.58s)]
*  product. One of the things that we are also looking to is encapsulating the peptides so we can [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2008.1s)]
*  penetrate and can be delivered in a more sustainable way. So there are several technologies that we are [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2015.78s)]
*  using and we do collaborate with some companies that use AI to generate these molecules. So we [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2022.66s)]
*  do these partnerships and we use our platform for testing and validating. Love that. So let's talk [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2028.98s)]
*  about beyond OS1. So for example in the mornings I typically do 20 to 30 minutes of red light therapy. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2036.9s)]
*  What do you think of red light therapy? And the reasons for red light therapy in theory are [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2044.98s)]
*  reduced inflammation, increased skin health, increased mitochondrial something or other. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2054.02s)]
*  And I don't know the numbers there. So do you use red light therapy? Do you recommend it? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2059.38s)]
*  What do you think of it? Yeah, no I think it's a great tool. There are many studies showing that [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2064.98s)]
*  red light therapy will reduce free radicals, will basically increase the ability of the cells to [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2071.06s)]
*  fight those free radicals. So it does improve mitochondrial function, improve the overall [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2078.26s)]
*  cellular function. So in the end it reduces inflammation. So this is good for your face, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2085.06s)]
*  this is good for your overall body. So that's something that I think it's a great pairing with [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2091.46s)]
*  our products. Other things that I think you know there are obviously some laser treatments that you [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2098.02s)]
*  can do in office. There is exosomes, there is PRP. I think when it comes with lasers I'm usually [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2105.62s)]
*  a proponent of the lasers that don't disrupt too much like the epidermal layer because you still [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2116.66s)]
*  want to maintain your skin protected but you can stimulate the deeper layers of your skin that [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2124.02s)]
*  sometimes is harder to do with topical products. So there are some lasers that will cause small [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2130.18s)]
*  injuries on the derms and then we will activate the fibroblasts to basically produce more collagen. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2137.38s)]
*  And obviously you know exosomes and PRPs, there are a lot of products out there with exosomes. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2144.9s)]
*  I'm a little hesitant about them. That's where I was going to go next. I hear all these skin creams [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2151.06s)]
*  with exosomes in them and for those who don't know an exosome is sort of a little [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2156.74s)]
*  contained piece of cellular membrane that includes growth factors and signaling molecules and they're [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2165.38s)]
*  typically pumped out by stem cells. And so a lot of claims on exosomes. I've tried some [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2173.46s)]
*  skin creams there. I keep coming back to one skin but is there a promise in exosomes? Are [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2181.06s)]
*  you researching that? What do you think about it? Yeah we did a little bit of research and as you [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2187.2999999999997s)]
*  said the exosomes are vesicles that any cell can secret. So obviously if you get exosomes from an [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2194.18s)]
*  old cell you're going to get a lot of bad signals. If you get exosomes from stem cells you can have [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2200.66s)]
*  a lot of those growth factors and signaling molecules. The main challenge are a few ones. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2207.62s)]
*  So one is reproducibility. It's really hard to have the same content every time [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2215.7799999999997s)]
*  because obviously the cells they vary even if you try to keep them at the same condition [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2225.22s)]
*  they will not secrete the same thing every day. The second one is stability. So usually you need [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2231.3s)]
*  to keep them frozen because if you keep them at room temperature they will start to degrade. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2239.2200000000003s)]
*  Mainly you know peptides, small peptides. So that's one of the main challenges and some companies try [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2245.38s)]
*  to keep it like refrigerated but again measuring that stability over time I would say that's [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2253.0600000000004s)]
*  challenging. The third point is again the penetration if those molecules are actually [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2260.66s)]
*  penetrating. So if we're going to use exosomes ideally you are going to use from a frozen [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2266.5s)]
*  vial. You're going to do it and then you are going to use directly on your skin ideally doing some [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2275.7799999999997s)]

*  I want to talk about collagen a second because I heard this from I think it was Bob Hurie and I [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2404.18s)]
*  want to just double check this. So we have 28 collagen genes in the human genome and some of [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2411.2999999999997s)]
*  those are type 1 collagen you know that's in skin and tendons and so forth and type 2 which is [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2417.7s)]
*  cartilage and type 3 again and skin and blood and type 4 in other membranes. But one of the things I [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2424.42s)]
*  came to understanding is that one of the things that causes aging is as we grow older we begin [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2434.66s)]
*  to silence some of the collagen genes and so our skin is not producing the rich all of the collagen [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2441.94s)]
*  genes that makes a quote unquote babies behind you know I shouldn't even use that so soft right so [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2450.5s)]
*  and as we get old and wrinkly it's because we're not producing the proper amount of collagen [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2458.02s)]
*  molecules. Is that true? Do you understand that? Yeah there is data showing that after the age of [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2463.54s)]
*  25-30 years we lose every year and about one to 1.5 percentage our ability to replenish the collagen [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2472.18s)]
*  because collagen usually needs to be kind of recycled right. You break down and you're [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2482.58s)]
*  constantly building new collagen and with this aging process we lose that ability and it's primarily [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2488.3399999999997s)]
*  due to you know an increase of inflammation and epigenetic chains as you said that will silence some [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2496.1s)]
*  specific collagen genes. Do you supplement with collagen at all? Do you take collagen [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2503.46s)]
*  tablets or pills? I mean should we be doing that as well? Yeah there are some studies showing that [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2508.74s)]
*  it can help. It's not very conclusive yet so it's still a little bit controversial because when you [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2515.46s)]
*  supplement with collagen depending on the state of your body your body will recruit that collagen [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2523.22s)]
*  to whatever it needs most. If it needs more to your tendon to your carilige it's going to go there [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2530.58s)]
*  but if you are I'd say if you're a very you know you know good health it could be well distributed [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2536.3399999999997s)]
*  and it could go to your skin so there is no harm of supplementing with collagen and there is you [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2541.8599999999997s)]
*  know studies showing that's anti-inflammatory as well and it can help so because you're already [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2548.66s)]
*  supplying the building blocks of you know the the peptides that you need to build more collagen that [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2557.7799999999997s)]
*  can facilitate that can speed up your own production of collagen but again it's not super conclusive [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2564.02s)]
*  it's not bad so there is no harm of adding collagen to your diet. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2571.14s)]
*  Yeah so I live in LA in Santa Monica I'm looking out the window it's a bright blue sky. I you know [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2576.58s)]
*  I rarely am outside laying in the sun I mean a few times I may go and lie in the sun for 15-20 [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2584.5s)]
*  minutes if I'm just want to think about something and it's a beautiful day and I warm my skin and so [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2592.9s)]
*  on but I'm just typically walking around you know and I'm outside I don't know maybe a total of an [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2597.2999999999997s)]
*  hour in the day typically getting to my car or walking to get a cup of coffee or something like [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2605.54s)]
*  that maybe it's half an hour should I be thinking about a sunscreen all the time every day even if [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2609.54s)]
*  I'm not you know sunbathing? So there is a lot of discussion about that I'm I'm the you know the type [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2619.14s)]
*  of person that would wear sunscreen sunscreen every day I work by the window so I know that I'm [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2627.54s)]
*  gonna get a lot of sunlight OS1 is already protecting but if you can add an additional layer [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2634.18s)]
*  that again it's safe it's not gonna cause any damage to your skin I would add that if you are [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2641.94s)]
*  going outside in any case that you are gonna get sunburn that's like when you must wear sunscreen [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2651.3s)]
*  yeah so sunburn is obviously the main thing that we should avoid they can you know increase the [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2658.42s)]
*  chances of skin cancer that's when you're really causing redness inflammation so it's really clearly [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2665.3s)]
*  that's bad for you I like you know to protect as much as possible so I will use at least like a face [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2671.1400000000003s)]
*  SPF in our case we we select the mineral one the zinc one and the zinc one is the one that we use [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2682.1000000000004s)]
*  in our case we we select the mineral one the zinc oxide because it tends to be safer to any skin type [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2691.7s)]
*  some of the chemicals they can have some endocrine disruptors so there is a little bit of you know [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2700.4199999999996s)]
*  discussion there but obviously if you're out there if you only have one option and if you're going [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2707.2999999999997s)]
*  to get some burn I would use a chemical sunscreen as well but I would say on a daily basis it's a [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2714.1s)]
*  good habit to add sunscreen and a lot of people you know think about the vitamin d production and [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2720.98s)]
*  how this could impact if you are staying in the sun for a long period the sunscreen should not [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2727.54s)]
*  you know completely eliminate your ability to produce vitamin d so you still can get [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2735.38s)]
*  your vitamin d production wearing sunscreen assuming that you have some skin exposure [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2741.54s)]
*  obviously some people cover themselves so much that in that case it's a little more [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2748.18s)]
*  challenging but you can still get from your diet or supplements and so on so I'm a sunscreen proponent [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2753.14s)]
*  on the more the mineral side at the least yeah when I know that I'll be directly exposed even [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2760.02s)]
*  like by the window or driving we get a lot on our hands if you drive a lot that's one area that we [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2770.1s)]
*  forget and usually later on we're gonna see that really causes the damage that's an interesting [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2776.1s)]
*  point right I mean I feel my face is pretty good but adding a little sunscreen to my hands [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2782.42s)]
*  for sure that makes that makes sense so listen you are a ceo of a very tech forward [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2789.06s)]
*  skincare company you're a phd in this entire area you have [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2797.8599999999997s)]
*  focused your life's attention on it so I'm sure everyone wants to know what is your [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2805.46s)]
*  skincare protocol so talk us through in some detail what Carolina does for skincare [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2810.98s)]
*  from the time you wake up till the time you go to sleep yeah luckily it's very simple so [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2819.22s)]
*  uh in the morning because my skin is already clean from the day from the night before I just [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2824.5s)]
*  rinse my face I usually go to the gym it's still like you know early on and when I come back I [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2832.58s)]
*  shower and then I apply the face moisturizer apply the body lotion after shower apply the eye cream [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2840.8999999999996s)]
*  and the honestly I mostly apply the eye cream at night but and then I apply the sunscreen so [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2852.02s)]
*  morning is usually face body and the eye cream and the sunscreen and then at night I will wash my [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2858.42s)]
*  face with the cleanser because that's when you need to remove all the impurities all the you know [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2867.3s)]
*  pollution dirt really really important and you formulated a cleanser specifically for the product [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2873.06s)]
*  or any cleanser yeah so this cleanser is formulated to first like deeply cleanse your skin [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2879.06s)]
*  help the peptide to penetrate better so we have data showing that using the cleanser you more [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2887.86s)]
*  than double the penetration of the peptide also doesn't disrupt your skin microbiome doesn't dry [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2893.62s)]
*  out your skin so it's a very gentle cleanser some people like to double double cleanse like [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2900.66s)]
*  cleanse twice I don't do that and then at night they apply again the face moisturizer and the eye [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2907.62s)]
*  cream so pretty simple takes me less than five minutes but I think other things that you know [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2914.74s)]
*  helped me to improve my skin it was a lot of like really be more mindful of the other products that [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2923.46s)]
*  I was using mainly like makeup a lot of times makeup has a lot of like bad ingredients toxic [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2929.54s)]
*  ingredients so I did reduce a lot of the foundation and then right right now I really look for clean [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2937.54s)]
*  products or products that don't have toxic ingredients because you can try to nurture [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2944.7400000000002s)]
*  your skin and if you apply you know other things on top that are not good in the end that you are [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2949.7s)]
*  we're gonna cause some issues there other than skincare which is kind of very simple [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2955.06s)]
*  I obviously you know try to get good sleep drink a lot of water [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2962.58s)]
*  and how important is hydration to good skin it is very important obviously a lot of the plumpness [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2969.22s)]
*  of the skin this sample comes from the hydration and the hydration one is like the hyaluronic acid [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2976.02s)]
*  the other extra saline matrix that hold water inside but also your skin barrier how [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2983.7000000000003s)]
*  intact how strong is your skin barrier to not allow the water loss so in our clinical studies [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2991.62s)]
*  one of the main things that we measure is the skin barrier the ability of to retain moisture or to [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=2998.02s)]
*  prevent water loss and we always see improvement with any product that we develop in the skin barrier [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=3005.3s)]
*  so both you know intake of water but also delivering some ingredients that will help your skin to [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=3014.1800000000003s)]

*  sleep bad or if you drink alcohol your skin will be completely like affected by that yeah yep [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsO4fNU7438&t=3029.06s)]
