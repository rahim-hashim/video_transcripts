# Bitcoin vs. Stocks: What’s the Smarter Investment? (AMA) w/ Salim Ismail | EP #139
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo)
*  The numbers are insane. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=0.0s)]
*  Bitcoin compared to everything else over the last number of years, outperformance is off [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2.34s)]
*  the charts. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=8.58s)]
*  I think that's probably going to be the safest bet going forward. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=9.58s)]
*  And I would much rather put my money into Bitcoin than an aggregate fund today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Is it still safe to own the broad stock market through an index fund over the next 20 years, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=17.94s)]
*  considering all the disruption that's going to occur? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  The biotech industry was decimated over the last four years. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=26.7s)]
*  I think a lot of that's going to come back. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=30.46s)]
*  So index funds around small biotechs think will do well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=32.14s)]
*  Make your organization as adaptable as possible and that will give you future proofing and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=35.58s)]
*  staying power. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=41.82s)]
*  That was what was going to drive the future in a huge way. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=43.34s)]
*  How high will Bitcoin go in 2025? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  What are your predictions? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=48.26s)]
*  My guess is 300k by the end of the year. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=49.44s)]
*  Everybody, welcome to Moonshots, our special end of year episode in which I'm going to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=52.14s)]
*  be answering your questions. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=59.54s)]
*  We're doing an AMA myself and Salim Ismail in this special WTF Just Happened in Tech. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=60.94s)]
*  This segment is sponsored by three companies I use daily, Fountain, Viome and OneSkin. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  Fountain is my company that helps me avoid disease and helps me understand what's happening [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=74.22s)]
*  to me. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=78.68s)]
*  For an annual upload every year, to answer two questions, anything going on inside my [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=79.88000000000001s)]
*  body I need to know about and what's happening to me in the future that I can optimize myself. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=84.62s)]
*  Viome is built custom supplementations for a surprisingly affordable price. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  They measure my gut microbiome and deliver supplements that are custom made for my body, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=95.34s)]
*  my gut, my oral microbiome. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=100.56s)]
*  And OneSkin is how I keep my skin looking young. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=102.92000000000002s)]
*  I get a lot of compliments on my skin which constantly surprise me and I tell people it's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=105.76s)]
*  from my OneSkin product, an incredible technology for finding senile cells on my skin, zapping [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  them and keep me looking good, at least to myself in the mirror. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=117.2s)]
*  Everything is linked below. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=121.28s)]
*  Enjoy this episode. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  Your questions answered by Salim and myself. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  Alright Salim, we have a lot of really incredible questions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=127.04s)]
*  Some of these made me think and I'm excited about your thoughts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  The first one is from Zovarian. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=134.23999999999998s)]
*  It says if BMIs grant us unprecedented access to the human mind, how will this redefine [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=137.39999999999998s)]
*  our concept of privacy, agency, even what it means to be human? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=143.72s)]
*  And when he says BMIs he doesn't mean body mass index. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=148.6s)]
*  It's brain computer interface or brain machine interface. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  So what happens there? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=157.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=158.64s)]
*  You know, it's like I said in the last episode, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=159.64s)]
*  I think we're going to take increasingly more functions of the brain that we have dedicated [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  neurons towards, like our memory neurons are now outsourced to the smartphone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=166.67999999999998s)]
*  It's just going to free us up a lot more for the creative aspects of being more human. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  For the last couple of hundred years in work you got measured by how robotic you were, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=176.28s)]
*  how many widgets a thing you could do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=179.64s)]
*  And now the most valuable employees and colleagues you have are the ones that are the most human. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=181.76s)]
*  And they can learn the fastest. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=186.56s)]
*  I think we're going to, this is going to, if you allow it, if you turn on intimacy mode [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=188.56s)]
*  where someone else can know all of your thoughts, there's a level of intimacy that occurs that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=193.96s)]
*  is very rare today. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=200.8s)]
*  I think you're going to give AI access to everything because it will make your life [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  automatical. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  All right, so at B.E.S. asks, thoughts on Sailor and Microstrategy's Bitcoin Playbook. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  So at B.E.S., as I mentioned in a previous podcast, I just had dinner with Michael and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=216.08s)]
*  his playbook is amazing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=223.44000000000003s)]
*  We're going to do a podcast actually on how to implement his playbook, how to turn other [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=224.44s)]
*  companies on the Bitcoin standard. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  The performance of Microstrategy's is off the charts. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=233.36s)]
*  And Michael is one of the most brilliant people that I know. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=238.0s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=241.52s)]
*  He's divv- He's dove in deep. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=242.52s)]
*  All right, let me ask this one of you, my friend. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=245.08s)]
*  Are you concerned that quantum computers breaking encryption and hacking crypto wallets? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=248.4s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=253.0s)]
*  I'm not because as we get to quantum encryption break, quantum breaking encryption, we also [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  have quantum encryption standards that are emerging. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  And we'll just move to the standard, it's an arms race. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  What is under threat is all the decades of past stuff that's encrypted, that will be [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=267.92s)]
*  at more risk, but the time value of that is much lower. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, I've heard people say we've got about three years to start getting switching [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=275.12s)]
*  over, maybe, you know, in five years we need to be there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=281.6s)]
*  But just to remind folks, I'm not concerned about it breaking encryption on my Bitcoin [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=285.92s)]
*  wallets. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm concerned about breaking encryption on nuclear codes or on the entire banking industry. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=297.28s)]
*  Much bigger concern. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=298.28s)]
*  You know, your Bitcoin wallets, may they grow exponentially? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=299.28s)]
*  And peacefully. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=303.08s)]
*  And peacefully, not the major problem. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=304.08s)]
*  All right, at MouseboyScience says, will you in any way contribute to the Mars colonial [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=306.28s)]
*  missions starting in six years? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=312.52s)]
*  What would you, would you go yourself or provide resources for those who go on your behalf? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=315.24s)]
*  When will we see humans on Mars? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=321.0s)]
*  So great question. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=322.6s)]
*  When I was interviewing Elon last in October, I asked him, I said, Elon, when is Starship [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=324.24s)]
*  going to Mars? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=329.48s)]
*  And his answer was aggressively the next couple of years. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  So I think we're going to see, as soon as Starship is operating, it's going to be going [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=335.44s)]
*  to orbit around the Earth. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=340.88s)]
*  We'll see it landing on the moon with its landing legs and then we'll see it going to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=342.24s)]
*  Mars. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=345.64s)]
*  I mentioned in a previous episode in my predictions for 2025 that I think we're going to get a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=346.64s)]
*  clarion call from the Trump White House saying boots on Mars by 2030, reminiscent of JFK. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  But those boots are going to be an optimist robot. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  When would I go? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=359.92s)]
*  I'd like to go to the moon, actually. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=362.12s)]
*  That's my first priority. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=363.6s)]
*  Mars, sure. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=365.88000000000005s)]
*  After there's a nice chalet and jacuzzi waiting for me there. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=368.16s)]
*  I don't want to rough it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll rough it on the moon because it's close by. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  But on Mars, if I'm going to go for two or three years, I want to be able to enjoy myself. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  Some robots digging Martian soil and building first. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=380.44s)]
*  How about you? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=384.16s)]
*  Do you want to go to Mars? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=385.16s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't look so great over there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  I totally agree with you on the moon. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=389.36s)]
*  I would go there in a second. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=391.08s)]
*  I think Mars is for the next hundred years or so definitely a one-way ticket. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=392.12s)]
*  And I'd like to retain option. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=397.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=398.12s)]
*  No, I don't agree with that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=399.12s)]
*  I think it's a round trip. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=400.12s)]
*  No, no. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=401.12s)]
*  One-way ticket meaning you can get there. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=402.12s)]
*  It's going to be very hard to get back. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=403.12s)]
*  Well, the whole idea of Starship is that it's being fueled with methane and liquid oxygen. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=404.12s)]
*  Not from a physics perspective. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=410.08s)]
*  It's the human, it's the time lag, it's all of the human aspects of all of that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=411.08s)]
*  I think we'll send humanoid robots for a while and that'll be great. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=416.96s)]
*  I think it'll be a while before we send the first human beings and then it'll be even [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=421.24s)]

*  You know, what's interesting is Bezos and I, I've known Jeff since college. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=427.96s)]
*  When I saw him back after Amazon was started, I said, Jeff, what are you doing with this [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=433.8s)]
*  Amazon thing? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=438.72s)]
*  I thought you wanted to go to space. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=439.72s)]
*  He goes, I make my money in Amazon and I'll spend it in space. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=440.72s)]
*  And he's doing that now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  We're going to see New Glenn, their first orbital mission effort very shortly. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  Good luck, Jeff. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  But his vision is rather than going to Mars, let's build O'Neill colonies, large colonies [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=452.24s)]
*  that hold a million people, build out of asteroid materials that are rotating to give you one [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=458.76000000000005s)]
*  G and are in orbit around the sun, maybe co-orbiting with the earth. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=463.90000000000003s)]
*  And I would love to go and pioneer one of those, bring all my friends along and build [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=469.24s)]
*  one. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=474.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=475.36s)]
*  Next question is at Felsow. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=476.36s)]
*  How long until we can experience something like Oasis, Ready Player One? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=478.16s)]
*  I imagine AI has to come first for something like that to be possible. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=483.04s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=487.16s)]
*  I think we're almost there now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=488.68s)]
*  I mean, you take some of the virtual reality and augmented reality apps, it's kind of incredible. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=490.36s)]
*  If you look at the latest Grand Theft Auto, it's almost indistinguishable from real life. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=495.48s)]
*  And there's this point in time where resolution on a screen exceeds that of the human eye [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  and we're just about there now. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=506.24s)]
*  And that changes the game completely. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=508.52000000000004s)]
*  What's interesting about all of this is that virtual reality is much more disruptive than [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=511.32s)]
*  real reality. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=514.98s)]
*  And therefore you'll see some really fascinating things happen. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=517.0s)]
*  So gamifying it and going to Ready Player One scenario, I completely see that happening [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=519.4s)]
*  in the near short to medium term future. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=524.52s)]
*  I just finished some time with Alvin Graylin, who is one of the real visionaries. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=526.88s)]
*  He wrote a book called Our New Reality. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=531.2s)]
*  And talking about this, and it's really AI, like the question said, is fundamental to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=533.84s)]
*  have this happen. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=541.12s)]
*  And we're seeing, you know, Sora and new stability AI and a number of these being able to generate [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=542.68s)]
*  in real time scenes to create whatever you want. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=550.28s)]
*  And so I think we're there within two years that the hardware on your head has to catch [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  up. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  Do you own a Vision Pro? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=563.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=566.36s)]
*  I've tried it, but I don't own one yet. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=567.36s)]
*  I think for a while it's going to be used in very specific applications like surgery [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=568.64s)]
*  and fixing sensitive aircraft parts and things like that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=575.0s)]
*  I think we're a ways away from the profile of that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=579.4s)]
*  The meta glasses are really an amazing leap forward at a couple of levels. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's where we'll see things happen first. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=587.44s)]
*  But I think we're a year or two away from the hardware being anywhere near workable [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=589.48s)]
*  to the way we want it to. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=593.2s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=595.16s)]
*  You know, it's interesting because I own a Vision Pro and it's been sitting under my [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=596.16s)]
*  desk. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=601.04s)]
*  I've used it twice, which tells you something, right? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=602.04s)]
*  The software isn't there yet and the hardware is difficult to get on and off. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=604.8s)]
*  It should be something you put on and it's instantly you're there. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=610.28s)]
*  And you don't notice it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=614.04s)]
*  It needs to weigh under 50 grams, which you know, a pair of glasses. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=615.04s)]
*  Next question. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=620.04s)]
*  Who else besides Elon is working on brain computer interface and do you think anyone [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=621.04s)]
*  is going to enable Rick Kurzweil's predictions to come true? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=625.28s)]
*  So Ray's predictions. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  2033 mid 2030s high bandwidth BCI. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=630.8s)]
*  So you're able to basically communicate directly with the brain, think in Google, you know, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=634.88s)]
*  bypass the peripheral nervous system. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=642.88s)]
*  You know, I've got one answer to that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=647.0s)]
*  I mean, there are a number of incredible BCI companies. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  One of them in particular is going to be on stage at the Abundance Summit this year. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=652.24s)]
*  It's science. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=655.9599999999999s)]
*  Max Hodak, I mentioned him in our last podcast, is the CEO of that and they have a brand new [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=657.4000000000001s)]
*  technology that rather than like a thousand little microfibers, which Neuralink puts into [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=663.64s)]
*  the neocortex of the brain, we're talking about tens of millions the way they do it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to disclose how it you'll learn about it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=676.0s)]
*  It blew my mind when I saw this. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=678.36s)]
*  And I think we're going to be seeing a lot of companies coming into the BCI space. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=682.4s)]
*  So here's the question. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=687.6s)]
*  Would you get one? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=688.6s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=689.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think, you know, I think the whole brain modeling thing is incredibly hard to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=690.6s)]
*  do but interfacing with the brain is a much easier thing to do. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=696.8s)]
*  And it's important to note that we've got a long spectrum interfacing with the brain, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=700.88s)]
*  yoga, martial arts, prayer, meditation, then neuro-linguistic capabilities and neuro-linguistic [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=705.16s)]
*  programming, etc., etc., all the way to psychedelics. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=712.68s)]
*  But once you have technological interfaces, those accelerate at Moore's Law and now we [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=715.8s)]
*  can, it's like the comment about sleep, we still have no idea why we sleep but the more [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=721.3199999999999s)]
*  we can help it along, it's better. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=726.12s)]
*  And therefore we have lots of technologies that can help it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=727.92s)]
*  We don't need to know exactly how it works. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=730.66s)]
*  And so the brain will operate in the same way. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=732.8s)]
*  I think we'll interface it within really powerful ways. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=736.04s)]
*  We sleep per chance to dream. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=738.56s)]
*  All right, at Imagine Action 38 says, is it still safe to own the broad stock market through [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=740.4s)]
*  an index fund over the next 20 years, considering all the disruption that's going to occur? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=747.18s)]
*  Great question. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  How do you think about it? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=753.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it's very simple to what's going to happen and this is a plug for EXO where we've [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=754.9599999999999s)]
*  done an analysis that showed that the more flexible and adaptable an organization is, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=760.64s)]
*  this is a study we did on the Fortune 100, delivery is 40 times the shareholder returns [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=765.5400000000001s)]
*  over a seven-year period than those that were least flexible, least agile. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=771.76s)]
*  So therefore the name of the game in a volatile future is make your organization as adaptable [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=776.7s)]
*  as possible and that will give you future-proofing and staying power. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=781.36s)]
*  That was what was going to drive the future in a huge way. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=787.02s)]
*  I'll give two data points. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=790.24s)]
*  I have a friend of mine who is a billionaire in Silicon Valley and when Trump took the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=791.24s)]
*  White House, he basically took a bunch of money and dropped it into index funds and [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=798.12s)]
*  basically said, we're going to have a roaring 20s and I'm getting invested in QQQ and a [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  few others. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=810.4s)]
*  I mean, the biotech industry was decimated over the last four years and I think a lot [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=811.4s)]
*  of that's going to come back. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=818.02s)]
*  So index funds around small biotechs, I think will do well. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=819.02s)]
*  But one of the questions is, do you put it all into Bitcoin? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=823.06s)]
*  I mean, the numbers are insane. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=826.86s)]
*  If you compare Bitcoin compared to everything else over the last number of years, outperformance [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=830.46s)]
*  is off the charts. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=838.1s)]
*  I think that's probably going to be the safest bet going forward and I would much rather [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=840.1999999999999s)]
*  put my money into Bitcoin than an aggregate fund today. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=845.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know where Bitcoin is at this very moment. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=848.5s)]
*  107? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=852.98s)]
*  As we're speaking here, Bitcoin is at 106.5. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=853.98s)]
*  So I mean, listen, it's going to be up and down, up and down, but your prediction for [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=858.66s)]
*  2025 was Bitcoin at 300. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=862.62s)]
*  I think that is very possible and it's due to a lot of factors, including everybody beginning [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=866.72s)]
*  to think about, do we replicate what Michael's done, Michael Saylor? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=874.4s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are going to follow his lead. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=879.48s)]
*  By far you'll get multiple entries in that, therefore it'll just expand the scope of that [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=881.94s)]
*  whole domain of using the bond market to augment, et cetera. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=886.28s)]
*  So I think there's a huge future in this. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=889.8s)]
*  Here is a great question from Nithi Ashree, G, who says, imagine that you're 23 right [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=893.0s)]
*  now. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=900.72s)]
*  Actually, I think I'm 23 right now. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=901.72s)]
*  Actually, in my mind, I'm 28 right now. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=902.78s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=906.4200000000001s)]
*  Would you build planetary resources? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=907.4200000000001s)]
*  What would you read and learn? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=910.5s)]
*  Where would you put your time and money? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=912.6600000000001s)]
*  Where would you travel? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=914.94s)]
*  What tech will you absolutely master? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=915.94s)]
*  What will you question about? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=920.62s)]
*  So a lot of great questions. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=922.22s)]
*  You could take an entire episode to discuss just that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=923.98s)]
*  But you're 23 right now, Saleem, what would you be doing? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=926.82s)]
*  If I was myself telling my 23-year-old and me what to do, pun intended, I would say go [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=930.1s)]
*  study philosophy a lot more and go learn the liberal arts a lot more because it gives you [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=936.46s)]
*  different frames for thinking about the world, which I think are very powerful. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=941.9200000000001s)]
*  A little secret about Silicon Valley is more than half the CEOs are liberal arts background, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=945.8000000000001s)]
*  which is kind of an amazing thing to comment on. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=951.2s)]
*  So if I were 23 right now, I would be diving deep into AI or biotech. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=954.48s)]
*  I think these are the two industries that are defining the next decade. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=961.72s)]
*  They're both massive trillion-dollar opportunities. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=966.32s)]
*  So I would get absolutely clear about my purpose in life, my purpose and passion. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=970.36s)]
*  MTP. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=974.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=975.44s)]
*  And by the way, if you don't know what your massive transformative purpose is, my team [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=976.44s)]
*  and I have built a platform called mypurposefinder.ai. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=981.0s)]
*  It's free and it will walk you through a process. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=988.08s)]
*  It's really, really easy and walk you through the process of defining your massive transformative [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=992.76s)]
*  purpose. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=998.6s)]
*  So find out your MTP and if it's related to AI or health and longevity, those are two [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=999.6s)]
*  incredible exponential growth curves ahead of us. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1007.4s)]
*  Would I go and do planetary resources again? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1012.0s)]
*  Yeah, I still want to go do it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1014.1999999999999s)]
*  But I need to go and do it when I've got a few hundred million dollars of cash in my [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1016.4s)]
*  pocket so I'm not going to raise the money from anybody else because it's just too painful [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1020.84s)]
*  to build these companies that are so cash dependent. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1025.2s)]
*  Okay, next question comes from Alex Lubarski. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1029.44s)]
*  If you could design a system of health care in the US focused on youthful longevity, what [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1036.12s)]
*  would be the most important aspect? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1041.0s)]
*  Alexi, I think the most important aspect right now is reinventing the food system. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1044.4799999999998s)]
*  I think I'm all 1000% on board with RFKs make America healthy again. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1053.56s)]
*  We're killing ourselves by virtue of the stuff we're ingesting. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1062.32s)]
*  So first do no harm. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1066.72s)]
*  So let's get our health system in order. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1069.2s)]
*  The second thing I would be doing is actually creating a set of sensors and AI models that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1072.08s)]
*  are monitoring us 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1079.2s)]
*  So I've got my arm, I've got my continuous glucose monitor, I've got my aura ring, my [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1081.8s)]
*  Apple watch. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1086.2s)]
*  there will be a suite of sensors that you wear on your body, in your body, in your car, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1088.2s)]
*  in your bed that's dribbling data to your AI and able to find and accurately predict [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1094.4s)]
*  what's going to happen to you and just doing that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1101.76s)]
*  And then it's about getting people to realize the power they have on sleep and exercise [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1106.6000000000001s)]
*  and mindset. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1111.52s)]
*  Do you want to add anything to that, Salim? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1112.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think two things. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1114.56s)]
*  One is there's a massive amount of regulatory capture in the healthcare industry and you [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1116.08s)]
*  want to break through that. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1121.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think that's the most promising aspect of the incoming administration is the opportunity [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1122.36s)]
*  and frankly the obligation to do that because that's holding back the health of Americans [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1126.48s)]
*  in a huge way. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  I think that's one. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1134.3999999999999s)]
*  And the second thing is a faster path to market for breakthrough in new therapies and diagnostics. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1135.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1140.48s)]
*  Right now it takes seven years to get through the FDA and by the time your drug is approved, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1141.48s)]
*  it's out of date. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1145.88s)]
*  So there's so much more. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1147.2800000000002s)]
*  And by the way, just to plug here, Peter, for those who have not watched your interview [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1148.8000000000002s)]
*  with Jack Hittery, absolutely drop everything and go watch that interview that Peter did [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1152.8000000000002s)]
*  with Jack a couple of weeks ago. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable to see what's happening and what's possible now with quantum sensors [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1159.48s)]
*  and quantum computing coming in line. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1164.3400000000001s)]
*  The opportunity for transforming healthcare is absolutely there and we need to take full [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1166.72s)]
*  advantage of it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1172.16s)]
*  Well, it's what you teach inside of OpenEXO. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1173.16s)]
*  I mean, there's so much disruption that is there, especially in the highly regulated. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1175.2s)]
*  And I think you nailed the head, nailed the whatever. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1180.0400000000002s)]
*  The nail on the head. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1185.16s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1186.16s)]
*  On the regulatory reform that's required. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1188.48s)]
*  It's just, and people are, the wealthiest people I know are leaving the country to get [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1191.52s)]
*  advanced healthcare elsewhere. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1196.72s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1198.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, crazy. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1200.3200000000002s)]
*  All right, next question. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1201.3200000000002s)]
*  Did you see the recent study done on the ability of AI to diagnose better than humans [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1203.12s)]
*  or better than humans plus AI? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1208.08s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1210.28s)]
*  Did you see that one? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1211.28s)]
*  Well, this has been in different domains, has been around for a while now, right? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1212.6399999999999s)]
*  But let me give you the numbers. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1216.9599999999998s)]
*  So it's approximate numbers, but like a physician by themselves with a set of data can diagnose [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1218.32s)]
*  at like 70% accuracy. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1226.12s)]
*  Yeah, 30% wrong. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1227.7199999999998s)]
*  A physician with a chatbot by their side can get it up to 75%, but an AI on its own [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1228.96s)]
*  is like at 90%. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1236.32s)]
*  And like, why? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1237.32s)]
*  Well, you know, the physician is biased. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1238.32s)]
*  You're injecting all the wrong information. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1240.68s)]
*  And it's like insane how, anyway, I'm gonna stop my rant there. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1243.16s)]
*  Yeah, so just like human beings should not be driving cars because we're terrible control [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1249.0s)]
*  systems for two-ton cars going high speed. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1254.16s)]
*  Human beings should not be doctors. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1257.88s)]
*  The legacy seven years it takes. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1259.88s)]
*  Don't tell my nieces that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1262.0800000000002s)]
*  I know, but look, you spend seven years earlier in your career becoming a doctor and then [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1263.0800000000002s)]
*  you never refresh, right? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1268.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's just absurd given the amount of pace of change. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1270.7800000000002s)]
*  They do have continuing medical education, CME credits and so forth, but the field... [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1272.88s)]
*  So today's a special day. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  My sister Marcel just passed her functional medicine exam. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1279.38s)]
*  And so functional medicine is a branch of medicine, which is root cause looking at on [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1286.04s)]
*  a cellular level what's going on. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1291.2s)]
*  And it's so much more advanced than what you're learning in medical school. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1293.48s)]
*  So she went back and spent a year basically retraining in this. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1297.68s)]
*  But even then, you're right, an AI in functional medicine is gonna just be that much better. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1303.28s)]
*  I remember Daniel Kraft making this comment that until very recently, in seven years of [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1308.76s)]
*  medical training, you only got one hour of genomics. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1313.72s)]
*  That's just ridiculous. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1317.3600000000001s)]
*  And why? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1318.3600000000001s)]
*  Because you can update the education system in an easy way. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1319.3600000000001s)]
*  You talk about immune systems, education, health care, the worst that there are out [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1323.64s)]
*  there. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1327.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1328.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1329.48s)]
*  At math gov says, how do we overcome exponential tech being used to wage future wars? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1330.48s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1338.28s)]
*  You first, buddy. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1339.72s)]
*  Well, the good news is this is an arms race that we've seen before, where bad people will [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1340.72s)]
*  use AI unfiltered, unrestricted with regulatory ethical concerns. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1345.8s)]
*  It makes it actually easier to spot and then you can police the big one. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1351.72s)]
*  Quick anecdote here. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1355.84s)]
*  Please. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1356.84s)]
*  Mark Goodman, who wrote Future Crimes, 2015 Amazon Business Book of the Year, tells this [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1357.84s)]
*  great story. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1361.92s)]
*  There was a bank robbery somewhere in the Midwest. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1362.92s)]
*  And the bank manager calls the police and says they were all dressed as construction [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1365.3600000000001s)]
*  workers and they robbed the bank. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1369.64s)]
*  So police are like, oh, this should be pretty easy to spot. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1370.96s)]
*  Except what the bank robbers had done and had put an ad on Craigslist saying anybody [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1374.3200000000002s)]
*  who wants a high paying construction job, show up with all your gear at nine o'clock [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1378.0s)]
*  at this location. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1381.8000000000002s)]
*  And so there were 800 construction workers in this square. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1382.8000000000002s)]
*  And so they essentially crowdsourced their escape and melted into the crowd. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1387.2s)]
*  The creativity that comes from that element is so amazing that you don't want to lose [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1391.8000000000002s)]
*  that. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1396.68s)]
*  Can you guide it in more constructive ways? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1397.68s)]
*  So I think what happens is as we figure out the techniques used by the bad guys, we fix [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1399.4s)]
*  it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1404.36s)]
*  Years ago, we were totally thought that spam would take out all email or that the phishing [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1405.36s)]
*  would make the Internet ungovernable. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1410.56s)]
*  And we've managed to solve those pretty quickly. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1412.24s)]
*  So I think the same thing will happen as we have bad actors and the latest technologies. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1414.16s)]
*  So the question really is exponential tech like drones and humanoid robots and humanoid [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1419.48s)]
*  robots with guns or AI powered tanks waging future wars. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1425.8799999999999s)]
*  My bigger concern would be biotech, because some people design a virus that could say [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1432.3999999999999s)]
*  to that virus, go find all middle aged brown guys with a Norwegian sweater and attack. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1438.9199999999998s)]
*  And that would be a bad outcome. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1445.9199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1446.9199999999998s)]
*  And so how do you deal with that is not a non-trivial thing. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1447.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, you've got your attack dog in the background there. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1450.24s)]
*  I knew the dog was trying to protect me from the back. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1453.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, not that that dog could do anything to protect anybody, but still. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1455.92s)]
*  It's a yapper. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1460.16s)]
*  So it was, you know, Star Trek was such an incredible TV show that explored so much. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1461.64s)]
*  And one of the things that, you know, has the potential for exponential tech is to take [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1469.68s)]
*  humans out of the loop. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1474.4s)]
*  So it's like robots fighting robots or drones fighting drones. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1476.0800000000002s)]
*  There was an episode of Star Trek, I don't know if you remember it, it was like it was [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1481.04s)]
*  called like the forever war or something like that, where Kirk and Spock beam into the planet [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1484.7199999999998s)]
*  and they find a society there where there are two societies that have been basically [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1489.4799999999998s)]
*  at war for like thousands of years because they did it in an AI simulation where they [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1495.12s)]
*  were like in the simulation and they they would say, OK, in the city precinct, 100 people [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1502.76s)]
*  died here. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1510.96s)]
*  So go in you 100 people have to go into this booth where you'll get vaporized. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1511.6000000000001s)]
*  And so they had a war going on that didn't destroy the environment, didn't destroy [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1516.68s)]
*  buildings, and it just very neatly executed people. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1523.3600000000001s)]
*  And then Kirk gets there and goes, listen, if your war isn't bloody, you're never going [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1528.3999999999999s)]
*  to end it. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1532.9199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1533.9199999999998s)]
*  So so then he destroys that system and says, if you want to have a war, like have a real [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1534.28s)]
*  war. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1539.28s)]
*  I love Star Trek for having explored all these areas. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1540.28s)]
*  So that's a question. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1542.6399999999999s)]
*  Shout out to the underlying framing of Star Trek, which was I.D.I.C. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1544.56s)]
*  Infinite diversity and infinite creativity. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1548.7199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1551.56s)]
*  I think that, you know, we are seeing that already. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1552.8s)]
*  Let's note that the Russia Ukraine conflict is being prosecuted by something like half [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1554.88s)]
*  a million drones more than people. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1560.3200000000002s)]
*  And the number of people killed by war is that it's an all time high, an all time low [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1563.5200000000002s)]
*  in human history. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1569.8400000000001s)]
*  So that's already happening and trending. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1571.68s)]
*  We don't notice it because we only see the current wars and the current conflicts. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1573.96s)]
*  We see it amplified in the news. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1577.3600000000001s)]
*  But things are getting much better on that front and should get much better exponentially [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1579.1200000000001s)]
*  as we take out the need for work. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1583.84s)]
*  My favorite example to give people a counterpoint is once you have abundant energy, which is [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1585.44s)]
*  coming shortly, then what are you fighting over? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1589.48s)]
*  Because oil was the thing we've been fighting over for the last hundred years. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1591.96s)]
*  And so there's all of that to think about as we change the underlying dynamics that will [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1595.6799999999998s)]
*  have some impact on conflicts. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1599.76s)]
*  Well, let's go let's go there on energy because I think it's very important. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1601.72s)]
*  We didn't talk about predictions for energy for twenty twenty five in our last episode. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1604.6399999999999s)]
*  But I do think we're going to start to see a real refocusing on resources and energy [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1609.0s)]
*  in particular in the United States. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1616.64s)]
*  And I think we're going to start to see fourth generation nuclear power plants becoming the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1617.96s)]
*  thing that's going to power our hyperscalers. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1622.8s)]
*  Absolutely. And small nuclear and fourth generation are going to change the game. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1627.28s)]
*  And if we don't do it, everybody else will. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1631.3600000000001s)]
*  And so it becomes incumbent that it has to be done. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1633.52s)]
*  It'll get done everywhere. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1636.24s)]
*  It's just the time lag until those things come online that we have to worry about. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1637.44s)]
*  And hopefully we can get through that without too much difficulty. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1641.48s)]
*  Do you think when do you predict fusion is going to come on? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1644.0s)]
*  I'm hearing a lot of conversation on Helion being actually delivering commercial grade [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1646.76s)]
*  by before twenty nine. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1652.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think solar and storage trump fusion because if you have solar at very, very low [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1656.0s)]
*  cost and storage at near low cost, at almost zero cost, and it's very it becomes very [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1663.4s)]
*  distributed and decentralized, that trumps fusion. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1669.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And so I think that'll take place before the need for fusion. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1672.96s)]
*  But fusion is definitely coming in, as we've been saying since the 60s, that's five years [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1676.76s)]
*  away. One of my favorite companies I advise is a company called Paranova, and it's a [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1680.6000000000001s)]
*  perovskite company. All right. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1686.44s)]
*  So folks, folks need to realize, you know, not all solar is made the same. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1688.0800000000002s)]
*  There's solar thermal where when I'm flying from here to Las Vegas and I fly my plane over [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1693.04s)]
*  these solar thermal, all these, you know, tens of thousands of mirrors all pointing the [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1698.4399999999998s)]
*  sun at the top of this tower where there's a molten salt and it's driving a generator. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1704.28s)]
*  That's great. And then there's photovoltaic, which are silicon. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1708.6799999999998s)]
*  And those are typically converting at like 20 percent efficiency. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1712.28s)]
*  Yeah. But then there's this material called perovskite. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1716.28s)]
*  And you and I were on stage talking about this years ago. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1718.96s)]
*  Yeah, we saw this, I think, in 2013 or 2014. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1722.56s)]
*  Yeah. It was in the labs for a few years. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1726.16s)]
*  Now it's gotten to commercial scale. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1728.2s)]
*  The only issue now is maintenance and how long will they last before the need for it. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1730.84s)]
*  But they're very inexpensive and therefore that gives us huge opportunity. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1735.04s)]
*  Here's the numbers. Conversion rate rather than like photovoltaic at 20 percent, these [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1738.32s)]
*  are at 30 percent higher conversion rate and it has the potential theoretically to get [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1743.0s)]
*  up to the mid 40s. And it's like 40 percent cheaper than silicon. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1748.28s)]
*  Yeah. And doesn't use rare earths because it's a widely available. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1754.6399999999999s)]
*  It's flexible and can be used in space. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1757.8799999999999s)]
*  So Paranova is one that I'm tracking in that regard. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1760.84s)]
*  I think energy, you know, if Trump is successful in his notion of we're going to [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1764.96s)]
*  become the most rapidly generating energy nation on the planet, that fuels massive [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1771.12s)]
*  tipping points across everything. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1780.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think the only issue there is climate and environmental concerns and nuclear [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1782.36s)]
*  trumps both of those. So nuclear kind of energy explosion, pun intended, in the U.S. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1789.0s)]
*  would be amazing from a generation perspective. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1795.24s)]
*  Well, I was in conversation with Eric Schmidt again in Riyadh and we're talking about [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1797.24s)]
*  energy and he was like, listen, we're going to solve the climate crisis by virtue of [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1801.76s)]
*  new breakthroughs in A.I. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1808.64s)]
*  And one of the things I'm seeing is countries are saying, listen, I know we made these [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1810.88s)]
*  commitments for, you know, reversing carbon emissions, but we can no longer abide by [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1816.52s)]
*  those because we need to produce more energy to win the A.I. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1824.16s)]
*  race and we can use A.I. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1827.1200000000001s)]
*  to solve our climate crisis later. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1829.24s)]
*  Thoughts? Well, two thoughts. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1832.8400000000001s)]
*  One is, nation states can solve climate change. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1835.0800000000002s)]
*  That's the wrong construct to do it. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1839.76s)]
*  And therefore, trying to do it at a country level through the U.N. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1841.2s)]
*  and through COP doesn't work and it will never work and hasn't ever worked at all. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1844.16s)]
*  That's number one. Number two, it's clearly a technological solution because even if we [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1847.96s)]
*  stop all fossil fuel emissions today, there's still too much carbon in the atmosphere. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1852.44s)]
*  Hence the carbon extraction exprize, which is so important that exprize is running. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1856.76s)]
*  So just by an aside for folks who don't know, I was able to get Ilan to put up [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1862.28s)]
*  one hundred million dollars for an exprize to remove carbon out of the atmosphere in [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1867.16s)]
*  the oceans. We launched that about five years ago or so. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1871.6000000000001s)]
*  And we are going to be basically awarding that in April of 2025. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1876.1599999999999s)]
*  So stay tuned. It's coming up very quickly. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1883.1599999999999s)]
*  That's an unbelievable. And what I remember hearing was there's massive numbers of teams [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1885.0s)]
*  that have applied in equally in rock sequestration, water and air. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1888.9199999999998s)]
*  And that gives incredible optimism. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1893.56s)]
*  We'll find a technological solution. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1895.28s)]
*  I remember talking to Al Gore about this and he said the best way to think about this is [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1897.3999999999999s)]
*  we have to run all of our mines and power plants backwards for 100 years. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1900.84s)]
*  That's how much carbon we have to extract and we have to figure that out. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1904.7199999999998s)]
*  It doesn't matter what else we do. We have to solve that problem. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1907.9599999999998s)]
*  So at Leader Stocks says what jobs will be in demand in the future? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1910.84s)]
*  Where should I focus my attention for myself and my kids? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1914.4799999999998s)]
*  At Leader Stocks, I think, focus your attention and your kids on what you're passionate [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1919.0s)]
*  about. Become a expert in the problem space. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1923.76s)]
*  And then every time new technology comes along, apply that to the problem space. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1926.9199999999998s)]
*  What do you tell people about jobs? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1931.6399999999999s)]
*  Exactly the same thing, because the last few hundred years we've been doing education and jobs [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1933.2s)]
*  on the supply side. You get to become an accountant, a doctor, an engineer, and you're trying to [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1937.24s)]
*  sell those skills in the job marketplace. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1940.76s)]
*  Now we're shifting to the demand side where we're saying what problem do you want to solve and then [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1943.56s)]
*  acquire the skills and technologies and capabilities to solve that problem. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1947.64s)]
*  And that's much more fulfilling than trying to figure out how to become an accountant and then [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1951.0s)]
*  spending your life trying to figure out how to sell those skills, which is a nightmare, which you [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1954.72s)]
*  never want to do because your parents wanted you to do it because they're Indian. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1958.6000000000001s)]
*  So now we can go to the demand side and solve all of that. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1962.1200000000001s)]
*  All right. One of our last questions from the community here is at gglab says, here's a [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1964.96s)]
*  philosophical question. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1968.52s)]
*  What if sleep was embedded into every single organism so that the simulation can save energy? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1970.1200000000001s)]
*  What's your take? I love that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1976.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm clear that we're living in a simulation. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1978.44s)]
*  I don't know how you feel about it. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1980.4s)]
*  No, no, we're on agreement on this. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1981.5600000000002s)]
*  I think you had the best framing of it. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1982.92s)]
*  That life is too goddamn interesting to be alive right now. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1984.4s)]
*  It has to be a simulation. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1987.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1988.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1988.96s)]
*  I think of it the following way. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1989.48s)]
*  When you look at all the research on sleep, the only viable means and necessary conditions and [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1991.72s)]
*  the only reason actually we can figure out that we actually have sleep is to do back end [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=1998.32s)]
*  processing and filing of all the sensory things that happen to us during the day. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2002.64s)]
*  And therefore, it's like literally batch processing of your day's inputs, which lends [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2008.28s)]
*  itself completely towards the fact that we must be living in a simulation because of the [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2015.12s)]
*  computational needs to sort of what happened and get ready for the next step. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2018.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2022.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to hit three final questions here. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2022.96s)]
*  So the first one, it's the end of 2024. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2024.8s)]
*  What are you focused on right now? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2027.52s)]
*  What are you focused on? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2031.08s)]
*  I'll tell you what I am. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2031.76s)]
*  I'm focused on what is the broad civilization, institutional transformation that needs to [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2033.08s)]
*  take place. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2040.8s)]
*  Now, do we get there? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2041.24s)]
*  That's my big MTP anyway. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2042.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2044.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2044.68s)]
*  It's a niche project. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2045.72s)]
*  I'm focused on the release of my new book called Longevity Guidebook, How to Slow, Stop, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2048.04s)]
*  Reverse Aging and Not Die from Something Stupid. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2052.88s)]
*  And that's coming out on January 3rd. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2055.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2058.76s)]
*  And for me, it's one of the most important books. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2059.52s)]
*  My goal is get it out into the world. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2061.92s)]
*  I'm providing it at cost to everybody. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2064.32s)]
*  If you buy on Amazon, it's twice the price. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2067.08s)]
*  But I donate those funds to the XPRIZE Foundation. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2069.96s)]
*  If you go to LongevityGuidebook.com, you can get it with a bunch of other benefits at the [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2073.1200000000003s)]
*  cheapest possible price. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2078.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2079.6000000000004s)]
*  What are you not focused on, Salim? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2079.76s)]
*  So what are you not focused on end of the year? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2082.92s)]
*  I'm not focused on everything that happened during 2024. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2085.36s)]
*  I want to put this year behind me as fast as possible. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2088.6000000000004s)]
*  It's one of those things when you're an entrepreneur, you go through ups and downs and [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2092.0s)]
*  this has been a tough year. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2094.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2096.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's not about the politics of... [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2096.36s)]
*  No, no. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2098.32s)]
*  Nothing to do with politics. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2098.6800000000003s)]
*  Just sheer startup chaos and madness. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2099.6800000000003s)]
*  You had some madness that you're over now and you're dominating and you're winning. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2102.08s)]
*  And I'm excited for your brother. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2105.92s)]
*  I am not focused on politics. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2107.52s)]
*  I don't focus on the past at all, really. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2109.4s)]
*  So I'm like, just forward vision. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2114.8s)]
*  I'm trying to be more present over the holidays here. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2117.28s)]
*  And the third question here is, do you take time off during this time of the year? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2120.28s)]
*  If so, how do you spend your time? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2123.92s)]
*  How about you, buddy? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2126.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2128.2s)]
*  I've got a stack of 45 books on my bedside table that I'm trying to read. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2129.8399999999997s)]
*  And God knows how many podcast episodes I'm trying to get to. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2133.92s)]
*  Also, every year, Lily and I do kind of an end of year completion to kind of really [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2137.44s)]
*  put the bow, a year in a bow and wrap it up and kind of go, OK, seal that away. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2141.52s)]
*  And then also visioning for what do we want to see accomplished as a family, as [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2145.6s)]
*  careers, from a health care perspective for the year coming. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2149.08s)]
*  So we'll work on that together. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2152.44s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2154.96s)]
*  I love this time of year. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2156.6s)]
*  It's me time. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2158.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a chance to actually do some deep thinking. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2160.12s)]
*  I'm focused on trying to get clear about what is my stop doing list. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2165.08s)]
*  What do I take off the table? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2171.2s)]
*  What boards do I resign from? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2173.52s)]
*  What things do I stop doing? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2175.96s)]
*  How do I refocus? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2178.48s)]
*  I think... [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2180.3199999999997s)]
*  Can I just comment on that? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2181.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2182.2s)]
*  You know, Steve Jobs used to say as a product, the hardest thing is to what [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2182.7599999999998s)]
*  feature is not to include. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2186.6s)]
*  And I think the stop doing list is such a critical thing because we overload [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2188.56s)]
*  ourselves so much. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2192.08s)]
*  I need to take that on. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2193.04s)]
*  Writing is done right now. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2194.24s)]
*  Stop doing more stuff. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2195.24s)]
*  As long as these podcasts with you and me are not on your stop doing list, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2198.6s)]
*  because I love them too much. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2202.36s)]
*  The other thing is it's a time to write. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2203.84s)]
*  So I love writing. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2205.88s)]
*  I hate writing. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2208.16s)]
*  You hate writing? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2209.44s)]
*  I hate writing. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2210.52s)]
*  OK, I love writing. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2211.2s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2212.68s)]
*  I'll do the writing for both of us. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2213.08s)]
*  I've got my book, next book after, a longevity guide book is called Mindset [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2214.56s)]
*  Mastery. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2220.24s)]
*  It's about 70, 80% done. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2220.8s)]
*  And then Steven Kotler and I just sold a book to Simon's sister called Age of [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2223.0s)]
*  Abundance, which will come out in 26. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2226.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2230.04s)]
*  And it's, and Steven's such a beautiful writer. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2230.32s)]
*  I'm always learning from him. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2232.6s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2233.36s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2234.28s)]
*  Can I tell a very quick anecdote? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2235.04s)]
*  Very quick. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2236.68s)]
*  I remember when Steve Jobs died, I got a ping from Vogue saying, would you [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2237.28s)]
*  read a little summary article about what happened and etc, etc. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2240.6s)]
*  I was like, I can't. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2244.68s)]
*  I'm in the middle of running an executive program. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2245.36s)]
*  I have no time. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2247.12s)]
*  And Steven Kotler of Pingsby goes, are you crazy? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2248.12s)]
*  Do you know how hard I work as a writer trying to get into it? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2250.68s)]
*  They're asking you and you're saying, no, you know, I'll help you. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2253.08s)]
*  And I wrote the article and he edited it and God damn the skill. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2256.56s)]
*  He made two little tweaks that made the whole thing pop. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2260.88s)]
*  And it was like, God damn the skill that people like that can bring to the table. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2263.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to do a quick shout out to you, Peter. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2268.24s)]
*  I think it's one of the things that's so amazing collaborating with users, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2270.28s)]
*  people that can think at a very, very high level and there's people that can [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2274.6400000000003s)]
*  execute like hell and get shit done. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2278.1600000000003s)]
*  And you have this unbelievable skill of being able to do both the top and the [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2280.2400000000002s)]
*  bottom and getting shit done. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSS8COCDlUo&t=2284.6400000000003s)]
