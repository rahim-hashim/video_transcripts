# The Proven Longevity Practices Extending Lifespans w/ Dr. Mark Hyman | EP #80
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I)
*  If you could tell somebody one thing to do to make a change in their life right now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=0.0s)]
*  What would that be? I think if there's one thing that people need to understand is that? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=7.12s)]
*  Aging as a phenomena has been ignored we focus on the diseases that happen as we get older [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=14.32s)]
*  But we haven't actually studied well the process of aging and if it's something that we can do something about could you go back? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=19.44s)]
*  to that earlier state of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=26.5s)]
*  The right genes on and the right genes off if we address those systematically with diet exercise sleep [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=28.58s)]
*  stress management reduction community relationships [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=36.94s)]
*  Certain biomolecules whether they're phytochemicals or pharmaceuticals that we actually have right now today [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=40.34s)]
*  I believe we can most of us get to in our 90s and a hundred [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=46.78s)]
*  Everybody Peter de man just here welcome to moonshots. I'm here with dr. Mark Hyman [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=53.46s)]
*  Who is just an extraordinary? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=58.74s)]
*  Human being first and foremost mark a pleasure to see you fell. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Peter. Thanks for having back [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=61.82s)]
*  You know it's you had these people in your life that you just love [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=67.74s)]
*  And you like hanging out with them. It's just like they could do no evil or harm [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=71.94s)]
*  But they're just you know, they lift your spirits and you're one of those individuals for me [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=75.92s)]
*  Yeah, and so when you're in L and over to Berkshires now when you're back in LA [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=79.76s)]
*  We're moving that way Peter. So I'm you're moving [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=84.5s)]
*  I'll be gonna be bothering you a lot [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  So you still you still in love my friend, oh my god love is the best drug it's the best [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=90.58s)]
*  You know, I I was there on one of your first dates with your fiance. I think yeah [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=96.58s)]
*  well, first of all, you were a huge idol for her and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=102.44s)]
*  I remember, you know, you you had said this thing around about taking a trip on one of their zero gravity flights [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=105.5s)]
*  Yeah, and it was one of her dreams to do that and and you were an idol and I called I called you and I said [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=111.7s)]
*  Hey Peter, you know, like can we go on your thing? You're like, yeah, we got some space [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=117.66s)]
*  I like there I said you want to go and she like her eyes bugged out of her head [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=121.06s)]
*  She's like it was like two dreams come true at once meeting you and going into zero gravity. I just you know [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=124.28s)]
*  By the way, you should look at her whatsapp profile because literally her whatsapp picture is her sitting in a meditation posture in the middle [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=130.62s)]
*  Of the air while she's a zero gravity on the plane. Oh my god [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=136.8s)]
*  What I remember was just you [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=142.14s)]
*  The two of you just were inseparable. It was this level of energy between you know young that young love [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=146.54s)]
*  I hope you have that for for a century to come my friend and yeah zero G is an amazing experience [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=152.06s)]
*  I've done [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=159.06s)]
*  God knows [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=160.48s)]
*  Probably 50 60 flights on that airplane and it's it's the only way to really simulate weightlessness [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=163.46s)]
*  In the atmosphere on the earth, it says it's a parabolic arc [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=169.82s)]
*  Am I one of my highlights in my life was flying? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=174.46s)]
*  Professor Stephen Hawking into zero G, you know the world's expert in gravity into into zero gravity and that was a that was a medical [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=177.18s)]
*  That was a risky maneuver and you know, I've talked about this publicly but [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=186.9s)]
*  You know when when we flew him [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=192.22s)]
*  The FDA [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=195.32s)]
*  The FAA said, you know, you can't do that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  You can't fly you can only fly able-bodied humans and I said well who determines whether they're able-bodied [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  And they said well his physician or an aerospace doctor so I got a few doctors to write letters [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=207.12s)]
*  Because he wanted to experience zero G and we did eight arcs [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  He had eight 30 second periods of weightlessness [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=218.0s)]
*  But we had set up an emergency room on the airplane we had three or four doctors two nurses because you know [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=220.76s)]
*  He was very osteoporotic, you know [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=227.1s)]
*  Easily break a bone puncture a lung and so we're super gentle with him, but he did it. He loved it. It was a highlight [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=230.16s)]
*  For me and and as he and his daughter Lucia said I liked for him as well. So [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  That was fun [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=244.64s)]
*  But not the sentence when you're when you're when you're stuck on the floor your gravity is pulling you it's it's an intense stress on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=245.64s)]
*  Your body it's amazing. You can handle that it is your you're you're pulling out [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  The airplane is basically doing this giant sine wave in the atmosphere [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  And you begin, you know straight level flight [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  And then you do a slight nose down to pick up speed and then the airplane pulls up at a 45 degree [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=265.32s)]
*  angle and during that pull up [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  You're at 1.8 gravity. So if you weighed 100 pounds [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=275.64000000000004s)]
*  You're now weighing 180 pounds and then as you push over the top of the arc [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  Centripetal force is pushing your body up gravity is pulling your body down [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  And if the pilot is flying the perfect trajectory where the velocity and the radius I can write up the physics for you here [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  But is perfect. You're in a arc of an orbit and you're weightless inside the middle [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=298.12s)]
*  So you go from 1.8 gravity to zero gravity and and sometimes we do lunar gravities and Martian gravities, which are fun as well [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=303.08s)]
*  so [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=311.76s)]
*  But you know one of my reasons for being interested in longevity is so I can be around an extra [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  3050 hundred years to see us on the moon, you know and go [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=321.28s)]
*  to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=327.56s)]
*  Build colonies and the asteroid belt one of the questions I have to wait that long because computer [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=328.48s)]
*  You know all this with all this talk about aliens and all this interesting stuff coming out [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=333.44s)]
*  There may be an alien spaceship. It'll just pop you over. It'll be easy. Well [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  Listen every night when I go to sleep [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=341.88s)]
*  I say [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  My prayer that if they're out there, please come and get me. I'd like to go home. They are trust me [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  I are they are I think literally seen alien spaceships who are astronauts in person. So [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=351.68s)]
*  You have seen them? No, I've talked to someone who was a black ops [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=357.9s)]
*  Astronaut who went to recover an alien spaceship that was in orbit and saw it himself [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=362.73999999999995s)]
*  Like listen, I and this guy's not kind of a crazy whack job either. He's done. I you know, that gives me great [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=367.21999999999997s)]
*  Hope, you know, honestly, I I think life is ubiquitous in the universe [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=373.34s)]
*  You know, it's interesting when you when you stop and think about the numbers, you know, we are so [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=378.73999999999995s)]
*  Egotistical as human beings we look at [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=384.02s)]
*  You know what we have in our town in our country on our planet, but [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  You know if you know the numbers, you know, you know many [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=395.5s)]
*  stars in our galaxy I [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=398.58s)]
*  Think I used to know it was like it's a hundred billion hundred billions billions [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  I took astronomy with Carl Sagan, but that was like [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=404.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, a hundred billion [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=411.17999999999995s)]
*  stars in our galaxy and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=414.02s)]
*  What's fascinating is the number of galaxies in the universe? Hmm. So [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=416.7s)]
*  The number used to be a hundred billion [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=421.53999999999996s)]
*  Galaxies in the universe. It's now up. So somewhere between two and twenty trillion [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=424.14s)]
*  Galaxies each with a hundred billion stars. Yeah, and if you do the math for my my physics or chemistry geeks out there [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=430.53999999999996s)]
*  It's there at one point I saw the numbers and I said, huh [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=439.46s)]
*  it's about like six times ten to the twenty-thirds like Avogadro's number worth of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=443.02s)]
*  Stars in the known universe and then of course, there are those who claim that we're living in a multiverse of an infinite number of universes [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=449.85999999999996s)]
*  So if you're feeling down [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=457.32s)]
*  Don't worry about it [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=460.02s)]
*  So I you know [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=462.38s)]
*  I do want to go and see what it's like to you know [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=463.74s)]
*  Start a city on the moon or go to the asteroid belt and one of the questions I ask [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=467.09999999999997s)]
*  My abundance members often is what would you do in the next 30 years of life? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=470.53999999999996s)]
*  Because I think we're gonna be able you know, I just launched this hundred and one million dollar health span prize with XPRIZE [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=475.34s)]
*  Asking for an extra 20 years of health and those extra 20 years buy you the next 20 years [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=483.38s)]
*  So what would you do mark with an extra 20 or 30 healthy years of life, you know for me at this point in my life [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  Peter it's a great question. I I kind of climbed all the mountains, you know [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=496.06s)]
*  There's a great book by David Brooks called the second mountain [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=500.0s)]
*  Which is once you've you know had your family built your career got your financial stability [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=502.53999999999996s)]
*  Then what right? I'm in the then what phase which is basically in service giving back and and providing [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=508.73999999999995s)]
*  The value that I've learned over my life back to the world and and for me it's it's really you know [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=515.54s)]
*  Both in terms of the work I'm going to do which is sort of scaling up [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=520.8199999999999s)]
*  The framework of our new understanding of human health and biology [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=525.06s)]
*  Which you could call network medicine functional medicine, whatever you want to call it [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=528.9s)]
*  It's just gonna be called medicine and the second is really, you know deepening my own [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=531.9s)]
*  personal development and growth and healing [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=536.3399999999999s)]
*  You know in the in the Hindu tradition [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=538.24s)]
*  There's this whole concept of the householder who then goes through this process of being a householder [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=540.7s)]
*  Which is essentially the first mountain and then they go and become a sannyasin, which is a wandering kind of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=545.22s)]
*  wise guy basically [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=551.46s)]
*  Or they they are they are seeking out the deeper spiritual evolution [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=552.98s)]
*  And I think for me that's very important to kind of deepen my sense of self [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=557.22s)]
*  my my sense of relation with myself with my [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=561.86s)]
*  fiance and partner with with my friends and community and with the people I care and love about so it's [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=564.9000000000001s)]
*  It's really being more leaning into that and of course having a hell of a good time while doing it [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=569.98s)]
*  Yes, maybe white said I think he said he said every day wake up [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=575.54s)]
*  Determined to make the world a better place and have a hell of a good time and that makes planning the day very difficult [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=580.38s)]
*  You know, I think [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=587.1s)]
*  Bringing joy to life is so important. You know, I've gotten know Elon really well over 20 plus years and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=589.26s)]
*  He's absolutely brilliant, but he's his own worst enemy in terms of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=597.82s)]
*  The level of stress and work and he puts it on himself [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=602.38s)]
*  And so, you know, I think about that, you know what? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=607.38s)]
*  You know humanity is a beneficiary for from SpaceX and from Tesla [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=610.62s)]
*  and and from X [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=616.38s)]
*  But you know at what price? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=619.1800000000001s)]
*  Do you do this and and life-work balance is an interesting term it's part of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=621.18s)]
*  It's part of the longevity conversation. I remember having this conversation with [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=627.06s)]
*  With Tony Robbins on stage and Tony goes no. No, there's no such thing as life-work balance. It's life-work integration [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=631.3s)]
*  And if you love what you do [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=638.0999999999999s)]
*  Which you do and I do and hopefully those listening to you then it's not you're not working you're playing [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=641.66s)]
*  And and that's I was looking at a tweet from Vinod Kocela who said [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=647.5s)]
*  You know working 80 hours a week and plan to do that and continue investing for the next 25 years [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=653.06s)]
*  And I was like, huh? I wonder how much I work and I either don't work at all or I work all the time [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=659.06s)]
*  Depending on how your definition is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=665.62s)]
*  So [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=670.26s)]
*  You know, let's talk get into the definition of life-work balance [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=671.66s)]
*  You know, let's talk get into the the meat of the conversation. I have a number of questions from my [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=675.5799999999999s)]
*  My I'm gonna still call it a Twitter audience, but and some of vegetables as it may be [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=681.86s)]
*  So, you know [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=689.02s)]
*  One of the conversations out there is aging a disease [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=691.3399999999999s)]
*  and if so, why right and [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=695.06s)]
*  You know, I think it would be super convenient to call aging a disease so that we had the ability [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=698.9399999999999s)]
*  For it to be funded from government, you know government research and so forth [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=705.54s)]
*  Do you have any opinion about this? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think you know Peter what we've seen [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=710.0999999999999s)]
*  Historically in medicine is that aging as a phenomena has been ignored [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=714.54s)]
*  We focus on the diseases that happen as we get older, but we haven't actually studied [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=718.86s)]
*  well the process of aging and if it's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=723.4599999999999s)]
*  Something that we can do something about and I think also we see inevitability as we get older [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=726.74s)]
*  We see people who are frail and weak and decrepit and declining and loss of function and an inability to do the normal things [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=732.14s)]
*  They want to do but that's not necessarily an inevitable part of getting older [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=738.28s)]
*  it's a process of [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=743.8199999999999s)]
*  decrepitude that is a result of [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=746.18s)]
*  fundamental biological processes that go wrong that we can do something about just like we can treat blood pressure or [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=748.3s)]
*  cholesterol or blood sugar the phenomena of [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=754.74s)]
*  Abnormal aging which is what I think most of us have in this country and around the world increasingly is a treatable condition and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=758.26s)]
*  And I I've seen this over and over in my patients whether they're an end-stage diseases or whether they're just looking for a tune-up [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=764.9799999999999s)]
*  I've seen people both feel and look younger by applying the science of [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=771.78s)]
*  creating health so I mean yes and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=777.5799999999999s)]
*  Even though we're doing that we still are getting older and dying and there's nobody [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=780.9000000000001s)]
*  Living past 120 that at least I know of I mean there may be some Himalayan monks who claim that [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=787.46s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, but so the question I've always asked myself and I've asked [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=795.1800000000001s)]
*  George [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=800.3000000000001s)]
*  George Church and David Sinclair this question is there an upper limit to human age? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=801.38s)]
*  Age you know can we make it to 150 can we make it to two or three hundred? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=807.54s)]
*  You know not as we are today [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=811.9799999999999s)]
*  But with the right genetic engineering and the right cellular [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=814.9s)]
*  therapies or or others [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=821.14s)]
*  I'm curious where you come out on that [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=823.66s)]
*  Do you do you is it religion? Do you hope do you have a sense to say no, it's impossible [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=826.8599999999999s)]
*  No, I mean I I first of all the question of immortality and experience [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=832.0999999999999s)]
*  and extending life and say mortality [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  That's more of like a kind of spiritual philosophical question about like what what what will you do with all that time? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=840.6999999999999s)]
*  but I think in terms of the the the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=846.4599999999999s)]
*  science I think if we apply to what we know now about the fundamental things that cause [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=849.1s)]
*  damage to what we call the hallmarks of aging and [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=855.62s)]
*  And and drive these biological processes that underlie all of disease heart disease cancer diabetes dementia all the disease of aging [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=858.26s)]
*  If if we address those systematically with diet exercise sleep [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=866.2199999999999s)]
*  stress management reduction community relationships certain [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=872.66s)]
*  biomolecules whether they're [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=877.14s)]
*  Phytochemicals or pharmaceuticals that we actually have right now today in 2023 soon to be 24 [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=878.38s)]
*  I believe we can most of us get to in our 90s and 100 [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=884.62s)]
*  I don't think that's beyond reach for most people I do think that getting to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=888.8599999999999s)]
*  120 or 150 or 180 is a whole different ballgame and I think there are some regenerative therapies that may help [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=893.9s)]
*  whether they're things like you know exosomes or peptides or stem cells or [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=900.34s)]
*  Osmophoresis which are really interesting. I don't know if those are gonna get us much more runway [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=906.42s)]
*  They might get a little bit more they might improve health span more [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=911.38s)]
*  But I think there are some scientific things coming down the pike that are really interesting and and are not ready for prime time [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=914.58s)]
*  I think one of the most important ones is the discovery of the Amanaka factors [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=920.9s)]
*  What you write about in life force and and this is being studied by David Sinclair and others in animal models and seeing really kind [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=924.66s)]
*  Of remarkable results, but the basic idea is that we can reprogram our own [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=931.5s)]
*  Cells back to a younger version of themselves in sort of a simplistic way of looking at it. It's by inserting [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=936.22s)]
*  very various transcription factors into your genome you can turn them on or off at will and [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=943.5s)]
*  When you hit let's say 50 if you've had these inserted 25 and you say I'm getting a little flabby [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=949.94s)]
*  My muscles wasting my hair is gray and I don't have the same sex drive and whatever [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=954.42s)]
*  You can just turn this on through some molecular switch and then reverse your biological age now [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=959.5s)]
*  That's still a TBD, right? I think we don't know [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=966.82s)]
*  the conversation I have with George and David is is [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=971.46s)]
*  And I'm curious to bring bring that into this conversation because it's important [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=975.38s)]
*  I mean people need to have a goal to shoot for and I think the goal right now is [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  Keep yourself with healthy as you can't intercept the breakthroughs from the Yamanaka factors epigenetic reprogramming all of that [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=987.14s)]
*  I mean when a when when you are [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=993.3s)]
*  You know 30 or 40 or 50 as a guy [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=997.18s)]
*  And in your 20s and 30s as a woman [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1000.78s)]
*  Typically and you reproduce that egg is set at a zero age and it can live an entire full life [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1004.02s)]
*  The data is there for a for continuation [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1009.2199999999999s)]
*  At the same time, you know, I remind people [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1013.5s)]
*  It's true to kind of reemphasize what you're saying [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1016.4599999999999s)]
*  If a 40 year old man a 40 woman have sex and they have a 40 year old sperm and a 40 year old egg [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1019.06s)]
*  The baby is not 40 years old when it's born. It's zero. Yeah, it's zero [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1024.5s)]
*  So the potential is there [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1028.82s)]
*  And then the other thing I point out at folks is listen [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1031.14s)]
*  You've got the same three point two billion letters from your mother and your father when you're born when you're 21 [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1035.1000000000001s)]
*  You're 80 when you're 100. Why do you look different and it's not the code. It's not your genome [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1039.6200000000001s)]
*  It's which genes are on and which genes are off [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1045.08s)]
*  it's your epigenome and if you can you could you go back to that earlier state of [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1046.94s)]
*  the right genes on and the right genes off of [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1052.14s)]
*  Earlier so you get that six-pack when you're when you're you know in your in your 70s or 80s [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1055.1799999999998s)]
*  and so this is the conversation and then [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1062.02s)]
*  You know, it's the other idea that is thrown out is, you know, this is my grandfather's old hatchet [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1065.2199999999998s)]
*  It's got four new handles and five new heads, but it's my grandfather's old hatchet [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1070.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, can you just keep replacing parts? Yeah [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1076.02s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the other thing that's coming down the pike is replacement parts, right? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1079.08s)]
*  We can 3d print organs we can you know from your own cells [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1082.8s)]
*  Basically grow a new heart or grow a new liver [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1087.56s)]
*  I mean this is happening and I think you've been talking about this and many of your [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1089.64s)]
*  Conferences and workshops and I I think it's it's kind of exciting [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1094.56s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to be the first one to get it but [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1098.02s)]
*  It's gonna it's gonna cut it's gonna come soon and the reason it's coming even faster [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1101.16s)]
*  I think is more capital is coming into this field than ever before [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1106.28s)]
*  Right, there's billions of dollars of private capital coming in [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1110.2s)]
*  Because you still can't take it with you no matter how hard you tried [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1114.76s)]
*  because ultimately [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1118.78s)]
*  There's more people playing in this field. The tools are getting more powerful and cheaper and AI is coming into the rescue [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1120.76s)]
*  So, you know, I think we're gonna see some massive massive changes [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  If you could tell somebody one thing to do to make a change in their life right now [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1132.64s)]
*  Would that be I mean, you know, it reminds me of [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1139.68s)]
*  This conference I was that was asked the same question to a longevity scientist Leonard Gwart Gwarty from MIT [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1142.72s)]
*  basically came up with David Sinclair with the idea of the sirtuins and [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1148.92s)]
*  I and it was this conference with the Dalai Lama and longevity and it was Western scientists [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1152.44s)]
*  Elizabeth Blackburn was there and Lenny was there and [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1157.52s)]
*  Dalai Lama was there at least Tibetan doctors and I was walking with Lenny. I think so what is the secret here? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1161.0s)]
*  What is the secret what these are doing and what is the deal he says what's making us age and what's the problem [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1166.48s)]
*  He's like sugar and I'm like what he's like, yeah sugar [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1172.58s)]
*  and I think I think if there's one thing that people need to understand is that [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1176.24s)]
*  One of the main I think meta categories of the hallmarks of aging is deregulated [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1180.32s)]
*  Nutrient sensing which has to do with how our bodies sense food and when that becomes screwed up [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1185.44s)]
*  Because of too much or too little something our bodies become dysregulated and all the hallmarks get accelerated all and I think [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1190.6s)]
*  The most important insulin signaling pathway there is the one that's driving a lot of the disease of aging [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1198.3999999999999s)]
*  So if you look at heart disease cancer diabetes dementia [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1203.6399999999999s)]
*  They're all diseases of too much insulin and insulin resistance and that's all driven by the enormous loads of sugar and starch [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1206.0s)]
*  We eat, you know [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1213.04s)]
*  I was recently Peter in Africa and I got to visit the Hadzi be tribe [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1214.08s)]
*  Which is the last remaining hunter-gatherer tribe that's protected in Africa and they continue to hunt and 20% of their diet is honey [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1217.92s)]
*  And I'm like, geez, that's a lot of sugar [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1224.96s)]
*  and and what I also learned was that and I went gathering with them and we hunted and gathered a little bit together and [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1226.96s)]
*  They were you know digging up these roots and tubers and they eat 150 grams of fiber a day [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1233.3600000000001s)]
*  That's compared to about eight eight grams for the average American the uptake and the reaction basically [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1239.8000000000002s)]
*  It's like it's basically putting menmusal in your Coca-Cola basically [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1245.84s)]
*  But it but it mitigates the effect of the sugar [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1250.76s)]
*  So I think it's just the enormous amounts of starts and sugar that are driving all these aging pathways and they drive inflammation [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1253.0s)]
*  They drive oxidative stress. They damage her mitochondria. I can't stress this enough biome [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1258.6s)]
*  It's it's the one thing if you can cut out starch and sugar or dramatically reduce it [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1263.1599999999999s)]
*  It's gonna have a huge impact everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1267.36s)]
*  That's very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you love company is called fountain life [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1271.68s)]
*  It's company. I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented physicians [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1279.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. We're all optimists [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1285.0s)]
*  Until that day where you have a pain in your side you go to the physician in the emergency room and they say listen [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1291.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry to tell you this but you have [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1296.6000000000001s)]
*  This stage three or four going on and you know, it didn't start that morning [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1298.6s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time, but because we never look we don't find out [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1303.6999999999998s)]
*  So what we built at fountain life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1310.6399999999999s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1316.3799999999999s)]
*  These centers give you a full-body MRI a brain a brain [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1320.8s)]
*  Vascular an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque a DEXA scan a grail blood cancer test a full [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1324.88s)]
*  Executive blood workup. It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1332.92s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease at the very beginning [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1338.0800000000002s)]
*  When it's solvable you're gonna find out eventually [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1346.48s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action fountain life also has an entire side of therapeutics [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1349.5200000000002s)]

*  We had 30,000 people reached out to us for fountain life memberships [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1376.32s)]
*  You go to fountain life comm backslash Peter will put you to the top of the list [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1381.1999999999998s)]
*  really, it's something that is [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1386.52s)]
*  For me one of the most important things I offer my entire family the CEOs of my companies my friends [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1388.84s)]
*  It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1395.1999999999998s)]
*  Go to fountain life comm backslash Peter [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1400.56s)]
*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1403.28s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode sugar is a poison [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1407.1200000000001s)]
*  I remove it from your diet [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1409.92s)]
*  The body was never designed to deal with this much sugar and we're living in a day and age where unfortunately our food [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1411.4s)]
*  Manufacturers are pumping out [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1418.84s)]
*  You know poison the same way our cigarette manufacturers were more pumping out poison [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1420.92s)]
*  They were the same company, you know, like Peter like Philip Morris Kraft RGR Nabisco [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1425.6799999999998s)]
*  They they actually redesigned the foods when they own those companies [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1430.1999999999998s)]
*  They now have kind of divested but but when they the tobacco openings companies own the food companies [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1432.84s)]
*  They redesigned the foods to be more addictive that comes to a question that Enos [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1437.56s)]
*  Sirac one of my followers asked here says how do you deal with the emotional challenges of sugar addiction? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1442.4399999999998s)]
*  so to be clear sugar is and [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1449.6s)]
*  Your you get addicted to sugar and [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1453.16s)]
*  It's it takes time [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1457.44s)]
*  To get off of that addiction and I do that by the way [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1460.3600000000001s)]
*  In this with my you know abundance community every year we do a 22 day [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1465.24s)]
*  No sugar fast as a group. We all do it together. We just give it all up [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1470.02s)]
*  And once you've gone through that [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1475.24s)]
*  Process you have more control. How do you think about it? It's an emotional issue [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1478.74s)]
*  Well, yes and no, I mean, I think I think people think it is and and sometimes it is and it's a physiological issue [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1484.22s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1491.8999999999999s)]
*  it's complex right because there's there's genetics involved and dopamine receptors and your your risk of becoming [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1492.1399999999999s)]
*  More addictive when it comes to sugar other substances [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1499.02s)]
*  There's the way that sugar hijacks your hormones your brain chemistry even your microbiome to regulate your mood your appetite your behavior [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1502.26s)]
*  And a lot of times people misappropriate their emotional state to some [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1509.1799999999998s)]
*  Psychological reason as opposed to a physiological reason and I think you know [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1514.1399999999999s)]
*  Most of us have the experience like if we're you know, if our blood sugar low, we're cranky, right? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1519.3799999999999s)]
*  If we're if we're having eaten it's not because we're mean irritable cranky people as because there's a physiological reason [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1523.82s)]
*  So I think I think it's important first to understand that it sometimes there are emotional reasons for eating that stress and [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1530.3799999999999s)]
*  various kinds of things [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1536.1799999999998s)]
*  Comfort foods as they call for sure for sure [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1537.4199999999998s)]
*  But but but what's what's important to understand is that you need to use science not willpower [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1540.1399999999999s)]
*  To actually overcome this and I wrote a book in 2014 called the 10-day detox diet the blood sugar solution 10-day detox diet [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1545.4599999999998s)]
*  And the idea is you know [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1552.4199999999998s)]
*  If you you follow a regimented approach to resetting your hormones and brain chemistry in your microbiome [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1554.02s)]
*  You can get off of it very quickly and not deal with the consequences [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1560.58s)]
*  It usually takes about two or three days to go through it [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1564.24s)]
*  But if you but if you do the right things you don't suffer as much so you got to start the day with protein and fat [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1567.1399999999999s)]
*  You got to actually eat plenty of fiber. You've got to have lots of fluids and liquid because when you drop [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1571.94s)]
*  Sugar your body is going to dump a lot of fluid and and because insulin keeps you [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1579.3799999999999s)]
*  retaining salt and so you retain a lot of water and [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1583.86s)]
*  And then you need to make sure you do things with your nervous system to calm your nervous system down and I you know [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1586.46s)]
*  Take an epsom salt bath and gentle exercise and you know really doing simple practices [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1591.3400000000001s)]
*  And and I've done this with people over and over groups and and online thousands of people and it's remarkable [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1596.68s)]
*  How quickly the body resets it doesn't take that long now, you know, it's like [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1603.5600000000002s)]
*  It's like if you're if you you kind of have to go cold turkey [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1609.1000000000001s)]
*  You're gonna kind of just be constantly just in this dynamic of stimulating the wrong pathways so it's there is an emotional aspect [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1613.16s)]
*  But there's also an understanding and for example [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1621.28s)]
*  You can look at your genetics and look at dopamine receptor genetics and see if you're one of those people who really needs a lot of [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1624.2s)]
*  extra stimulation for dopamine [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1629.22s)]
*  Which then you can learn how to activate like a cold plunge if you jump in an ice bath [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1630.68s)]
*  I guarantee you it's gonna wake you right off as you know your dopamine and and I love doing that [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I forget how long I'm in there and I come out I'm like shaking but but [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1641.48s)]
*  Feels great after it feels great. Yeah, it feels great and and there's really a [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1646.76s)]
*  Physiological process to reset so it's not that hard [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1652.8400000000001s)]
*  But you have to understand what to do and how to do it and how to [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1655.28s)]
*  Re-regulate your hormones and bring him and then you can see where you're at and then you know [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1658.24s)]
*  But if you're if you're sleep-deprived, that's the other thing if you're sleep deprived [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1661.96s)]
*  And they've done this in college students where they've looked at healthy college students a normal weight [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1666.24s)]
*  And they gave them basically [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1670.6s)]
*  Normal sleep schedule or they were deprived of like, you know couple extra hours of sleep [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1673.6s)]
*  So they had sleep [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1677.24s)]
*  It's like eight or six or five hours and the ones who had sleep deprivation all were craving sugar and carbs [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1677.84s)]
*  And I remember this from being in the internship and residency and delivering babies up all night working in the ER [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1683.3s)]
*  I'm like it was like 2 a.m. And I was like, where is the sugar? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1689.12s)]
*  Like I'm going to McDonald's and because the only thing open in the hospital by the way having McDonald's the hospital is ridiculous [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1692.84s)]
*  But I would get one of the Apple turnovers. That was my that was my thing [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1698.36s)]
*  So I get the Apple turnover and keep going for the rest of the night. Oh, yeah [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1702.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's it listen in medical school [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1707.4399999999998s)]
*  By the way, those of you who are thinking about going to medical school those who had been in medical school [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1709.9199999999998s)]
*  It is like the worst [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1714.36s)]
*  possible [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1716.8s)]
*  set of [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1718.56s)]
*  Operating protocols for a help. I mean doctors are terrible in terms of sleepless the diets [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  We eat taking a stress that levels that you have [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1725.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1728.6799999999998s)]
*  So, you know, let's take a second to explain to folks why? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1730.24s)]
*  Glucose is such an inflammatory molecule, right how it it's glycosylating and how it's [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1735.04s)]
*  You know in in the brain in the heart [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1742.1599999999999s)]
*  Would you walk through that second? Yeah, so so the couple things happen like it's just a whole cascade [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1745.0s)]
*  So it's you know, when you when you have high insulin levels it drives [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1749.24s)]
*  Your glucose into your cells and also any [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1753.6399999999999s)]
*  Every extra calorie it drives free fatty acids and other things into your fat cells and particularly your belly fat [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1756.3999999999999s)]
*  And those are the dangerous fat cells and and those fat cells aren't like normal fat cells on your body or legs [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1761.96s)]
*  They're they're metabolically active. They're hormonal factories. They're neurotransmitter factories [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1767.36s)]
*  They're immune factories and they're spewing out all this nasty stuff including cytokines and hormones that dysregulate your appetite [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1771.9199999999998s)]
*  And so they make you hungry they make you put on more weight and they prevent what we call like [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1780.52s)]
*  Policists which is the breakdown of fat so it's like a one-way turnstile in the subway [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1786.68s)]
*  You can get in but you can't get out and and essentially that's what's going on with insulin [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1790.24s)]
*  And then once you start this this visceral that [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1794.2s)]
*  Factory of bad stuff [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1799.08s)]
*  That bad stuff drives inflammation and you get high levels of inflammation [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1801.24s)]
*  Cytokines and inflammation is [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1805.3999999999999s)]
*  Kind of the final common pathway of all age-related diseases, whether it's dementia heart disease diabetes cancer [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1808.08s)]
*  obviously autoimmune disease aging itself has been called the inflammation and so [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1814.1599999999999s)]
*  It drives a lot of that process [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1818.6399999999999s)]
*  The secondary things that happen is that it is part of that you get damaged to proteins and one of the one of the main [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1821.52s)]
*  Phenomena in terms of the hallmarks of aging is something called proteostasis [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1829.6s)]
*  Which is damaged to our proteins and proteins have to be particularly shape size and and in three-dimensional structure [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1833.0s)]
*  To work and what happens is you get glomming on of sugar and proteins together when there's too much sugar [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1839.52s)]
*  And it causes thing called glycation [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1845.6s)]
*  Which is basically like a crispy skin on chicken or a crust on a bread or creme brulee that crispy thing on the top [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1847.8799999999999s)]
*  And stuff that you love to eat [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1854.4199999999998s)]
*  Now those are called advanced glycation end products and our ages and [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1857.22s)]
*  Good terminology because they age you and they bind to rages which makes you rage and and basically get aged [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1862.1000000000001s)]
*  and that leads to again the secondary phenomena of more inflammation and [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1868.78s)]
*  So when you have damaged proteins, they don't work to you creates a cascade of more inflammation [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1874.3000000000002s)]
*  And you end up in this vicious cycle and the way we measure for example people with diabetes is something called hemoglobin a1c [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1879.8200000000002s)]
*  That's like oscillating hemoglobin. It means hemoglobin. You're basically [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1885.34s)]
*  oxygen carrying molecule in your red cells gets [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1889.82s)]
*  sugar on it and forms a crust and that crust basically makes it not work well and then you get into all these secondary problems and [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1892.74s)]
*  And that really is is a huge phenomena of aging and then we can avoid ages in our food too by not [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1900.1399999999999s)]
*  Microwaving by you know, not over over cooking stuff by not having the crispy stuff, which we love [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1906.02s)]
*  I still eat it occasionally make a roast chicken and I I go after the skin [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1911.46s)]
*  I get to cut it off because I cooked it and I get the [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1915.38s)]
*  So I just went to realize, you know sugar is a it's a very you know as it is [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1922.78s)]
*  Glacier glomming onto the to the proteins and your immune system recognizes that as a foreign [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1929.18s)]
*  Entity and you hit an inflammatory cascade it's it hits the heart it hits the brain it hits the body in general and it's just [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1935.4199999999998s)]
*  do yourself the favor of [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1945.02s)]
*  Breaking that sugar addiction if at all possible [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1948.1399999999999s)]
*  Your your book on that subject the name of it again 10-day detox diet [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1950.9399999999998s)]
*  10-day and and you know, the beautiful the beautiful thing is it, you know probably hasn't changed [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1956.86s)]
*  Since in the last in the last decade, so it's relevant go get it and and try it you owe yourself [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1962.3400000000001s)]
*  Getting yourself off sugar [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1968.74s)]
*  No, I mean that I what I would say is Peter just to emphasize that people don't realize how bad they feel until they start feeling [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1971.3s)]
*  Good and and I have people fill out a questionnaire [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1978.14s)]
*  It's in the book where they give a quality quantitative score to all their symptoms [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1980.9s)]
*  You know headaches digestive issues sleep problems depression [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1985.22s)]
*  Snoddy nose, whatever and you get a score and then after 10 days you redo it the average reduction in the score was 70% [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1988.3s)]
*  From all symptoms from all diseases and I do this over and over when I do workshops [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1995.66s)]
*  I'm doing a longevity workshop in Ibiza in May another one in [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=1999.98s)]
*  Bodrum and Turkey then in May at six senses and and and I do the same diet there and it's it's just remarkable [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2004.74s)]
*  What happens people walk away feeling amazing and they didn't realize how quickly it can happen [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2012.14s)]
*  And guess what it's all within your control. It doesn't cost anything [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2016.6599999999999s)]
*  No, anything you're gonna save money on the process. Yeah, one of the things I put in in my recent [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2021.86s)]
*  Book longevity or practical playbook and and we've talked about this before is even the order which you eat your food [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2029.22s)]
*  Matters, right? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2036.78s)]
*  Eating your fiber first eating your veggies first so that it slows down digestion eating your protein next and then [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2038.3799999999999s)]
*  Saving any high glycemic carbs for the end if you have room [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2044.3999999999999s)]
*  And just doing that alone [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2050.4s)]
*  causes your digestive system to uptake the nutritious molecules first and and minimizes your [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2053.12s)]
*  Insulin spike from you know, the white rice or the bread that you're gonna be or the does god forbid the dessert you're gonna eat at the end [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2058.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2066.04s)]
*  Everybody Peter de Amanda's here. I've been asked over and over again. What do I do for my own health? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2067.36s)]
*  Well, I put it down in this book called Peter's longevity practices [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2072.44s)]
*  It's very readable in just an hour in the book. I cover longevity diet [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2076.6000000000004s)]
*  Exercise sleep my annual found upload meds and supplements longevity mindset [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2081.8s)]
*  It's literally consumable in just an hour's time [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2087.44s)]
*  Hopefully to incentivize you to make a difference in your life to intercept the technologies coming our way [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2090.76s)]
*  If you want this just check out the link below and download it right now [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2095.7200000000003s)]
*  A lot of people are dealing with this with ozempic GLP one [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2099.6s)]
*  inhibitors and such [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2105.88s)]
*  I'm curious what you're hearing about ozempic, you know [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2107.92s)]
*  It's like everybody I know is I'm ozempic and it's like, you know [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2111.76s)]
*  The most all of a sudden it became the most popular drug out there [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2116.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's the biggest part of the GDP of Denmark right now. It's the same pick [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2120.36s)]
*  Because it's a dumb Danish company [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2125.6s)]
*  Yeah, I know Peter it can help certain people and I'm not opposed to its [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2128.2s)]
*  Appropriate use the appropriate person for the appropriate amount of time in the right way [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2133.04s)]
*  But I think like like many many drugs the New England Journal basically came out with a great article once [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2136.4s)]
*  They said make sure you use new drugs as soon as they come on the market before the side effects develop [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2142.2s)]
*  I think that's kind of the situation we're starting to see now [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2146.0s)]
*  We're seeing you know benefits for people to struggle [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2149.2s)]
*  But I've seen people who are you know, 10 20 15 pounds always starting to use this it's I think it's risky one [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2151.52s)]
*  It causes a significant amount of muscle loss as you lose weight and you already lose muscle when you lose weight [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2157.44s)]
*  But it seems to be worse and then you end up actually with a lower muscle mass and a lower weight [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2163.42s)]
*  Which actually means your metabolism is slower. So [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2169.64s)]
*  often [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2173.52s)]
*  What happens and with with weight ozempic we see this 65 percent or more of the weight is gained back if you stop it [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2174.8399999999997s)]
*  You will end up having a slower metabolism [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2182.2799999999997s)]
*  At the end of the process than when you started so let's see started 220 pounds you lost [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2185.6s)]
*  30 pounds then you came back to a bunch of pounds [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2190.12s)]
*  You're gonna have a slower metabolism and have to eat less to just maintain that 220 pounds at the end [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2192.4s)]
*  Second it seems to increase the risk of certain GI problems [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2197.56s)]
*  Which I really concerns me and it's not just an incremental increase [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2202.52s)]
*  We've talked about this before but essentially when we see a you know a change in a [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2207.36s)]
*  Result in a scientific study of 20 30 percent. So statins reduce their risk of heart attack by 20 or 30 percent [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2212.8s)]
*  That sounds like a lot. Okay [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2219.52s)]
*  That's not that much when you look at the effect of these ozempic drugs [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  There's we're seeing a nine hundred percent increase in a pancreatitis a four hundred and fifty percent increase in [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2226.1200000000003s)]
*  Small bowel obstruction, which is a very serious disease [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2232.8s)]
*  This is a problem where you need surgery or hospitalization [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2235.4s)]
*  To deal with the bowel obstruction because it thickens the wall of your bowel and it happens when you've been taking it for a longer [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2238.6s)]
*  period of time, so you might see rapid results, but I [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2244.56s)]
*  Think I think it does kind of misses the point of why are we struggling in the first place? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2248.04s)]
*  You know, I I went again [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2254.08s)]
*  I mentioned I went to Africa and and I I didn't see anybody who was overweight and these hunter-gathered tribes [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2256.32s)]
*  There was nobody not a single person [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2262.7200000000003s)]
*  You know when you look at pictures of America and I remember seeing this Aretha Franklin movie it was from 1970 [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2264.64s)]
*  It was in Oakland where she filmed it. It was an incredible film about and they called amazing grace or something and and [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2270.36s)]
*  You know, it was in a black church in Oakland [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2277.44s)]
*  There was not one overweight person including Aretha in that movie who was in the church and this was [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2279.88s)]
*  1970 and now you know 85 percent of African women are overweight [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2287.04s)]
*  So [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2291.16s)]
*  Let's let's dive there. What second? What is the cause? Is it our food system? Is it lack of what has changed in the last? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2292.68s)]
*  40 years here [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2300.52s)]
*  Well, I think we never had the degree of ultra processed foods and I think it's becoming clear and clear [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2301.52s)]
*  But this phenomenon of ultra processed foods is at the root of so much of what's going on [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2306.3199999999997s)]
*  Of course our lifestyles become more sedentary. We've had more stress [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2310.48s)]
*  There's more environmental toxins our microbiome changes a lot of variables [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2314.64s)]
*  But but I think the big fundamental biggest change is the introduction of ultra processed food [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2318.92s)]
*  There's over 600,000 of these on the market now and and what what they are not really foods [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2324.48s)]
*  they're deconstructed food like products, so essentially when you take a [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2329.5200000000004s)]
*  soybean or a corn cob or a [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2334.8s)]
*  Wheat berry you eat those you're fine [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2338.0400000000004s)]
*  It's fine [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2340.28s)]
*  but if you if you take them into a factory and you deconstruct them into their molecular parts and then you [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2340.92s)]
*  Reorganize the molecular structure [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2347.44s)]
*  So they're not even recognizable in their original form and then you reassemble them into all kinds of sizes colors and shapes of chemiline [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2349.0s)]
*  Extruded food like substances that look like food but aren't food [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2356.6800000000003s)]
*  They actually don't regulate your body in the same way and and Kevin Hall did this very impressive study [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2360.2400000000002s)]
*  He's from the NIH looking at ultra processed food [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2366.84s)]
*  It was a crossover trial where he took people and fed them as much as they want of regular whole foods [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2369.36s)]
*  Just eat as much you want no limit go for it and then he said here's ultra processed food eat as much you want [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2374.52s)]
*  No limit go for it. The people have the ultra processed food ate 500 calories more a day now in a week. That's [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2381.36s)]
*  3,500 calories 3,500 calories is what it takes to gain a pound [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2390.2400000000002s)]
*  So in a year, that's 52 pounds of weight gain just from eating if you eat your ultra processed food [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2394.12s)]
*  Oversize me baby. Yeah, and and so [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2400.2400000000002s)]
*  It's it's really been a problem and then we know the mortality risk is high it causes depression it causes mood [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2403.3199999999997s)]
*  destabilization inflammation [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2409.56s)]
*  It changes your microbiome and I think we've seen this is horrific change in our food system and supply and of course [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2411.2s)]
*  there's the you know, just the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2417.9199999999996s)]
*  Overabundance of calories in our system as well. I mean we've seen you know in [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2420.48s)]
*  1970s Earl president Nixon was afraid of not getting reelected because the price of milk and meat were going up [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2425.3599999999997s)]
*  So he told his ag secretary to fix it and basically what he did was incentivize farmers to grow [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2430.48s)]
*  Mass amounts by giving subsidies and and essentially created a model of an accelerated industrial agriculture and high fructose corn syrup [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2435.36s)]
*  And now we produce 500 calories more of corn essentially turning to corn sugar and syrup than we did before [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2443.4s)]
*  So there's another 500 calories a day in the food supply per person [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2449.56s)]
*  Crunch [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2453.08s)]
*  Captain crunch is there to save us. I mean, it's like I [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2455.28s)]
*  Have two 12 year old boys and I think about the food that they eat and it's like us. Oh my god [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2459.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh my god. So listen, I was just on I saw on on Twitter [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2463.48s)]
*  yesterday a [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2469.32s)]
*  gentleman whose ID was kept confidential who's experimented with a follow statin [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2471.12s)]
*  CRISPR at it and [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2477.6s)]
*  Yeah [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2479.7599999999998s)]
*  Someone in their 40s 50s and all of a sudden gained a huge amount of muscle, right? So [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2480.96s)]
*  Have you seen any of this work going on? Yeah, I mean I've been reading about it. I think it's a [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2486.4s)]
*  Little bit sci-fi and and there's been studies for example in muscular dystrophy that improves for example [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2492.6s)]
*  Ambulation and muscle strength and function so for certain conditions [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2499.8399999999997s)]
*  I think you know if you have muscular dystrophy and you're gonna put a wheelchair and die [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2503.56s)]
*  I think it's go for it, you know, but I think I'm not ready to start taking it yet [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2507.02s)]
*  I think we need I think a lot more human trials for it [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2512.06s)]
*  But it hasn't even started really in that regard, but I'm I am interested in [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2515.62s)]
*  In the concept of beginning to [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2522.54s)]
*  Engineer ourselves, you know someone who I've known for a long time [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2526.1s)]
*  Haven't been in touch lately is is Brian Johnson [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2531.74s)]
*  New from he was an investor in my companies early on [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2537.34s)]
*  Have you been followed what he's doing blueprint? Yeah, it's very fascinating [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2541.54s)]
*  I mean, he's just basically measuring and tracking every single thing [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2544.9s)]
*  He can possibly think of and then seeing the effects of various changes in his lifestyle [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2548.46s)]
*  diet supplements behaviors and how those impact his his biology and I I would give him credit because he's [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2553.7s)]
*  Basically taken one for the team [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2561.54s)]
*  He's like I want to be a human experiment and I want to see how far I can push this and how [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2563.22s)]
*  long I can live and and basically [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2568.58s)]
*  Do do science a favor by spending my own millions of dollars [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2572.3799999999997s)]
*  With an end-of-one experiment on myself and I think I think we're gonna learn a lot from that [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2577.54s)]
*  I I do think it makes for a pretty dull guy to be around [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2581.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean his last meal is 11 o'clock at night and the morning. I mean [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2585.06s)]
*  he goes to bed at 8 o'clock at night and I'm like [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2589.46s)]
*  Okay, and you know, he says well, sometimes I break out and I'm kind of you know [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2593.4199999999996s)]
*  Just don't want to be socially kind of weird [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2597.18s)]
*  So I'll I'll go out to dinner and I'll eat some steamed vegetables and I'm like, well, okay [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2599.06s)]
*  I don't know that doesn't check [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2603.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's a [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2605.66s)]
*  It's like I can't have anybody sleeping better than me, you know, I can't I can't have be in a relationship [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2607.7799999999997s)]
*  I can't like, you know, it's like well, those are things that are really important, you know [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2611.98s)]
*  If you're in a relationship and you have good social connections [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2616.54s)]
*  It's probably one of the things that impacts longevity the most so I wouldn't miss on that one [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2620.34s)]
*  You know he one of the things he's famously done is [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2625.66s)]
*  received transfusions from his son and [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2629.42s)]
*  Offered transfusions, you know the whole young blood experiment work out there [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2633.3s)]
*  thoughts on that well, this is really, you know kind of [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2638.94s)]
*  Extrapolation of research that was done on mice called parabiosis where they basically wired up the old mice and young mice [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2643.26s)]
*  Circulation to see what would happen and they found that the old mice became young [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2650.2200000000003s)]
*  Now they weren't sure young mice became old old right as they weren't sure what it was [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2656.0600000000004s)]
*  So they actually followed up on some of these studies and they they actually did a plasma exchange where they basically [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2660.38s)]
*  Did a filtering of the old mouse blood? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2666.1400000000003s)]
*  So instead of just getting young well [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2669.8399999999997s)]
*  They just took out all the old plasma which has all the inflammatory molecules damaged proteins things that you know are kind of accelerating [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2671.56s)]
*  Aging and then just remove them and it had the same benefit. No, this is not [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2677.8799999999997s)]
*  I want to make this very clear the the just [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2682.4399999999996s)]
*  taking out the old plasma and [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2686.48s)]
*  putting in instead [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2689.56s)]
*  albumin and saline which is the you know, the fluid segment of the plasma had the rejuvenant effect [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2691.6s)]
*  of a plasma exchange [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2699.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2701.56s)]
*  It's fascinating and then they've done some interesting studies like that that are on humans and Alzheimer's patients and seeing remarkable results and improvements of their cognition [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2702.9599999999996s)]
*  And activities of daily living and by the way, there's no drug that can do what the plasma does [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2710.16s)]
*  I mean, it's quite it's quite amazing that we're seeing these [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2715.3999999999996s)]
*  Sort of level of results that are in a pretty advanced disease [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2718.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, dr. Ziproff, I guess has the has the protocols there and at fountain. We've just [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2723.24s)]
*  Installed this therapeutic plasma exchange [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2730.0s)]
*  Technology so our members can go and start doing that. Yeah, I've done it you've done it as well [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2733.72s)]
*  How often do you recommend doing it? Well, I don't think we know the frequency yet, but I [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2738.2799999999997s)]
*  Probably would like to do it every quarter. I think there's a sort of a just a tune-up, you know [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2743.72s)]
*  It's like an oil filter change, right? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2747.64s)]
*  And I actually one time I did it, you know [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2749.52s)]
*  If you feel good, you know, I say if you don't have a headache and aspirin doesn't do much [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2752.04s)]
*  So, you know might might do something sub clinically or sub sub perceptually, but it's not gonna affect you, right? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2755.2799999999997s)]
*  So I've had plasma exchange when I feel fine [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2761.52s)]
*  I definitely feel a boost of energy and well-being and you know more subjective things [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2763.52s)]
*  but once I had kovat and I was really sick and I and I [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2768.24s)]
*  It was the worst kovat I'd had I had like three times and I and I developed arthritis after my hands swole swelled up [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2772.0s)]
*  I had severe fatigue. I was just really [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2778.7599999999998s)]
*  Incapacitated and I was worried, you know, and I ended up going having plasma free sis and [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2781.1600000000003s)]
*  Literally within hours my swelling went away in my hand my joints became normal the next morning [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2787.4s)]
*  I felt like a million bucks and I was like, wow, there's something to this, you know, cuz we use it in medicine already [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2792.0800000000004s)]
*  We use it for people with autoimmune diseases with inflammatory diseases when there are logic diseases with Gideon-Barré syndrome with vaccine injury [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2797.6400000000003s)]
*  So it's used a lot for people who have and by the way [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2804.6000000000004s)]
*  People with COVID vaccine injury and I'm sending for plasma recess and they do remarkably well [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2808.12s)]
*  So it takes out all the inflammatory gut basically in your system [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2812.16s)]
*  How does that's a medical word right Peter got? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2816.48s)]
*  So a lot of people have [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2823.44s)]
*  desired [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2827.2799999999997s)]
*  To go get stem cells after reading life force and of course in the United States [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2829.04s)]
*  Stem cell from placental stem cells or cord stem cells [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2834.12s)]
*  Allogenic from somebody else or is not legal today [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2839.0s)]
*  And what you need to do is get you can get stem cells from your own bone marrow your own fat and you can [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2842.8399999999997s)]
*  Concentrate them and give them back to yourself [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2849.3999999999996s)]
*  And or you can go down to [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2852.6s)]
*  Costa Rica [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2856.12s)]
*  RMI is down there or [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2858.12s)]
*  You know Mexico [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2860.64s)]
*  There's a number of different locations south of the border. You can go and get I get stem cells [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2862.6s)]
*  What's your thinking today on stem cells? Well full disclosure. I'm going down in nine days tower am I? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2867.72s)]
*  For a fall stem cell treatment. So what I'm doing is IV stem cells [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2873.4s)]
*  I'm doing orthopedic stem cells in my back and my knee [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2877.96s)]
*  I I jumped off a golf cart trying to save my girlfriend [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2881.68s)]
*  She fell off and banged her head and I twisted my knee and got a little meniscal thing. I'm doing my knee [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2884.02s)]
*  I'm gonna do the sexual enhancement one because I'm 64. Why not and [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2888.48s)]
*  The skin rejuvenation and so just do the whole thing and I'll give you a report afterwards, but I've done [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2892.6s)]
*  Systemic stem cells, I think three times [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2898.48s)]
*  I've done once in my knee for a knee injury and and I found it incredibly helpful. I [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2901.3199999999997s)]
*  Think felt a visceral change. I did functional change. Yeah, I definitely felt overall more energy more clarity [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2907.52s)]
*  Improvement overall, you know fitness. So I did I did notice certain things now. They're subjective [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2914.92s)]
*  I didn't have any objective metrics and I'm going to do this again [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2921.04s)]
*  I'm gonna recheck my biological age after so I've been tracking it and I'm getting some biomarkers down before and after though [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2924.6s)]
*  I'm curious about it. I think you know, we definitely more data. I'm like you Peter [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2930.2s)]
*  I am definitely on the bleeding edge of things and I wouldn't recommend the things that I'm doing to myself to my patients sometimes [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2935.52s)]
*  But I'm willing to take one for the team chief get chief guinea pig. Yeah. Yeah, so I think I study it [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2941.72s)]
*  I think about it and it sounds their scientific basis if the risks are low and the something that's a I can afford [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2948.2s)]
*  I'll do it and and and and that's kind of how I play the game [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2954.7599999999998s)]
*  but I think it's really about your risk tolerance and and I think what we need is a large infusion of capital into a [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2958.48s)]
*  research and clinical trials using stem cells from everything from [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2966.8399999999997s)]
*  you know longevity to [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2970.72s)]
*  autoimmune diseases to [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2973.6s)]
*  You know orthopedic issues, I mean we just we just have so many applications for these and I think we're unfortunately just so behind on this [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2975.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's it is unfortunate. It's not [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2982.88s)]
*  Something that the FDA has the proper guidelines to regulate yet [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2986.44s)]
*  And so it is sort of just kept in the don't do it category [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2990.36s)]
*  We are standing up at fountain under a investigation new drug protocol [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=2996.16s)]
*  Placental derived stem cells the other area that we're standing up with our sister company [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3001.6000000000004s)]
*  Celularity that Bob who is my dear friend is natural killer cell supplementation [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3007.96s)]
*  So and people should know your natural killer cells are your innate immune system that detects cancer [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3014.7200000000003s)]
*  Detects senile cells detects infected cells and as we age [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3021.88s)]
*  They're like your body's Pac-Man [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3027.48s)]
*  And yeah, exactly exactly [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3029.48s)]
*  As we age our immune system goes becomes, you know dysfunctional [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3032.64s)]
*  dysregulated and so [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3037.92s)]
*  The results we've seen early on with natural killer cells [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3040.12s)]
*  Where you can give it as a exotic from an exogenous source placental derived source [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3044.76s)]
*  Looks super promising. So I think that's going to be another IND where we give people [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3051.04s)]
*  Natural killer cells to help [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3057.1200000000003s)]
*  address [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3059.84s)]
*  Building up of senescent cells in the body. Yeah, I've done that too. I've done it actually for my own cells [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3060.84s)]
*  I dropped 20 miles of blood sent into a lab that was cultured had to go to a different country to do it [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3066.36s)]
*  But but basically I did the infusion of my own natural killer cells as well [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3072.6000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, I think it's hard to kind of say what these things do and and again, this is sort of experimental [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3076.6400000000003s)]
*  But I think that these things are all all things that need to be more rigorously studied and there is there is data [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3082.2799999999997s)]
*  It's just it's just slow and plotting and I think we need to put capital into this because it can it can help people with [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3088.68s)]
*  So many different conditions. Hey everyone [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3094.4399999999996s)]
*  I want to take a quick break from this episode to tell you about a health product that I love and that I use every day [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3096.52s)]
*  In fact, I use it twice a day. It's seeds DSO one daily symbiotic [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3102.72s)]
*  Hopefully by now you understand that your microbiome and your gut health are one of the most important [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3108.96s)]
*  Modifiable parts of your health, you know your gut microbiome is connected to everything your brain health your cardiac health your metabolic health [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3114.12s)]
*  So the question is what are you doing to optimize your gut? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3121.04s)]
*  Let me take a moment to tell you about what I'm doing every day. I take two capsules of seeds DSO one daily symbiotic [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3124.28s)]
*  It's a two-in-one probiotic and prebiotic formulation that supports digestive and heart disease [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3131.52s)]
*  Digested health gut health skin health heart health and more it contains 24 clinically and scientifically proven [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3138.08s)]
*  Probiotic strains that are delivered in a patented capsule that actually protects the contents from your stomach acid and [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3145.28s)]
*  Ensures that a hundred percent of it is survivable reaching your colon now [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3152.76s)]
*  If you want to try seeds DSO one daily symbiotic for yourself [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3156.92s)]
*  You can get 25% off your first month supply by using the code Peter 25 at checkout [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3160.84s)]
*  Just go to seed comm slash moonshots and enter the code Peter 25 at checkout [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3167.34s)]
*  That's seed comm slash moonshots and use the code Peter 25 to get your 25% off [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3173.1400000000003s)]
*  The first month of seeds daily symbiotic. Trust me your gut will thank you. Alright, let's go back to the episode [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3180.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean sarcopenia is one, you know, whenever I have a venture fund bold capital [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3187.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm actually in their offices right now and [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3192.2000000000003s)]
*  I tell people if you've got a [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3194.3999999999996s)]
*  We're now probably two-thirds biotech health tech. I say if you've got a a [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3197.64s)]
*  Company that addresses sarcopenia. I want to hear about it, right? I think it's one of the biggest [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3203.96s)]
*  Challenges we have the loss of functional [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3209.16s)]
*  Muscle tissue and muscle strength as we as we grow old [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3212.2799999999997s)]
*  You know the numbers even better than I if you if you fall and fracture your hip [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3217.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a damn good chance you're not going to make it out of the hospital [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3223.44s)]
*  And so, you know having the ability to regain or maintain muscle mass in your 70s 80s 90s is super critical [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3227.44s)]
*  What do you do what do you think about besides a CRISPR gene edit [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3237.68s)]
*  What what do you recommend for somebody? What's your protocol for maintaining and growing muscle mass? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3243.64s)]
*  Well, you know, I think I've doubled down on as I've got older and and essentially I focused on a regular [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3250.0s)]
*  A strength training routine three or four sometimes five times a week with bands and weights if I have them available. I then [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3257.52s)]
*  Focus on my protein intake, which is a basically a gram of protein per pound for me [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3265.2000000000003s)]
*  That's about a hundred and seventy five to hundred eighty grams. So that's what I do as well [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3270.6s)]
*  Yeah [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3274.28s)]
*  And then I make sure that I and this is really important understand from people is that you know people like intermittent fasting [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3274.6s)]
*  Well, okay, you probably should not eat for 12 hours between dinner and breakfast. That's just called breakfast [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3280.96s)]
*  You can eat breakfast at six it's not exactly fasting right if you dinner at eight you need breakfast at eight [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3290.0s)]
*  Maybe 14 hours, but when you when you're fasted [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3296.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's important I think to do at least a 12-hour overnight fast the first meal really matters because it's not just the fasting [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3300.96s)]
*  That it's important that induces [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3308.2799999999997s)]
*  Activation of mTOR or inhibition of mTOR and [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3311.64s)]
*  autophagy or [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3315.2s)]
*  Self-cleaning like your self-cleaning oven. It's the first meal that you have after you do that. That's critical because that first meal [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3316.8399999999997s)]
*  Determines what happens next and what happens next if you do it, right meaning right being having 40 to 50 grams of protein [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3325.72s)]
*  When you do that then it activates mTOR but also does it in a way that synthesizes muscle protein or muscle protein synthesis and [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3333.08s)]
*  It activates your stem cells. It activates all these longevity pathways. So it's it's got a sort of kind of a dual benefit [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3341.56s)]
*  So it's it's both the feeding fasting and the feeding that matter and the feeding and what's your breakfast? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3348.48s)]
*  So for example this morning, I woke up early. I was kind of up early [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3353.96s)]
*  I did some meditation and wrote my journal for a bit [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3357.92s)]
*  Then I went for about an hour and a half hike up mountain behind my house came back did a 30 minute rigorous band workout [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3361.04s)]
*  Did some stretching and then you know took a quick steam and an ice bath and then I had my my shake and my [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3368.8s)]
*  My I caught my healthy aging shake. I'm happy to give you the recipe [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3375.28s)]
*  You can it's in my book actually the young forever and you can you can check it out [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3378.1200000000003s)]
*  But essentially I take goat whey and whey protein is is more well tolerated by my most people [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3381.7799999999997s)]
*  Some of the dairy is a little hard. It's regenerative raised go away and [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3388.3399999999997s)]
*  It's about 40 50 grams. I put in mito pure, which is your lythene [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3392.58s)]
*  I use my to pure as well [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3398.02s)]
*  Yeah, I use a thousand milligrams and your lythene a the date on is really impressive it in [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3399.1s)]
*  induces mitochondrial synthesis [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3404.2599999999998s)]
*  mitochondria biogenesis induces mitophagy improves [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3406.66s)]
*  Reduces sarcopenia and improves muscle synthesis as well as also reducing inflammation and many many other really impressive things [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3410.82s)]
*  I also add in five grams of creatine to help muscle building and I put a bunch of other stuff in there [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3419.38s)]
*  Which which is an essay for muscle building, but I'll put in adaptogenic mushrooms. I'll put in [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3427.06s)]
*  My gut food product which sent she has pre and probiotics and polyphenols [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3432.9s)]
*  What else I put in there? I? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3437.06s)]
*  Sometimes put in other other immunoglobulins for my gut and gut healing [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3439.2999999999997s)]
*  Probiotics and so is that that's kind of my morning shake and I'll put in some almond milk or or maybe [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3443.2599999999998s)]
*  Macadamia milk and some frozen berries and that's basically my shake and I don't have it so it's not sweetened [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3448.98s)]
*  It doesn't have any sugar and and the berries give it a nice flavor and make it like like a milkshake [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3453.7799999999997s)]
*  Love it. That is so close to I do do you I I've enjoyed cochabas well as a [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3459.46s)]
*  As a protein drink yeah, the thing the thing that's important is make sure you know plant-based proteins can be great [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3465.74s)]
*  But you have to make sure that they're they're they're they're the right [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3472.46s)]
*  Basia of amino acids and and as you get older [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3477.3799999999997s)]
*  You get anabolic resistance meaning it's harder to build muscle and the great limiting amino acid for activating mTOR [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3481.5s)]
*  Which builds muscle is leucine so if you don't have two and a half grams of leucine in a serving of protein that you're having [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3488.06s)]
*  You're not actually switching on the the switch to build the muscle so you can add [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3493.7s)]
*  leucine you can add you know [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3498.98s)]
*  You can actually add a scoop of branched-chain amino acids or you can take something called amino acid complex by Thorne [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3500.58s)]
*  I don't have any relation with them or any [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3506.1s)]
*  Financial thing with them at all [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3508.82s)]
*  But but this has been well studied was actually a product that they bought from a European company that was used to treat sarcopenia [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3510.34s)]
*  An elderly and it's basically an amino acid complex that has high levels of leucine so you can throw it on your shake if you want [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3517.1s)]
*  But I would be careful to make sure you look at the amino acid [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3524.42s)]
*  Composition and at least has a two and a half grams and and goat whey versus versus grass-fed beef [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3528.02s)]
*  Well, you know if you have you know the thing is if it's grass-fed grass-finished, okay? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3533.7400000000002s)]
*  That's fine, but what kind of cow is it is an a2 cow or is an a1 cow so a2 casein is less inflammatory [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3539.94s)]
*  It's like Gersey Guernsey and Jersey cows and other heirloom cows or as most cows in America are Holstein cows [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3546.26s)]
*  They're all a1 casein which is super inflammatory [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3551.6800000000003s)]
*  It's a lot of risk issues that I'm concerned about and most way doesn't have that much casein [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3554.38s)]
*  But I'll have a little and I think I notice for example when I have because I'm sensitive to dairy [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3559.2200000000003s)]
*  It's one of the foods that I just sense there too if I have I do not I do not eat dairy [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3564.5800000000004s)]
*  If I if I have like whey protein like somewhere I'll be somewhere. I just want to think I'll have a whey protein [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3568.86s)]
*  Almost my nose gets all congested and I have I'm flemming and if I do a podcast is terrible [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3574.68s)]
*  But but but if I have the goat whey, I don't have any of that [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3580.36s)]
*  So I know there's something going on where it's triggering some immune inflammatory response when I have regular regular whey you said [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3583.68s)]
*  You know 12 hours you should you should fast these 12 hours [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3590.6s)]
*  I am curious your views on intermittent fasting because you know [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3593.64s)]
*  It was you know, there's so much [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3599.68s)]
*  Conversation around you know 18 hours off, you know six hours on [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3602.2s)]
*  You know 20 hours off four hours on and you know, I was reading that the studies [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3607.68s)]
*  Actually don't show that that makes a difference and what really matters is your total caloric intake [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3614.7999999999997s)]
*  Sure, can you speak to that? Yeah for sure [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3620.64s)]
*  Well, it does give you a little bit time more for autophagy and I think I think having at least 12 hours is minimum [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3623.3599999999997s)]
*  That's not really a fast it's just normal [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3629.88s)]
*  You shouldn't eat before bed and you can eat when you wake up [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3633.56s)]
*  It's basically America. We just keep eating until we have dinner then we have your dinner snacks [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3636.6000000000004s)]
*  Then we have a snack before bed. We have a second dinner. That's that's just terrible for you. It's really bad [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3641.1200000000003s)]
*  It'll make you gain weight. Basically, it's I call the sumo wrestler diet is what I wrote about in one of my first books called ultra [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3646.56s)]
*  Metabolism, how do the sumo wrestlers gain so much weight? They're normal little Japanese guys [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3651.84s)]
*  Well, they they basically feed him an enormous calorie dense food and then they make him go take a nap and then they wake [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3656.6s)]
*  Them up and they do exercise and they have another huge meal and then they take another nap [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3662.68s)]
*  So basically then they go to sleep. So it's basically you eat on full stomach is the way they gain weight [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3667.3999999999996s)]
*  But I think in term intermittent fasting can be challenging because if you do it you can lose muscle and then you end up [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3673.3999999999996s)]
*  You know in the kind of a counterproductive system [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3679.8399999999997s)]
*  I think it's really individual if you're very overweight and you want to use it as a strategy to drop a bunch of weight [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3682.56s)]
*  I think it's great. I think if you're for someone like, you know, you and I who are mostly metabolically optimized I [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3687.56s)]
*  Think extended extended fasting [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3693.68s)]
*  Probably is not a great idea [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3696.16s)]
*  I mean because the reason I the reason I stopped as well is because I'm trying to [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3697.92s)]
*  You can't load all of your protein at one sitting [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3702.36s)]
*  Your body is not going to absorb it. It's not going to absorb it. It's not going to absorb it [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3706.72s)]
*  Your body is not going to absorb it. And so I like to spread, you know my 150 grams [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3710.64s)]
*  Including a you know a breakfast when I because I work out first thing in the morning [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3717.3199999999997s)]
*  So it helps me make sure I get protein breakfast lunch and dinner [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3721.12s)]
*  I'm curious total calories. What's your view on caloric intake? I think it's really important [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3727.04s)]
*  I think you know, we we excess calories are not good and and I'm sure you suggest a person [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3732.72s)]
*  How much it depends right so it depends on your metabolic engine, right? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3738.2799999999997s)]
*  If you're someone who's been on a Zempic and you've lost all this muscle and you're you know, 180 pounds like me [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3742.3599999999997s)]
*  You're probably gonna need far less calories than I do because you know, my view to max is high. I have high muscle mass [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3748.96s)]
*  I very low body fat. So I need a lot of calories. I need like [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3755.0s)]
*  almost 3,000 calories a day, but but if if you [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3759.16s)]
*  Are someone who's not as active if you're someone who's [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3763.7599999999998s)]
*  You know not metabolically tuned up then you may need less calories [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3767.68s)]
*  So it really depends on your body type and you can do measurements of your basal metabolic rate [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3772.3599999999997s)]
*  With various kinds of devices now you can do it in a lab now where they measure oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3778.6s)]
*  We used to do that when I worked at Canyon Ranch and you can see you know, it's usually basically [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3784.24s)]
*  the way to figure it out is is [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3788.7599999999998s)]
*  ten times [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3791.2799999999997s)]
*  Your body weight in calories, so if you're 180 pounds like me my basal metabolic rate is [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3793.36s)]
*  1800 calories and then for your activities of daily living you usually add on [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3799.8s)]
*  Another 30% right so 30% on top of that would be like [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3804.5600000000004s)]
*  2,400 calories [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3809.4s)]
*  So that's basically my basic needs now if I'm like going for a five [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3810.8s)]
*  hour bike ride [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3816.0s)]
*  I'm climbing up the Everest Base Camp where I was you know, like like I did this summer and was hiking [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3817.52s)]
*  You know ten miles and fourteen thousand feet straight up. I might need more [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3823.36s)]
*  So it depends on what you're doing, but that's basically kind of how you figure it out and by the way [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3827.04s)]
*  Calories as a way of thinking about looking at your food just is kind of a hopeless endeavor if you take the top [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3833.76s)]
*  Nutritional scientists who study calories and you tell them [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3841.66s)]
*  Okay [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3845.38s)]
*  I want you to determine the calorie count of the food you ate without actually like measuring it and weighing it and everything [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3845.64s)]
*  They won't be able to do it and and if you're off by a hundred calories a day [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3852.1s)]
*  Like just a hundred calories a day, which is not very much. It's got bite of food [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3857.08s)]
*  You're gonna gain like 20 pounds in a year [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3861.5s)]
*  So, you know what you have to understand is it's really about regulating your metabolic [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3864.66s)]
*  System so that your brain chemistry your hormones and your metabolism are all working in [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3871.2999999999997s)]
*  Synergy so that you're going to self regulate and do it in a way that is your body is smart [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3876.82s)]
*  And knows what to do because if you try to count calories, it's kind of forget it [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3882.34s)]
*  You know a question from from my my Twitter audience here is is what real-time metrics [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3885.94s)]
*  Do you look at to track longevity and you know, it's interesting. I wish there were good metrics. I mean, you know [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3891.1s)]
*  true age [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3898.7799999999997s)]
*  As a as a you know your methylation clock [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3900.22s)]
*  interesting [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3903.54s)]
*  And since it's the only real thing I think there is out there [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3904.74s)]
*  I measure that but I measure percent, but you know [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3908.4199999999996s)]
*  Fat and and muscle mass and things like that. What do you measure? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3912.74s)]
*  well [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3916.06s)]
*  there's the more to think of like what are the risk factors and then what are the what are the actual measurements of biological age and [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3916.8199999999997s)]
*  I'll send you a paper after we get off that kind of looks at all the different biological age clocks and there's a number [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3923.2599999999998s)]
*  And there's a number of inferential ones for example more in leaving is you know used a number of different [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3928.54s)]
*  epigenetic markers than for example the Horvath Horvath clock [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3934.3s)]
*  Which is more or less what's used for true age and and what they vary minute to minute day to day in the same person [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3937.4s)]
*  They can vary decade to decade by different tests even with the same person and the same time. So [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3943.54s)]
*  She's she's calculated based on some simple blood biomarkers whether it's albumin [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3950.7s)]
*  You know red cell distribution of width CRP glucose [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3956.3s)]
*  Alkfoss which a lot of markers that don't exactly make sense to me for biological age, but apparently it pretty reliably [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3960.42s)]
*  calculated to correlate with a lot of the epigenetic marks [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3968.14s)]
*  So it's sort of a it's sort of an you know uses large data sets to come up with [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3971.06s)]
*  Kind of a surrogate way of measuring these epigenetic marks using regular blood tests, and I think it's interesting [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3977.7s)]
*  But the question is [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3984.94s)]
*  What do you do with those? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3987.02s)]
*  Well, you have to you find one and or you can use multiple and then change your lifestyle or habits or supplements and then check [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3987.98s)]
*  It again as a way of sort of being your own control [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3995.1s)]
*  But but the real the real things I look at are blood biomarkers [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=3997.98s)]
*  Imaging biomarkers to see what's really going on in the body and and from a functional medicine perspective [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=4001.74s)]
*  I'm actually giving a talk on Friday at the Buck Institute of Aging on [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=4006.94s)]
*  Longevity diagnostics and it's really but one of the things we should be looking at and from a functional medicine perspective [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=4011.02s)]
*  I think about how do we assess health not just what we're looking for disease and I do that too [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=4016.38s)]
*  But but I do the gallery screen to look for cancer biomarkers and liquid biopsy or I'll do the clearly heart scan to look at [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=4021.46s)]
*  atherosclerotic plaque whether soft or hard plaque or and that that's all looking for actual disease, but I'm also looking for [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEmaCSkFA6I&t=4028.94s)]
