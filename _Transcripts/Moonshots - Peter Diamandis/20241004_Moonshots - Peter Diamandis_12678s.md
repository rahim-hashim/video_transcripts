# How a $10M Bet Made Civilian Spaceflight a Reality w/ Anousheh A, Gregg M, and Erik L | EP #122
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64)
*  Some things happen right when you get this idea from the universe and I said [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=0.0s)]
*  that's it because I've been so frustrated with space that okay I'm gonna [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5.36s)]
*  do a prize for spaceflight. I remember people saying that you guys are crazy [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=12.16s)]
*  because you're gonna get people killed. The idea of spaceflight, of commercial [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=16.56s)]
*  spaceflight and human spaceflight was insane. We wanted to get a totally [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=21.64s)]
*  different style of operations than the people that were doing government funded [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=26.68s)]
*  space programs. It would be Monday and we would have $50,000 due on Friday and if [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=30.92s)]
*  we didn't pay it the whole thing was over. The X-Prize has launched nearly [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=37.92s)]
*  $600 million in competitions, has driven billion dollars in R&D. We've now sort of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=41.56s)]
*  taken two whole industries, the aerospace industry and the incentive [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=47.6s)]
*  prize industry, to a new level. There are things that people believe are impossible [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=52.04s)]
*  but it's because they have a wrong assumption someplace and our prizes [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=56.28s)]
*  target those wrong assumptions. This is not an overnight success. This is an [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=60.68s)]
*  overnight success after 30 years of hard work. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Peter Diamandis here. Welcome to Moonshots. Today is a special episode. It's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=70.92s)]
*  probably gonna be a long one so buckle in. It's a story of human spirit. It's a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=75.84s)]
*  story of dreaming big. Hopefully at the end of this conversation you're gonna be [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=80.92s)]
*  inspired to do something extraordinary in your own life and to pull together a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=84.92s)]
*  band of rebels who are gonna transform something that you think is important. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  This happens to be the 30th year anniversary of the X-Prize. We've [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=92.92s)]
*  launched 30 prizes over 30 years. Extraordinary. Hard for me to believe [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  that. We've driven about $600 million of incentive competitions, driving billions [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=101.32s)]
*  in R&D and while it's been an amazing story, it has a history that after you [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=106.84s)]
*  hear it, it's an improbability that we exist today. You're gonna be hearing from [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=114.12s)]
*  three individuals. Greg Marinak who I'll introduce in a moment, Eric Lindbergh, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=119.0s)]
*  grandson of Charles Lindbergh and Anushan Sarri who funded the first ten million [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  dollar X-Prize who is now the CEO of the X-Prize Foundation. At the end of the day [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=128.72s)]
*  if we look back most people and still today believe that we're in a world of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  great crisis where there's few resources that we are running out of resources on [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  this planet but the belief of myself and the folks you're about to meet is that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=146.32s)]
*  the greatest resource humanity needs is that of the committed and passionate [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  human mind. That dreaming big and putting muscle behind those dreams can slay any [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  grand challenge. So settle back, get ready to be inspired. This is the story of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=165.48s)]
*  opening up civilian spaceflight, of opening up the space frontier for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=171.76s)]
*  everybody because it wasn't always that way. Let's begin. Greg Marinak, hey buddy [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=176.16s)]
*  good to see you. We're here today. Hi Peter, I'm in ex-urban St. Louis, Missouri, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  the ancestral home of the X-Prize Foundation. Well for those who don't know [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  Greg, Greg first of all to put context here, Greg is one of my oldest and dearest [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=192.68s)]
*  friends. We go back in now 40-50 years, no well got 40 years in terms of working [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=197.32s)]
*  together in space. Greg gave me the original Spirit of St. Louis book and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=205.96s)]
*  will tell that story that got the X-Prize Foundation started and I think [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=211.08s)]
*  Greg it's fair to say that you sacrifice so much in your life for this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=217.32s)]
*  dream and I want to say thank you for all of that. Let's kick it off. I mean you [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=222.16s)]
*  know today in 2024 people are used to seeing Falcon 9 launching people to the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  space station, Starship is flying, Bezos is flying and when you think about you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=233.84s)]
*  know human spaceflight you think commercial companies but it wasn't [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=239.6s)]
*  always that way. You want to set some context of why the heck did we start [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=243.68s)]
*  this X-Prize and originally X-Prize was just about opening the space frontier [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  and it was considered an insane idea back then. Let's let's jump back in our [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=253.52s)]
*  time machine here. Yeah so if we go back in our time machine Peter, we even go [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=259.72s)]
*  back a little further than the question of government or commercial in space. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=265.52s)]
*  It's like why do we want to care about space and one of the things we've [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=269.12s)]
*  learned from X-Prize over these last 30 years is that there are things that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=274.84s)]
*  people believe are impossible but it's because they have a wrong assumption [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=280.96s)]
*  someplace and our prizes target those wrong assumptions. Well the assumption [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=284.67999999999995s)]
*  that people had in the in the 70s and 80s was that and and mostly still have [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=289.44s)]
*  today is that the earth is somehow divorced from the ocean of space that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  surrounds us and you and I got into this business because we wanted to give [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=300.24s)]
*  humanity the best chance of success and and use the resources in the ocean of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=306.6s)]
*  space to save our island earth but what we discovered through through years of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=314.28s)]
*  working this problem and literally years you and I worked on this this was not [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=321.04s)]
*  our first rodeo X-Prize it was probably about our fifth rodeo. We discovered [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=325.72s)]
*  that there was a another fundamental assumption that people were making that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=331.6s)]
*  was holding us back and that was the assumption that only governments could [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=336.16s)]
*  do spaceflight and Peter you you sacrificed as much as I did or more but [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=339.32000000000005s)]
*  you know one of the things you were doing back when we started was you were [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=344.48s)]
*  running our little small launch vehicle company International Microspace we were [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  going to launch we had a perfect business plan we were going to launch 10 [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=355.34s)]
*  pound satellites for non-governmental customers at a cost of about seven [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=357.34s)]
*  hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It was almost flawless there were two small [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  problems with that there were no non-governmental customers and there [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=366.5s)]
*  were no 10 pound satellites then now they are abundant but but we found out [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=369.58s)]
*  right away every single business meeting wasn't that NASA's job why isn't [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=375.26s)]
*  government doing it if it's worth doing how come NASA's not doing it you know [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=379.14s)]
*  NASA is a victim of its own marvelous success of the 60s. You know when you [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=382.14s)]
*  and I when you and I met Greg you were running the Space Studies Institute out [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=386.18s)]
*  of Princeton New Jersey working with Gerard K O'Neill you were president [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=389.41999999999996s)]
*  there and you know it was a time when there was a very small group of I almost [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=394.14s)]
*  feel it was like religious believers that space was in our destiny you know I [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=401.09999999999997s)]
*  think we had all drunk the Kool-Aid from you know Star Trek and and great [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=406.85999999999996s)]
*  authors like Heinlein and the idea that after I mean for me what was really what [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=412.17999999999995s)]
*  was really shaking things up was that the space shuttle program was so damn [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=419.02s)]
*  expensive and it was flying so infrequently and this was not my vision [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=423.14s)]
*  of spaceflight and and Gerard K O'Neill came in with a very different vision and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=427.34s)]
*  I think it's important for people to know that you know Jeff Bezos today [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=433.18s)]
*  really has taken the mantle Jeff was at Princeton University as an undergrad and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=435.94s)]
*  he was in fact the president of the SEDS chapter right and you and I met first [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=441.62s)]
*  met through SEDS through Todd Hawley who was my co-founder with Bob Richards [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=445.1s)]
*  there and and and Bezos his vision different from Musk his you know Elon's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  vision is let's go to Mars let's go into another planetary gravitational [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=458.21999999999997s)]
*  well and and and Jeff's vision I think because of the work done at space [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=462.74s)]
*  studies and by dr. O'Neill was let's go mine the moon and the asteroids and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=469.54s)]
*  create large O'Neill colonies and make humanity not dependent on planetary [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=474.58s)]
*  systems yeah and also bring power down from space 24-7 for cities and megacities [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=479.66s)]
*  and industry basically use space to save the earth and Bezos read the same book [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=486.02s)]
*  that I read I was in law school when I read it the high frontier and it cost me [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=491.36s)]
*  my life and Bezos read it and cost him a billion dollars a year now mean in what [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=496.0s)]
*  he's personally funding fascinating right you were you were a lawyer at the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=500.88s)]
*  time it's people don't know you as a lawyer because you're so brilliant as [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  an educator and a space you know a space visionary but you were doing law at the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=507.92s)]
*  time and that changed the course of your life yeah I met O'Neill and my wife and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=515.32s)]
*  my fiance and I started the Chicago Society for Space Studies in 1977 when [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  dinosaurs still roam the earth and we invited dr. O'Neill to give a big public [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=526.04s)]
*  speech lecture at Navy Pier in Chicago which he did in 78 when I should have [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=532.3399999999999s)]
*  been studying for the bar exam I was working this giant event and I met Jerry [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=539.52s)]
*  and he invited me to become a director and and eventually he hoodwinked me into [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=544.76s)]
*  not hoodwinked me but he said he persuaded me to move to Princeton I joke [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=548.96s)]
*  Peter has heard so many times that my wife says that that O'Neill got me with [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=554.48s)]
*  a commercial pitch that was join the space business you could earn as much as [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=559.52s)]
*  some poets and sadly it was true and people think about space now is a [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=563.96s)]
*  billionaire's game and such and there was no commercial spaceflight back then [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  it was all governmental programs what was what was Jerry's vision of space [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=574.6s)]
*  that was so compelling I know it I know what it was for me but I'd like to hear [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=578.9200000000001s)]
*  yours well for me it was the the notion that that we could actually use space [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=583.32s)]
*  not just to look at the problems that the earth was facing but to change and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=588.88s)]
*  you know that there's more context you remember the mood when when we got into [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=593.44s)]
*  the space business Peter some of the big books that were very popular in fact [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=597.52s)]
*  this is little before that was the population bomb by Paul Ehrlich the cover [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=601.24s)]
*  which said in the time it takes to read the cover of this book four people have [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=605.6s)]
*  died three of them children from starvation real cheery book Ehrlich was [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=608.8s)]
*  completely wrong by the way and paradoxically his student his grad [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=612.84s)]
*  student is Stuart Brand who thinks a lot like you do and I Peter but he was wrong [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=617.4s)]
*  and another book that was popular and still is popular is called limits to [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=623.0s)]
*  growth and it says in a limited world your children will have less than you [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=627.84s)]
*  their children will have less than them but those books were based on a [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  fundamentally flawed assumption that the world is a closed system when they the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=636.48s)]
*  earth and it's not we get all our energy from space already and so O'Neill's [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=641.88s)]
*  vision was really compelling because it was in such strong counterpoint and and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=648.12s)]
*  it really was based on something that you just said which is that O'Neill asked [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=654.6s)]
*  his students as a professor of physics at Princeton what's the best place for a [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=659.64s)]
*  future future expanding technological civilization is it is it the earth is it [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=665.0s)]
*  is it the moon or some other planet or is it something entirely different and [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=669.4s)]
*  the answer came back something entirely different be in free space if you get [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=673.24s)]
*  out of your gravity well don't go down into another one unless Hawaii's at the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  bottom and we got the only planet with Hawaii at the bottom so there's so it's [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=681.84s)]
*  very it is a very different vision from the vision of people like Elon you know [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=686.6s)]
*  he's sincere he got imprinted with the old NASA 1950s party line and he believes [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  it but but this is this is a different view of of space to paint a little bit [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=699.72s)]
*  of the the vision that O'Neill had and to move us to move us forward you know [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=705.92s)]
*  Jerry O'Neill believed that we could go to the surface of the moon and mine [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=714.16s)]
*  resources there that the moon has lots of oxygen he didn't know maybe he [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=720.76s)]
*  theorized there was water at the poles which we've now in fact verified but [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=727.7199999999999s)]
*  nickel iron all the building materials are in the lunar regolith and you could [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=732.96s)]
*  actually because of the low gravity mine the moon send the materials out into [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=738.48s)]
*  free space and actually build solar power satellites to create a economic [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=743.4000000000001s)]
*  engine and then very importantly create these large O'Neill colonies can you [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=748.48s)]
*  describe what O'Neill colony looks like because I think that's again what Bezos [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=753.76s)]
*  has is his endpoint vision here yeah when Jerry wrote his first paper in [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=756.6800000000001s)]
*  1974 published in physics today he did a thought experiment he said how big [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=760.68s)]
*  could you build a habitat in in free space if you built it using Brooklyn [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=766.76s)]
*  bridge technology limits steel cable and and stone and the answer was [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=773.56s)]
*  astonishing if you wanted to you could build Switzerland in space a big [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  cylinder that you'd rotate for artificial gravity and you'd let sunlight [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=783.9599999999999s)]
*  in and it's basically it's a hollow shell and you live inside of it it's [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=787.56s)]
*  very much like the membrane of a cell now that I got an older and started to [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=793.28s)]
*  study biology I realized that nature invented this great thing that can allow [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=797.9599999999999s)]
*  life to form or exist in hostile otherwise environment so that's what [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=803.04s)]
*  that's what O'Neill colony is it's like that now later in Jerry's career Jerry [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=807.64s)]
*  was a true entrepreneur he started thinking that maybe this would be a [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=812.8s)]
*  government kind of activity but he realized almost immediately that that [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=816.4s)]
*  NASA would never do it and he said how small could you make these things how [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=820.48s)]
*  small could you make a permanent space habitat that people could live in for [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=825.64s)]
*  long periods of time and and that was really exciting too so that was that was [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=831.0s)]
*  the work that we were doing and Peter you mentioned you know the possibility [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=836.04s)]
*  of water on the moon Jerry wrote a little piece for Omni magazine which is [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=839.16s)]
*  how I got I remember Omni I wonder if anybody else does well you wrote out you [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=842.56s)]
*  wrote a letter to other call up students together that was the formation of says [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=846.4s)]
*  that was from Omni and I saw that look you know but Jerry wrote a little piece [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=850.7199999999999s)]
*  which is sort of a he was good at writing vignettes and it's like what's [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=855.88s)]
*  life like 20 years after we start making space habitats and in it he he said back [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=860.4399999999999s)]
*  in the late 90s a time a small spacecraft discovered ice at the poles [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=865.88s)]
*  of the moon and that he enslaved me when did he write that around 83 or so and I [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=870.64s)]
*  was on I read it on the dot matrix printout prophetic and and I was on the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=876.5600000000001s)]
*  train going to see you and Todd at the SEDS meeting in Washington and it it [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=882.02s)]
*  it wound up taking over the next ten years of my life because I started the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=888.36s)]
*  lunar prospector team at Space Studies Institute that's right designed in the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=891.88s)]
*  probe and then we we hoodwinked at NASA into paying for it Alan Binder was our [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=896.76s)]
*  chief scientist and he wrote the proposal to us Gus DeFiro our friend [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  helped and the result was we found the water ice at the poles of the moon so [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=907.3199999999999s)]
*  that the idea though is that that the you know your friend Arthur Clark Peter [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=911.88s)]
*  had a great graphic from the 1950s which we should throw into this podcast which [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=916.68s)]
*  shows the gravity well of the earth compared to the tiny gravity dimple of [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=922.0s)]
*  the moon 22 times easier to throw something off the moon than from the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=926.12s)]
*  earth it's not to use those little resources on earth it's to use them to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=929.84s)]
*  build stuff in space that can send value to the earth either either new land you [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=934.44s)]
*  know Mark Twain said invest in real estate they're not making any more but [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=939.6s)]
*  we will I want to give people a little bit of a vision of what the O'Neill [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=943.08s)]
*  colony looks like and what you know Bezos has has grabbed on to versus the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=946.96s)]
*  surface of Mars imagine being able to create a large cylinder you know a [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=953.04s)]
*  kilometer in length or thereabouts rotating at you know the equation the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  physics it's a V squared over R or omega squared R to get 1g acceleration on the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=963.7199999999999s)]
*  inside but a million people I think where was his population size if I if I [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=969.36s)]
*  if I don't remember correctly please well the early ones could be that big [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=975.4s)]
*  and and but but they can be just as little ones and be nice in fact Jerry was [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=980.8s)]
*  fond of the little hill towns in Italy what kind of population was he looking [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=987.5999999999999s)]
*  at in like 5,000 in a Bernal sphere but what was interesting I think is that [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=992.3599999999999s)]
*  when you're you've got the gravity and if you move towards the center axis of [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=997.0799999999999s)]
*  rotation you're weightless in the center and as you get older you could move up [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1002.8s)]
*  hills to have you know a half a G at a retirement home but the thing that was [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1007.68s)]
*  interesting today you know if you have a polarization of Republicans and [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1012.48s)]
*  Democrats whatever that whatever you want you fight because you're co located [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1017.64s)]
*  in the future in these O'Neill colonies you could just build a second O'Neill [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1022.72s)]
*  colony and you could literally bud and have you know one population who believe [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1026.92s)]
*  in one religious group or one way of thinking move into one colony and so you [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  could have this kind of constant diversification and growth but it was [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1039.6399999999999s)]
*  this conversation Greg that led us together and I remember just to move this [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1045.6799999999998s)]
*  forward there was a moment in time when it really that crystallized a universe [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1050.76s)]
*  that we're now living in where the X Prize exists so I used to come and hang [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1061.04s)]
*  out with you and because you were my big brother and we had geeky [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1064.48s)]
*  conversations that I couldn't have with anybody else and one day you decided [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1070.64s)]
*  it's time for me to get the joy of flight you want to take us from there [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1075.88s)]
*  yeah I remember that very clearly Peter actually you know you and I love to build [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1081.36s)]
*  things but our day jobs involved a lot of PowerPoint and Excel spreadsheets so [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1085.92s)]
*  we would give ourselves permission once or twice a year to get together and [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1091.8400000000001s)]
*  build some and usually with my my young daughters at the time and you came up [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1095.52s)]
*  and were you were our house guest in Hopewell New Jersey just next to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1100.96s)]
*  Princeton and it was a beautiful October day it was 1991 and we had we had planned [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1104.88s)]
*  to spend the day in the basement building a robot with our my oldest [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1111.76s)]
*  daughter Claire who was eight years old and the weather was so perfect that we [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1115.3999999999999s)]
*  said let's do something outside and I don't remember if it was your idea or [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1120.28s)]
*  mine but we decided to go to Princeton Airport and rent a Cessna 172 and I [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1124.24s)]
*  would fly you up the Hudson River corridor under the controlled airspace [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1129.6s)]
*  in New York City and I remember as we went north look looking over to the [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1134.6s)]
*  right you were in the copilot seat and I could see the Empire State Building [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1139.28s)]
*  behind you and you had a strange expression on your face ear-to-ear grin [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1142.56s)]
*  because that was in the middle of international micro space and you had [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1147.36s)]
*  all that burden on your shoulder and you were having fun and that was a rare [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1151.2s)]
*  thing so instead of turning around at the Tappan Sea Bridge which was my [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1154.8799999999999s)]
*  original plan we flew over Marmarineck and and we flew to Great Neck Long [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1159.08s)]

*  remember when we landed at Princeton Airport you were literally bouncing [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1170.52s)]
*  around on the interior of the plane it was such a blast and you were saying [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1174.44s)]
*  great I'm gonna finish I'm gonna get my license because you had already soloed [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1178.84s)]
*  it back when you were a student at MIT and Harvard but you'd stopped because of [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1182.12s)]
*  your misplaced priorities of going to medical school and such so and you and I [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1186.84s)]
*  remember you know somewhat patronizingly saying yeah Peter that's great you know [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1192.8s)]
*  when you said I'm gonna get my license yeah good Peter you do that but I in my [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1197.0s)]

*  Pennsylvania and in a little bookstore there I saw a dusty copy of Charles [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1213.6799999999998s)]
*  Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize-winning book The Spirit of St. Louis and I had read [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1219.1599999999999s)]
*  it when I was in the first week of high school when I was a freshman and and a [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1223.96s)]
*  year later I was taking flying lessons so I picked the book up blew the dust off [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1233.64s)]
*  it my daughter said dad why are you buying that you have two copies of that [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1237.96s)]
*  at home said I'm buying it for your uncle Peter and you very promptly put it [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1240.92s)]
*  on your bookshelf is here we go but then a couple years later you you you read it [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1247.12s)]
*  and I think you were visiting with your parents someplace what was that yeah so [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1254.52s)]
*  I just want to take a moment and say you know everything I have done since then [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  comes back to this moment in time when Greg gave me this book it changed the [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1265.4799999999998s)]
*  course of my life and you know I think about this when I give a gift of a book [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1271.54s)]
*  to somebody and you never know I did I picked it up again I remember it was [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1276.48s)]
*  December of 1993 I was visiting my parents down in Florida and you know it [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1282.1200000000001s)]
*  was slow Christmas season and so I decided to read the book and it it [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1287.8s)]
*  changed the course of my life I mean so here is a book written by Charles [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1293.6s)]
*  Lindbergh I think he won the Pulitzer Prize with this in like 1954 thereabouts [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1297.52s)]
*  and it tells the story of Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1301.76s)]
*  Ocean I had always assumed I mean everybody's heard of Lindbergh he was the [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1307.76s)]
*  most famous human on the planet at one point I'd always assumed that he just [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1310.96s)]
*  flew on a whim that he woke up one day decided to fly east but it turns out [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1314.84s)]
*  that in 1919 a Frenchman named Raymond Ortague who had come to the US penniless [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1319.48s)]
*  I think around around around 1901 or thereabouts and becomes a hotel busboy [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1327.92s)]
*  and a hotel manager and ultimately the owner of the Hotel Lafayette and on the [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1335.0s)]
*  heels of of World War one where aviation made its debut Raymond Ortague said you [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1340.16s)]
*  know there is a positive potential for aviation and let's you know I'm gonna [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1348.68s)]
*  offer up a $25,000 prize for the first person who flies between New York and [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1354.0s)]
*  Paris or Paris in New York and you you'd go east if you understood know the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1359.28s)]
*  trade winds and and people laughed at that that idea this $25,000 prize which [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1363.0s)]
*  today is somewhere on the neighborhood of eight to ten million dollars [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1370.24s)]
*  depending on inflation and they said it's impossible you know people had [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1373.52s)]
*  never flown anything near that but Ortague threw down the gauntlet and the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1378.28s)]
*  book tells the story of all the teams that attempted to win this $25,000 prize [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1385.56s)]
*  and I remember Greg in reading the book I was underlining how much money because [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1392.6s)]
*  because Lindbergh details this how much money all the different teams were [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1399.3999999999999s)]
*  spending to go after this $25,000 prize and like some teams were spending like [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1404.04s)]
*  $100,000 right the prize was much more than just the money it was like the just [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1409.3999999999999s)]
*  the you know the glory of achieving this this goal had gotten a level of [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1414.68s)]
*  extraordinary attention especially as people were dying in the attempt and [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1420.36s)]
*  failing in the attempt it became much more valued to achieve the this [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1425.84s)]
*  impossible feat and I think when I ended up was like $400,000 was spent by all [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1430.28s)]
*  the teams to go after this $25,000 prize and what I found fascinating and I [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1437.3999999999999s)]
*  remember calling you about this was that Lindbergh was the most unlikely guy to do [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1442.96s)]
*  it he had the least experience of all the teams he had been flying for a [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1448.6399999999999s)]
*  couple of years and in fact no one would sell him an airplane or an engine [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1454.04s)]
*  because they were so fearful that he would fail you know publicly and [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1458.8s)]
*  miserably that they would give him a bad rep and ultimately he went to to Ryan [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1463.24s)]
*  aircraft company and bought one in San Diego made the flight to to st. Louis [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1469.3999999999999s)]
*  from st. Louis to New York and New York to to LaBorgée and we'll tell that story [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1473.96s)]
*  with Eric Lindbergh will be joining us in a little while who recreated that [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1479.36s)]
*  flight with with you as mission control to help save the XPRIZE to financially [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1483.64s)]
*  give us the money to keep doing what we're doing but that book I remember [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  reading that book and it was like I was blown away at the end of reading it I [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1493.0400000000002s)]
*  was like you know and some things happen right when you get this idea from the [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  universe and I said that's it because I've been so frustrated with space that [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1501.96s)]
*  okay I'm gonna do a prize for spaceflight and I wrote down in the [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1508.28s)]
*  margin of the book XPRIZE because I had no idea who was gonna be or Teague or [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1515.0s)]
*  Nobel or Pulitzer who's gonna fund the prize and we'll meet the person in this [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1521.08s)]
*  podcast later Anusha Ansari who had just had a 1.3 billion dollar exit when I [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1525.44s)]
*  when I met her who funded our prize and we ended up naming it the Ansari XPRIZE [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1530.76s)]
*  the X stuck around because it took so long for us to fund the prize but I [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1537.48s)]
*  remember calling you and I called Jim Burke who had been involved in the [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1543.08s)]
*  Kramer Prize and said you know what do you think about this idea so do you [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1548.52s)]
*  remember me calling you about this I do and and it was really interesting [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1551.88s)]
*  because I had actually been saying it's in speeches and even writing in some [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1556.52s)]
*  papers that what commercial spaceflight needed to get going was a Lindbergh like [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1562.2s)]
*  event but I wasn't thinking about the prize doing it with a prize and when you [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1568.04s)]
*  said it it was like one of those V8 moments that that's a great idea and and [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1573.28s)]
*  Jim Burke was an amazing character he was sort of the Indiana Jones of space [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1578.88s)]
*  and as a young man as a 30 year old he was leading the the leading program for [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1582.76s)]
*  the early Apollo program which was to take pictures of the moon with a [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1587.8s)]

*  spectrometer from NASA from the Apollo program and he knew everybody he knew [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1610.76s)]
*  Richard Feynman who gave us some really good advice about prizes which we could [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1616.52s)]
*  talk about separately but oh and the Kramer prize you mentioned the Kramer [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1620.28s)]
*  prize that was a prize for human-powered spaceflight and and Jim [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1626.32s)]
*  empowered I mean airplanes and and Jim had Jim actually had a Gossamer condor [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1629.8799999999999s)]

*  and he and I and Ray Crow and I started a company called Zero Gravity [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1660.1200000000001s)]
*  Corporation together zero G that's it's still operational now 30 plus years [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1665.56s)]
*  later doing the only commercial company to offer parabolic flights well maybe [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1670.2s)]
*  we'll chat about that later because it was very funny zero G started in 93 May [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1675.44s)]
*  of 93 X prize idea came in December of 93 and both of them came into existence [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1682.96s)]
*  within a week of each other 20 years or no I'm sorry 11 years later in 2004 we [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1690.4s)]

*  writing an article for the National Space Society and I started you know [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1715.2s)]
*  asking for donations 25 and hundred dollar donations and we were funding [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1719.5600000000002s)]
*  the X prize in the earliest days 25 bucks and 100 bucks at a time and I [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1725.72s)]
*  remember going to the mailbox back when we had mailboxes and I cared about [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1730.1200000000001s)]
*  mailboxes and opening up envelopes of donations of $25 checks $100 checks and [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1733.72s)]
*  that's how the X prize got started back then what's your what's your earliest [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1738.92s)]
*  memory of getting some early traction here well I remember those days I [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1743.44s)]
*  remember Peter you had a room in your Rockville Maryland department which was [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1748.96s)]
*  all whiteboard it was like an upstairs bedroom and you'd converted it to a [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1753.2s)]
*  giant whiteboard and I remember you and Byron and I tried to figure out what are [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1757.0s)]
*  all the technical ways somebody could could accomplish the feat of suborbital [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1763.3600000000001s)]
*  spaceflight and in fact let's let's take a little detour talk about that for a [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1767.48s)]
*  second please that the the beyond the idea of doing an or t-prize prize to [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1771.48s)]
*  kick open the space for humanity your biggest contribution Peter on the [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1779.96s)]
*  design of X prize was the realization that we could change the way people [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1786.0s)]
*  think about spaceflight in other words that government we could overcome that [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1794.52s)]
*  false assumption that only governments could do it without going into orbit but [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1799.76s)]
*  doing suborbital spaceflight which is 25 times less energy intensive and and [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1803.84s)]
*  means the capex is way smaller that was brilliant and that's what that's what [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1809.1599999999999s)]
*  led us to populating your your whiteboards with all the technical ways [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1814.36s)]
*  that could do it and by the time we were done with X prize we had a team in every [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1818.8799999999999s)]
*  single one of those domains which was pretty amazing remember that we had [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1822.12s)]
*  vertical takeoff vertical landing horizontal takeoff horizontal landing [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1825.8799999999999s)]
*  taking off out of the water landing back on the water using a balloon for a stage [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1829.6999999999998s)]
*  a helicopter first stage being towed behind an airplane underneath an airplane [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1833.4399999999998s)]
*  above an airplane and you're right it was Darwinian evolution of rockets and [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1836.96s)]
*  every one of those was was we had a team representing every possible [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1841.28s)]
*  configuration of going to hundred kilometers yeah we did and and you know [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1846.88s)]
*  that was a I remember you still let me crash at your place because I was living [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1850.76s)]
*  still in the Princeton area and commuting to work in Bethesda Maryland [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1854.68s)]
*  and if I'd stay over you and I would after working all day we would get a [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1858.32s)]
*  bite to eat and then and then work for another five or six hours on this stuff [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1864.56s)]
*  and I remember some of the early interns that we had Eric Anderson made our first [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1868.56s)]
*  web page Jake Lopata from MIT I later helped him get his first job working for [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1876.56s)]
*  I think Gary Hudson I think what you said is important to to explain here you [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1882.56s)]
*  know the question was if we're gonna run this prize how much money should it be [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1887.9199999999998s)]
*  and what should a person have to do I mean you're running an incentive prize [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1892.44s)]
*  right you have prizes like Nobel and Pulitzer which award something that was [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1896.1200000000001s)]
*  done you know years ago sometimes decades ago as an accomplishment but [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1901.72s)]
*  incentive prize is very different it says I don't care who you are where you've [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1907.98s)]
*  ever you know what you've ever done you know where you live if you do this thing [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1912.48s)]
*  if you go New York to Paris you win the money so the antique president's [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1918.8s)]
*  enterprise so the what did you have to do was important and then how much money [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1922.6s)]
*  should it be and I had been in the rocket business you know Greg you were [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1927.3999999999999s)]
*  one of our directors in that in that company as well and I understood how [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1931.84s)]
*  difficult it was to build rockets this was way before SpaceX and people to [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1935.72s)]
*  remember back in the in the early to mid 90s the idea of spaceflight of [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1940.32s)]
*  commercial spaceflight and human spaceflight was insane it was you know [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1946.6s)]
*  this was something the space shuttles were flying at a billion dollars of [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1952.48s)]
*  flight 20,000 person army to operate a shuttle a shuttle mission and so I [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1956.12s)]
*  wanted something that a small team could do I remember it was like it really you [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1964.76s)]
*  know what made the antique prize possible was it was Lindbergh and a few [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1970.2s)]
*  engineers at Ryan aircraft making that vehicle so what is it that someone could [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1973.68s)]
*  do but that was what I call audacious and yet achievable that intersection was [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1978.96s)]
*  so important and so it's okay instead of going to orbit and you're right going to [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1984.24s)]
*  17,500 miles an hour versus you know going to you know an altitude so good [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1990.2s)]
*  let me put in Mach numbers instead of going to Mach 25 you're going to Mach [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=1998.4s)]
*  three you know it's seven times faster to get to orbit when you square velocity [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2002.28s)]
*  to get to energy so like you said it's gonna be like 49 50 times harder to get [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2010.44s)]
*  to orbit compared to suborbital and and you know we gave Alan Shepard wings [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2015.0s)]
*  astronaut wings I was considered a space flight so okay and then the other thing [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2022.16s)]
*  was because I was working on zero G at the time I wanted to have a commercial [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2026.44s)]
*  company come out of this commercial industry right and space tourism was [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2031.08s)]
*  was very much our vision and so okay how how big should the vehicle be if it's [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2036.24s)]
*  one person it's a stunt two people's interesting but a pilot and two paying [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2041.6399999999999s)]
*  passengers a pilot and two buddies or a couple that could be a viable a viable [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2048.84s)]
*  vehicle so we said okay three people going we originally set it at a hundred [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2055.7599999999998s)]
*  miles altitude if you remember famously and then we had some engineers when you [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2060.36s)]
*  and I working on the rule set look at what the peak heating would be if you [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2066.7200000000003s)]
*  came in from a hundred miles altitude and the heating was so high that we were [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2073.2400000000002s)]
*  concerned that you know composites wouldn't be possible you need special [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2078.04s)]
*  kind of heat seek metals and so we lowered it from a hundred miles to a [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2083.04s)]
*  hundred kilometers as we like to joke knowing full well most Americans will [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2088.16s)]
*  know the difference between a hundred kilometers hundred miles and and then [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2092.84s)]
*  the other thing we had a lot of discussions about this a lot of debate [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2097.44s)]
*  about this which was you know we didn't want governments playing this it had to [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2100.8s)]
*  be privately funded and what to find privately funded yeah and there were [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2107.32s)]
*  couple interesting pieces to that one of the reasons we wanted I mean a key [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2112.64s)]
*  reason we wanted it to not be government was just because everybody [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2119.8399999999997s)]
*  thought it had to be governments it wasn't because we don't like governments [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2122.64s)]
*  in fact our biggest supporters turned out to be NASA but and and other [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2125.3599999999997s)]
*  governments have come to like private spaceflight very much and in fact it's [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2130.3999999999996s)]
*  funny that that's ironic that today like China is is is criticizing its companies [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2134.7999999999997s)]
*  for not having produced an Elon or Jeff Bezos do you remember a meeting at David [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2140.84s)]
*  Wines home I do we remember we had a few of those but I remember in fact didn't [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2149.04s)]
*  didn't you have a problem where are you where you were trying to get to st. Louis [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2157.2400000000002s)]
*  but you were stuck in Montrose Colorado we'll tell that story in a moment but [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2161.6000000000004s)]
*  before then I think we had a meeting with David wine in his beautiful home in [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2166.76s)]
*  Montrose Colorado and we had Gary Hudson there and you and a whole slew of [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2170.2s)]
*  others we were debating the rules and I think we ended up saying that you could [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2175.6s)]
*  have 10% government funding and that you could only replace I think like 5% of [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2181.12s)]
*  the mass of the vehicle and I think the most important rule for the XPRIZE was [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2187.68s)]
*  that that when you made your first flight you had to do the second flight [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2191.7599999999998s)]
*  with the same vehicle within two weeks and could only replace 5% of the mass [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2198.6s)]
*  yeah now let's talk about that because that's caused a lot of misunderstanding [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2204.32s)]
*  because we had a sneaky trick there and that was that we didn't want our prize [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2209.48s)]
*  to require us to get into the accounting knickers of every one of our teams we [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2213.64s)]
*  joke nowadays that we want prizes that that we don't want prizes that have all [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2220.52s)]
*  the excitement of double-entry bookkeeping but but so how could we keep [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2225.96s)]
*  the cost down and we you and I realized that that we weren't going to get Rockwell [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2232.36s)]
*  International or Lockheed Martin as contestants so it was going to probably [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2238.0s)]
*  be small groups and it was going to be labor so if we keep the time between [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2241.2400000000002s)]
*  flights small it would keep the cost of refurb small yeah but there was another [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2246.44s)]
*  thing that was going on that the yeah the rule about about what percentage [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2252.0s)]
*  could be government funded was interesting we eventually stole a rule or [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2255.92s)]
*  borrowed a rule from Kodak Kodak company had a competition for amateur [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2260.56s)]
*  photographers but a lot of photographers make a few bucks here and [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2267.84s)]
*  there but it's not enough to live on doing some small jobs so they get [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2272.32s)]
*  disqualified they would be disqualified if they had to be true virgins so we [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2276.88s)]
*  said well you you have to be you can't get more than 10% of your income from [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2280.48s)]
*  government funding because we were concerned that people like in fact [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2285.2000000000003s)]
*  ultimately Burt Rutan won our prize he was getting funding from NASA for some [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2289.28s)]
*  other projects not specifically for his design of his winning entry but we [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2293.2400000000002s)]
*  didn't want any any misunderstanding the other thing about private teams it's [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2299.56s)]
*  that's really important that we talked about a lot and and it turned out to be [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2303.7200000000003s)]
*  pivotally true was that we wanted to get a totally different style of [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2308.64s)]
*  operations than the people that were doing government funded space programs [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2318.16s)]
*  you know I talk about this and I steal this from from Bert Rutan he says the [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2322.3599999999997s)]
*  day before something truly is a breakthrough it's a crazy idea and and [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2326.8399999999997s)]
*  the challenge is that if you really want to break through in spaceflight you need [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2330.52s)]
*  crazy ideas and and governments don't like doing crazy things because they [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2334.2s)]
*  have high failure rates and large corporations that are worried about [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2340.6s)]
*  quarterly stock earning reports and so forth don't like doing crazy things that [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2344.16s)]
*  could fail because of that and you end up only with this you know this crazy [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2348.3599999999997s)]
*  group of rebels which is what we actually attracted in the final result [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2353.52s)]
*  you know this XPRI the first XPRIs brought in 26 teams from seven countries [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2357.72s)]
*  that were incredible rebels and we will chat about some of them and you know it [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2363.4s)]
*  was we created the foundation in 1994 30 years ago hard to believe and it was you [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2368.64s)]
*  know you and I were funding it out of our own pockets doing other work getting [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2377.2400000000002s)]
*  these $25 and $100 donations but and I remembered there was a moment in time I [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2382.42s)]
*  said okay what do we have to sell what do we have to sell that could that could [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2389.36s)]
*  allow us to sell this and I said I think one thing we could sell is where the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2392.96s)]
*  XPRIs is headquartered and I was looking at for obvious reasons I was looking at [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2398.2400000000002s)]
*  Florida I was looking at Houston Texas I was looking at San Diego because of [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2405.28s)]
*  Ryan I was looking at California I was looking at Seattle because Boeing was [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2412.56s)]
*  headquartered there and then I met an individual who played another we have [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2418.16s)]
*  these guardian angels in our lives of this story and and and anybody going [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2423.52s)]
*  after you know a big dream here right our dream to bring it back here is open [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2428.08s)]
*  up commercial spaceflight open up space for humanity that was the vision that [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=2432.56s)]

*  the $25,000 new spirit to come up and sign their name and we had like six or [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3300.08s)]
*  seven names signed up right there Walter Metcalf and and Ralph Korte and Mark [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3304.68s)]
*  Arnold and then we invited people to step up to the podium and sign up for [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3311.0s)]
*  the new spirit of st. Louis organization and if they didn't want to do it [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3317.32s)]
*  publicly there was a form they could fill out and I think at the end of that [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3321.76s)]
*  day we probably had my recollection is probably around 20 individuals who [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3325.92s)]
*  signed up so we raised about a half a million dollars at that moment in time [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3330.68s)]
*  what story do you remember best about raising that it was all the John [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3335.4s)]
*  McDonald story yeah so John McDonald was the chairman of McDonald Douglas [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3339.84s)]
*  Corporation which is now part of Boeing and and for him the $25,000 was was you [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3345.28s)]
*  know not not at all significant but was what would be significant would be him [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3353.48s)]
*  lending his name to this effort yes and he tasked his space wizard Bill [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3358.1800000000003s)]
*  who was heading up the Delta Clipper program when working with people like [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3366.04s)]
*  astronaut Pete Conrad on that program he said what would it cost tell me what it [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3370.26s)]
*  would cost McDonald Douglas to do this X Prize flight to win this prize and and [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3377.0s)]
*  and Bill who we came to know I love you know they did a did a very serious [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3383.2400000000002s)]
*  engineering study on it said we could do it for probably about 60 million dollars [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3388.08s)]
*  50 60 million dollars and the recommendation was that they should [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3391.52s)]
*  support the I don't remember was Bill's recommendation to John or John's [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3400.12s)]
*  recommendation after talking with Bill but the idea is well let's support the [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3403.68s)]
*  effort and if we we decide to get into this business we'll just buy the company [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3407.8s)]
*  that wins which is which is kind of what happened at the end in a way to to Bert [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3411.62s)]
*  Rutan's company so but we had a lot of really courageous relatively small [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3417.04s)]
*  players that weren't multi-millionaires that weren't you know that that people [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3425.4s)]
*  from st. Louis and elsewhere about half of our new spirit members actually [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3429.84s)]
*  ultimately came in fact the best story is probably the Tom Clancy story we'll [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3433.36s)]
*  get to that in a little bit but what happens now that I think is so important [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3438.56s)]
*  is it's March of 1996 we just raised a half million dollars and you know I think [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3443.24s)]
*  Al thought we would get all hundred people to sign up and so what do we do [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3450.72s)]
*  now and it was you know let's gamble we're all gamblers right it's like this [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3456.04s)]
*  is a crazy a crazy field of dreams and Al said we should go ahead and announce [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3463.16s)]
*  the prize and do a huge media event and you know I've since then written about [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3471.48s)]
*  this idea giving birth to an idea above the line of super credibility you know I [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3479.2400000000002s)]
*  so the question was could we announce the X Prize on a global stage in a way [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3484.96s)]
*  that would get the world's attention and get the potential sponsor to come to us [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3491.84s)]
*  if we couldn't go out and find them and so we start aiming and we ended up [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3499.12s)]
*  hitting a date of May 18th of 1996 not far afterwards where we were assembling [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3505.44s)]
*  this super credibility and just to lay out what super credibility looks like [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3513.2s)]
*  we're having a massive press event under the arch in st. Louis on the dais is not [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3517.48s)]

*  any teams yet which we we didn't but it was it had entered this period of super [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3598.84s)]
*  credibility and that was that was amazing I think we ought to fess up Peter [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3605.12s)]
*  that it was not uncontroversial to do this big launch in fact we lost two of [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3612.08s)]
*  our board of directors members who were freaked out by the by and these and [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3620.3199999999997s)]

*  interesting right because our pitch after that was to go to potential [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3652.6s)]
*  sponsors and say listen here's the deal you don't have to pay until after [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3657.04s)]

*  calls I think the next thing happened was that you know I brought Byron with [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3982.7400000000002s)]
*  me and we came to visit you it was still back then astronauts were not as [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3989.78s)]
*  frequent and bringing an astronaut as your calling card still had a level of [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3995.26s)]
*  pizzazz and Byron God bless him you know joined in and we came so here we are [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=3999.98s)]

*  did you think yeah first of all I mean it was crazy and you guys were crazy I [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4020.54s)]
*  was you know I guess because of my background my grandparents being the [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4027.74s)]
*  most famous people on the planet for about ten years straight and then you [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4032.8599999999997s)]
*  know having this incredibly public life and the latter half of their lives they [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4037.98s)]
*  really focused on the balance between advancing technology and preservation of [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4042.22s)]
*  the environment so I thought 10 million bucks into space you know this core idea [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4046.2599999999998s)]

*  so I really was resistant and and and Aunt Reeve was sort of yeah I didn't [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4056.66s)]
*  really get it but you might be interested because you fly and then when [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4063.2999999999997s)]

*  and it hey it's a free dinner couldn't say no to that but as you recall I had [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4073.2999999999997s)]
*  long hair because I kind of couldn't afford a haircut and I was you know [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4080.46s)]
*  walking with a cane and really disabled and not living living a very constricted [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4084.54s)]
*  life but and as I just listened to you guys you and I mean you were so much you [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4091.1s)]
*  know listen we need you know the environments first and you know why why [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4098.54s)]
*  would you focus on space instead of this and Byron and I just opened up with [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4103.62s)]
*  every possible you know argument we possibly could about you know going [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4109.54s)]
*  going to space to save the earth etc it worked I got chills on the back of my [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4115.5s)]
*  neck you know listening to Byron talk about what it's like to see our planet [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4122.74s)]
*  from space and and I still get those chills I want to see that it was it was [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4126.86s)]
*  really powerful and then thinking about you know maybe what we learn from space [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4131.86s)]
*  is what we need to survive on this planet and then you guys were talking [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4136.62s)]
*  about space solar power lessening the burden of our resources you know here on [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4140.9s)]
*  space and that that dialogue you had earlier with Greg is if you're not [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4146.7s)]
*  really thinking about spaceflight and what it can offer us as a species and and [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4152.0199999999995s)]
*  not just humans but all life on planet I don't I don't I think you just poo poo [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4157.34s)]
*  it and that's one of the problems that spaceflight has had yeah I think one of [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4164.22s)]
*  the one of the things that is the most valuable asset from the XPRIZE and from [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4168.780000000001s)]
*  our collective efforts is the ability to dream big again right and I think that's [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4174.22s)]
*  one of the most important elements is is the human spirit of dreaming big of [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4178.66s)]
*  there is no problem we cannot solve so we we swayed you enough and and offered [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4184.5s)]

*  side of a building has an image of my grandfather on it that's way larger than [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4264.82s)]

*  grow up as a Lindbergh there's a certain Lindbergh a phobia that goes with that [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4281.0199999999995s)]
*  because people say oh you're you're Lindbergh you must have grown up with [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4286.46s)]
*  three or four airplanes and so forth and people have all these preconceived [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4289.98s)]
*  notions but my reality was obviously different so I felt kind of really taken [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4294.3s)]
*  aback by all that but it was also really I started to get that glimmer of [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4300.62s)]
*  hope and inspiration of my excitement right that yeah not it not not just [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4308.78s)]
*  about you know spaceflight and what that could bring to humanity but my life I [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4314.82s)]
*  started thinking oh here's this crazy thing I could be involved in and [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4319.66s)]
*  wouldn't it be great if it actually happened little did I know back then [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4324.42s)]
*  about how risky these kind of startups are but but it really gave me as of this [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4329.54s)]
*  incredible inspiration in my life that's carried through to today and that's I [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4335.06s)]

*  that that Dan Golden and Burt Rutan got into a crazy argument almost like yelling at each other [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4385.139999999999s)]
*  Dan Golden is the NASA administrator and Burt Rutan is the [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4397.58s)]
*  radical aviation soon-to-be space entrepreneur and and world famous air [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4403.42s)]

*  XPRIZE announcement he had started a company called Scaled Composites and [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4423.02s)]
*  what his biggest claim to fame at he's real well known in the aviation space [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4427.58s)]
*  but his biggest claim to fame was he built the Voyager aircraft that flew [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4432.14s)]
*  around the world non-stop his brother Dick Rutan was the principal pilot of [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4435.58s)]
*  that so he's really well known but his philosophy is that Lager has with Dan [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4440.5s)]
*  Golden the head of NASA at least seemingly so I think Burt goes listen [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4448.14s)]
*  Dan I think you should take half of NASA's annual budget and like give it to [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4453.660000000001s)]

*  article from a guy named Bill McClellan and I will never forget this because I [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4606.14s)]
*  was so proud of all the incredible press and this article by Bill McClellan says [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4612.5s)]
*  only in st. Louis who built an arch a monument to those who left st. Louis [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4618.22s)]

*  and I was so depressed by that article and I remember Al Kurth saying okay [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4630.98s)]
*  listen you got to go and and and explain to Bill go buy him a few beers and [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4638.0199999999995s)]
*  explain to Bill what you're what you're doing and why you're doing it and I a [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4642.74s)]
*  few weeks later I did that and one of the proudest moments was he wrote a [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4650.78s)]
*  retraction to that piece and he said okay I now get what XPRIZE is doing and [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4656.38s)]
*  why it's doing it and very proud and I remember I framed the original one and [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4661.5s)]
*  the other one above my desk yeah in fact over time he wrote two retractions and [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4666.06s)]
*  and because he was so well known in st. Louis as a brilliant guy but a somewhat [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4671.1s)]
*  of a curmudgeon he apparently had never retracted anything so the fact of those [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4678.06s)]
*  retractions gave us much more good local press than then then then and that was [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4682.46s)]
*  the only bad press we I think we ever got really I do remember that we had [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4687.9800000000005s)]
*  somebody we had some I didn't discover till years later that that somebody in a [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4692.94s)]
*  British science journal had written we must be crazy libertarians because our [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4698.78s)]
*  prizes for non-governmental spaceflight and all this is true not not well not [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4703.34s)]
*  knowing that the head of NASA was there with us and that NASA was very [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4708.26s)]
*  supportive actually of private spaceflight as they are now but and when [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4712.22s)]
*  we worked through through Alan Ladwig at length to get Dan supportive and and one [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4716.34s)]
*  of the things that people don't realize is that when we before when we started [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4722.7s)]
*  this competition the the rules for the FAA for spaceflight did not allow for [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4727.22s)]
*  private for people to go on rockets commercially did not allow for reentry [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4735.38s)]
*  and one of the biggest things we had to overcome during this competition was to [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4743.1s)]
*  get the FAA to rewrite the the laws that would allow for a commercial spaceflight [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4748.1s)]
*  industry to exist and today you know SpaceX and Blue Origin and all the other [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4754.1s)]
*  companies are beneficiaries of that that legal reconstruction that we spent the [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4759.22s)]
*  better part of five six years working on you know I think it's it's worth [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4764.94s)]
*  telling some of the stories between after the launch and where we were you [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=4770.54s)]

*  prizes and if so which one should we do and that was critical money for us that [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5093.12s)]
*  kept us going during 2003 and resulted in NASA's centennial challenges which are [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5096.8s)]
*  their equivalent so but one of the things we we did to keep things going [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5103.64s)]
*  again you know we announced surprise in 96 we don't have any money we are trying [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5108.28s)]

*  started and and I was fact that was sitting around trying to think about a [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5583.56s)]
*  slogan that we could use and and I remember because it this was in Hopewell [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5591.4800000000005s)]
*  where I was living at the time and we were thinking about giving the winner [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5596.24s)]
*  they were gonna have a sort of a lottery and we were going to give the winner of [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5601.5599999999995s)]
*  the lottery a chance to fly on an XPRIZE ship second prize is you didn't have to [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5605.36s)]
*  fly on the ship but anyway I came up with the idea of your ticket to space [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5611.639999999999s)]
*  yes and that was and we had we had people around the world getting these [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5618.12s)]
*  XPRIZE credit cards and the challenging thing was five million dollars [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5625.4s)]
*  was great but it wasn't ten million dollars and we still needed to raise [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5630.96s)]
*  that ten million dollars and we're we're barely hanging on by you know our [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5637.0s)]
*  fingernails operationally there I mean you then move your family out you know [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5644.44s)]
*  we're operating I'm a volunteer chairman of the organization and we [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5649.76s)]
*  had like you know one and a half salaried individuals and and but Bob [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5654.84s)]
*  Weiss comes up with you know so we're still we're pitching we're pitching [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5660.88s)]
*  pitching pitching every CEO every large car company every company and and I [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5664.84s)]
*  remember Bob Weiss corners us one day to talk about something called hole-in-one [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5672.4800000000005s)]
*  insurance yeah so so Bob had got really involved Bob was that guy that that I [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5677.2s)]
*  met on the bus on the day of our first gala and he turned out to be we didn't [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5684.92s)]
*  know that he was a he was a serious techno geek and he he came on board to [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5692.92s)]
*  help us when when we had our first title sponsor Peter we should talk about the [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5703.48s)]
*  blast-off saga at some point but Bob was aware of a kind of insurance that we had [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5708.599999999999s)]
*  never heard of before because we're not sports guys we don't watch golf games [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5718.759999999999s)]
*  it's called hole-in-one insurance so if you watch a golf tournament and they say [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5722.04s)]
*  if someone hits a hole-in-one today they win a brand-new Corvette some insurance [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5728.66s)]
*  company has taken the bet basically that they know with fine detail the [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5734.3s)]
*  actuarial possibilities of you know how hard it is or how easy it is to hit [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5739.599999999999s)]
*  all-in-one and and so instead of having to pay for a whole Corvette you pay [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5743.86s)]
*  some some some amount maybe 10% of it or for 5% of it well Bob had the crazy [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5748.94s)]
*  audacious idea that we ought to try to see if we could find an insurance [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5755.78s)]
*  company that would be crazy enough to take our bet that one of our teams [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5759.98s)]
*  would complete the required feet by some date certain and and maybe we could find [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5765.0599999999995s)]
*  a deal that would let us leverage the money that we did have and indeed we [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5771.3s)]
*  went to because we knew the space business this is mostly on you Peter [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5777.54s)]
*  from your micro space days we went to insurance underwriters in the satellite [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5781.42s)]
*  business and to our surprise they agreed to take our bet now I think the [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5787.5s)]
*  statute of limitations is pretty much wrong on all this stuff so we can we can [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5793.9800000000005s)]
*  tell what really happened so one of the things that happened I got the most [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5798.1s)]
*  extraordinary phone call one day it was after 2000 because I was in the offices [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5801.7s)]
*  that we had on spirit of st. Louis Boulevard at spirit of st. Louis Airport [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5811.0199999999995s)]
*  and it was the insurance company thinking about whether or not to do this [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5815.54s)]
*  deal with us and they asked me to provide them with the names of space [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5823.5s)]
*  experts that could help them figure out the the odds basically yes so that's [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5827.58s)]
*  like when you're a trial lawyer and you get to pick the jury yourself without [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5833.5s)]
*  the other side so because I gave them the names of very serious people that I [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5836.98s)]
*  knew in the space business who believed that only NASA and God could they didn't [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5843.0199999999995s)]
*  they weren't even sure the Russians could do it I knew she you obviously [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5846.94s)]
*  proved that they could but they were I picked the the biggest skeptics of of [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5850.94s)]
*  yeah they were serious people I didn't load the deck completely but but they [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5859.46s)]
*  were very credible well-known people but they had the common belief that it was [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5865.46s)]
*  it wasn't gonna happen so we did find a company and it enabled us to roughly [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5869.9800000000005s)]
*  almost double our our striking power for that so we end up basically negotiating [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5877.9s)]
*  a deal that this insurance company would pay out the other five million dollars [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5884.46s)]
*  by December 17 2003 and we'll go into this a little bit later but of course no [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5890.3s)]
*  one won the X prize by December 17 2003 and the five million dollar from first [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5897.38s)]
*  USA was going away and there was going to be there was ultimately a [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5901.7s)]
*  renegotiation the deal where the insurance company needed to back it [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5906.06s)]
*  through what we set the new date of through the end of 2004 most people [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5911.3s)]
*  don't know that the original or take prize ended in 1925 and Raymond or take [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5917.18s)]
*  actually extended it and so it was not unusual in fact to this day X prize [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5922.5s)]
*  sometimes extends the prize deadlines but deadlines are important I hate to [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5928.46s)]
*  use the word dead but deadlines are important because they incentivize teams [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5933.34s)]
*  to do you know to like like make it happen to take their shot otherwise if [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5937.26s)]

*  what what what one of the things that strikes me right here is we're talking [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5947.599999999999s)]
*  through this history about about the Ansari X prize is that the time scale [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5951.36s)]
*  is a lot longer than we're able to discuss yeah and those those deadlines [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5956.599999999999s)]
*  of making the payments on on on the premiums for the prize and that and that [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5963.28s)]
*  and the pressure on the fundraising it lasted for what ever nine years and that [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5969.0s)]
*  was just the beginning yeah I mean so I'll tell a little bit and and I want to [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5975.56s)]
*  lead us to two stories one Eric your story of recreating your grandfather's [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5982.6s)]
*  flight and the second is of meeting our other patron saint Anusha Ansari so we [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5987.52s)]
*  negotiate this deal with the insurance company and ultimately they are going to [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=5994.76s)]
*  charge us on the order of I forget the exact amount was like two and a half [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6000.52s)]
*  million three million dollars that it's a bet they're like okay if you pay us [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6004.400000000001s)]
*  this premium and someone wins we'll pay the ten million dollars if you pay this [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6009.4800000000005s)]
*  premium and no one wins we keep the premium so it's it's legalized gambling [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6016.34s)]
*  it's what this insurance policy is and we get that we get the you know when we [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6020.52s)]
*  got to the point where the insurance company is going to have to cover the [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6025.76s)]
*  whole ten million and go through the end of 2004 we get their premium [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6029.52s)]
*  requirements and I remember Bruce Krasowski and and Mr. Ede were [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6034.360000000001s)]
*  negotiating this for us and the problem was we they were asking us for like two [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6040.92s)]
*  and a half three million Greg was that your memory of the the premium amount [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6047.84s)]
*  yeah I mean but at the end of the day our total premiums were close to five [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6050.96s)]
*  million bucks so but we didn't have that money and and so I was like shit what [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6056.28s)]
*  we're gonna do and I had an insight I said okay listen here's the deal I want [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6063.400000000001s)]

*  then we'll do a balloon payment that fifty thousand dollars a month is going [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6074.08s)]
*  to give us time to go and raise the full amount whatever whatever it was three [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6078.400000000001s)]
*  four million dollars and I remember you know we would have it would be Monday [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6085.04s)]
*  and we would have fifty thousand dollars due on Friday and if we didn't pay it [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6091.64s)]
*  the whole thing was over you know we'd announced the fact that we had the ten [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6097.08s)]
*  million dollars through an insurance policy to the teams we didn't publicly [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6100.84s)]

*  yet and it was a lot of a lot of stress and yeah by the way I mean we should we [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6112.16s)]
*  should say Peter we always told the teams exactly what was going on yes we [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6117.400000000001s)]

*  their time but they were they were doing something that we knew was hazardous and [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6125.360000000001s)]
*  you know we were we were very straight up with them and it formed the basis for [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6129.719999999999s)]
*  all of our team agreements going forward into the future and so but you know but [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6133.5199999999995s)]

*  fashion to keep the organization alive and to keep this prize and I think one [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6175.0s)]
*  of the things I want folks to understand is we died a thousand deaths we were over [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6183.2s)]

*  just my hands and I climbed and skied Mount Rainier and I was Washington State champion gymnast and [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6594.52s)]
*  anything I wanted to do physically I could do pretty well if I trained a little bit I could compete [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6602.280000000001s)]
*  so I have you know boxes full of water ski trophies and things like that and that that physical sense [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6608.4400000000005s)]
*  of self when I was in high school I thought if I ever got stuck behind a desk pushing a pencil for [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6613.52s)]
*  a job I would kill myself I didn't know what I would do with that because I was so physical and [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6619.76s)]
*  then of course rheumatoid arthritis came along and it's like having your knee sprained and then [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6624.92s)]
*  your other knee sprained at the same time and then it moves around your body and it mirrors itself in [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6631.080000000001s)]
*  your joints and slowly decays your cartilage and I ended up bone on bone in my knees and that's when [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6636.04s)]
*  you guys met me. Yeah really a low point and I think that was a you know a bottom that led to [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6643.56s)]
*  this incredible achievement and I think in 2000 Greg the XPRIZE Foundation was at a low point as [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6654.68s)]
*  well we're on fumes we are basically everybody is employed by I think you're the only employee [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6662.56s)]
*  at XPRIZE at this point and maybe even part-time and when Eric said I'm gonna recreate this [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6670.92s)]
*  flight and we'll do it as a fundraiser I'm like awesome all in not being as worried about about [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6677.84s)]
*  my family was concerned. As Greg was. I'll do anything to get this damn prize funded. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6687.400000000001s)]
*  I mean just to give you a feel for how bad things were we were pretty sure we were losing [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6694.0s)]
*  our title sponsor I remember you and Bob Weiss and I had a meeting at Pasadena and I took a [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6702.04s)]
*  red-eye home from that and discovered that my car which I had a park outside at the airport [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6708.0s)]
*  because we didn't know you know because we were broke basically had been hit by hail and I took [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6715.8s)]
*  the car into to a whole many cars were were were hail damaged so they the insurance company set up [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6722.84s)]
*  these tent cities where you could go and get an estimate and my my number two daughter needed [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6729.64s)]
*  like five thousand dollars for orthodontia and they offered me five thousand twenty seven dollars [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6735.8s)]
*  and eighteen cents that I said I have twenty seven dollars and eighteen cents because my car looked [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6741.4s)]
*  like a park like a basketball like a like a golf ball we were we were totally broke and yeah I [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6747.799999999999s)]
*  just want to point this as a low point for the foundation in 2000 right and just to remind [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6753.879999999999s)]
*  everybody today the XPRIZE has launched nearly six hundred million dollars in in competitions [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6760.679999999999s)]
*  has driven billion dollars in R&D and you know this is not an overnight success this is an [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6766.88s)]
*  overnight success after 30 years of hard work 11 years for the first competition I just want to [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6773.76s)]
*  bring it back to the notion that we're the only thing kept us going was this fundamental belief [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6779.76s)]
*  of this this importance the human spirit that we were on a an extraordinary mission and nothing [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6785.76s)]
*  would keep us from that and the only way that we would fail is if we gave up along the way and so [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6794.04s)]
*  let's take a second and before I introduce Anusha Ansari who is is the next chapter in the story you [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6801.4s)]
*  make a decision to go forward with this with this flight across the Atlantic and what was entailed [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6811.44s)]
*  Oh gosh well it was we had about a year and a half to get to the 75th anniversary and we quickly [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6818.84s)]
*  you know had some meetings around St. Louis to understand feasibility back-of-the-napkin [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6825.64s)]
*  calculations of you know distance mileage and money what was it going to take and who do we [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6831.8s)]
*  need on board and what could what's the messaging that we could carry and and how big could we go [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6838.24s)]
*  and I mean it technically it was it was feasible some guy did it 75 years before you know so in [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6842.88s)]
*  an old airplane the family feasibility for me was much tougher I mentioned I had this [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6851.4400000000005s)]
*  limberga phobia and I think the rest of my family was used to not putting themselves out into the [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6858.92s)]
*  public eye and just and just a perspective right your grandfather's first child was kidnapped and [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6864.400000000001s)]
*  killed yeah and that because of the pinnacle of attention and then there was this reaction to pull [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6870.24s)]
*  back and to really become a private life and I think all of your siblings and cousins you know [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6879.5599999999995s)]
*  didn't like the attention they they didn't they reacted negatively to the idea that you were going [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6887.4s)]
*  to put yourself out there visibly and physically to do this and you had to overcome that it wasn't [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6892.5199999999995s)]
*  just that oh you're gonna you know hurt yourself Eric and we could never forgive ourselves for [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6899.84s)]
*  that but it was you know what are you doing and and and you know you're stepping into a legacy [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6905.12s)]
*  that has a tremendous amount of pain involved in it and and and and positive and negative sides of [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6912.92s)]
*  that there's an amazing new book out right now called a convenient villain where it details all [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6919.96s)]
*  of the reasons why my grandfather was who he was was this incredible entrepreneurial character [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6926.56s)]
*  who was brilliant in the field of aeronautics and astronautics as well but politically naive [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6933.320000000001s)]
*  and he stuck his neck out and he he was a patriot and and did all these things but it it kind of it [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6938.92s)]
*  that gets you a better feel for the kind of focus that was heaped on the family that that had this [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6945.4800000000005s)]
*  burden of legacy and for me I realized in that feasibility study that that I had to do this [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6952.64s)]
*  mission I had to break free of those chains from that legacy that were not mine I just inherited [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6962.64s)]
*  them and so I realized that the resistance I was getting from family I needed to push through and [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6970.76s)]
*  that aligned me fully to do this and to take the physical risk and then Greg and I of course you [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6978.96s)]
*  know went about finding sponsors for the flight and and we went to Oshkosh Air venture where you [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6986.24s)]
*  know it's my first trip there and we I forget if it was the first trip for the second trip we spent [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6992.0s)]
*  the night in a school room and some out near the prison we got a whole classroom to ourselves but [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=6996.56s)]
*  we found most of our sponsors there and then we talked to the company that was making the breakthrough [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7002.400000000001s)]
*  biotechnology drug that really wanted to get the news out and of course X-Prize was on board so we [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7007.92s)]
*  started pulling together the funding for that and then made a partnership with the Lance Air [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7015.8s)]
*  company and Lance Neibauer to take a plane and make it worthy of the transatlantic flight by adding [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7020.76s)]
*  a ton of fuel to it and give it that longevity and then we started training and and that was you [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7029.24s)]
*  know an extraordinary period of all of a sudden I'm really laser focused on my prime directive [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7039.28s)]
*  which was not necessarily to raise the money or fly from New York to Paris but it was to survive [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7044.36s)]
*  you know it as we tell the story we were in the middle of our fundraising when 9-11 happened in [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7049.4s)]
*  fact I was driving to meet with the Missouri Historical Society which had heard to the grapevine [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7061.639999999999s)]
*  that we were going to get American Airlines funding for our flight and they were trying to [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7068.44s)]
*  get funding from American Airlines for a traveling Lindberg exhibit so the the boss of the museum [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7073.2s)]
*  wanted to cut a deal with me to to split that money somehow and get you know get a piece of [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7078.96s)]
*  the action and as I was driving to that meeting the first plane hit the towers and and the head [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7084.16s)]
*  of Ohiss and I saw the second one hit because we had set up a TV in his office and that was the end [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7090.92s)]
*  of that so we we lost about half of our potential funding from that but as it was of course it turned [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7096.6s)]
*  out to be the bridge that kept us going in fact Eric and I were in New York City doing media [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7104.599999999999s)]

*  and why don't you pick up the story from there yeah so i was taking some time off with family [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7497.24s)]
*  because we had worked non-stop for over 10 years building a company we sold the company [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7505.64s)]
*  and then ended up working for sonus network up until you know the debacle of of 2000 and 2001 [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7512.28s)]
*  in 2001 and and so we were taking some time off and i received a call i said i had said no meetings [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7522.44s)]
*  because all of a sudden because i was in the papers everyone wanted to talk to me about money [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7529.639999999999s)]
*  and donation and i wasn't ready i so she calls me and says that there's someone who wants to meet [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7535.16s)]
*  with you and talk to you and he said he wants to talk to you about space and at that time when we [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7543.08s)]
*  had sold the company i had made the decision that i wanted to go back to the passion i had since [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7551.64s)]
*  childhood and going to space i had enrolled in a masters in astronomy i was studying i was [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7557.64s)]
*  researching to see what are my possibilities and how can i get involved in an industry that i had [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7563.88s)]
*  nothing to do with and decided that suborbital was probably the most viable option for me at that [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7569.56s)]
*  time and when she mentioned space i'm like oh 100 first meeting when i come back and we came back i [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7578.68s)]
*  don't remember exactly about a few weeks after that and you and byron were the first people i [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7587.72s)]
*  met with yes in our office i remember i was like byron you have to come with me first of all you [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7594.200000000001s)]
*  were in dallas and byron was i think in houston and it's like i have to bring my my astronaut with me [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7599.8s)]
*  is where i go i use that game card with eric and i was going to use it again with with anusha [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7605.799999999999s)]
*  and that made a big difference because i had never met an astronaut and byron was the first [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7612.04s)]
*  astronaut i ever met and you know just sitting next to him and and having him talk about [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7618.759999999999s)]
*  his experience and space flight and giving me an autographed picture that was like i was in heaven [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7624.92s)]
*  so we so i want to tell this story a little bit so to give some context here you were born in [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7633.0s)]
*  tijeran and you grew up what was your childhood like and what was your connection to space [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7639.72s)]
*  well i i fell in love with the night skies basically i wasn't thinking about going to [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7646.6s)]
*  space but as a child i was very curious i i'm still very curious and that gets me into all [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7653.56s)]
*  sorts of trouble but i slept outside we didn't have air conditioning i slept outside at night [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7658.68s)]
*  summertime and just gazing at the night sky was this field of possibility it's a place where [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7666.6s)]
*  your imagination can basically make up anything you want and and that's what i did as a child [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7674.84s)]
*  because i had a normal childhood until i was 12 and revolution happened in iran which brought [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7680.92s)]
*  you know guns and violence and screaming and shouting to my door for the first time in my [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7687.48s)]
*  life and then the war between iran and iraq happened where you know all the things that come [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7693.959999999999s)]
*  with a war again death destruction uh lack of food water electricity blackouts all the time [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7700.44s)]
*  bombings sirens going to bunkers and all of that was too much for me to handle so [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7709.88s)]
*  space became this refuge for me a place where in my mind i would go there and tell myself stories [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7717.4800000000005s)]
*  of this wonderful peaceful place the star trek world and you were trekkie along with me [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7725.0s)]
*  along with all of us yeah i was i started watching star trek in iran dub dem farse all sorts of sci-fi [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7731.16s)]
*  but star trek was my favorite and spock was my favorite character because i wanted to i didn't [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7738.68s)]
*  want to be the captain i wanted to be the science officer the person who discovers all sorts of [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7744.12s)]
*  things and so i was on a journey of discovery when i looked at the night skies and that's what i [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7749.240000000001s)]
*  tried a few decades later in your office hamid who is your husband then amir your brother-in-law then [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7757.320000000001s)]
*  another brother of hamid is there and barry and i are pitching you and we're saying basically [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7766.92s)]
*  listen we're looking for a title sponsor we're looking for at that point the money to cover [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7775.72s)]
*  this hole-in-one insurance balloon payment and then monies to operate the foundation [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7783.639999999999s)]
*  and i'm like it's it's like i remember i couldn't sleep the night before because i was so excited [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7789.16s)]
*  like this is the person this is the person i had felt that feeling before but not anywhere near as [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7795.64s)]
*  much and i remember leaving your room your offices without a yes and i was dismayed by that [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7801.08s)]
*  and so what was what was going on in your in your mind back then and and you know what did you what [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7813.160000000001s)]
*  did you think why didn't you tell me yes on the spot you could have saved me a lot of heartache [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7821.4800000000005s)]
*  Iranian in me [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7825.64s)]
*  i know but um so we were sitting there and you you know gave your powerpoint presentation and [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7829.400000000001s)]
*  we had a good conversation and i remember thinking to myself that you were describing [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7836.200000000001s)]
*  this competition and i had not thought of a competition at all but you were describing [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7841.4800000000005s)]
*  how you're going to ask the world to build a spaceship in their garage and then fly not once [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7846.6s)]
*  two times before they would get any money and i'm thinking to myself wow what a brilliant [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7854.76s)]
*  approach to innovation as an entrepreneur you know i had selected teams build teams asked them to [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7862.360000000001s)]
*  build things usually you know they were late they didn't deliver exactly what i wanted i had to pay [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7868.280000000001s)]
*  them upfront before they delivered anything i'm like we should do this more in building things [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7873.96s)]
*  and especially a high risk thing which is what you know most of the companies that my family [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7880.04s)]
*  and i built were about doing things at the edge so i i had the risk taking gene in me already and [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7886.2s)]
*  i saw this as a way to do risky things but risk mitigated through a competition so in my you know [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7893.88s)]
*  sort of calculating head i was thinking oh this this is a brilliant approach on the other hand [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7900.6s)]
*  my you know kit the space kid that's in me just loved it because i wanted to go to space myself [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7906.68s)]
*  but i also didn't want it to just be about me going to space and i wanted it to be something [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7915.240000000001s)]
*  that lasts afterwards so the fact that we were asking the teams to basically build a reusable [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7923.240000000001s)]
*  access to space that twice within two weeks told me that this is going to happen we wanted to build [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7929.88s)]
*  a business i mean part of what you described to me a whole industry in space and that sort of also [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7935.96s)]
*  struck a note with me i didn't i in my mind i had said yes but not verbally to you but and i wanted [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7942.44s)]
*  to consult with the rest of the family frankly also we had glass across the table i felt like [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7950.92s)]
*  you know some were skeptical some of them were okay but i wanted to make sure everyone was on board [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7957.88s)]
*  because it was significant even though we had sold the company for 1.3 billion soon after that [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7964.92s)]
*  the stock went you know no we take cash in your shop always take cash it was next next time next [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7971.56s)]
*  time but but so it was a significant investment for for us to do this it wasn't nothing as i wanted [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7979.64s)]
*  to get consensus as we were all making this bet together and and i truly didn't think of it as a [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7990.04s)]
*  donation i felt it was an investment in the future and it was an investment in the future that i [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=7996.28s)]
*  wanted to be a part of and so it took us a little bit to get back to you and say yes so i'm back in [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8002.04s)]
*  my apartment in santa monica the same place where i'd read that article and just like hunted you [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8009.96s)]
*  down and i get a call from hamid your then husband with you on the phone and i'm like i'm just like [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8014.92s)]
*  i have a nervous school kid right like what's gonna happen my entire future the future of [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8025.16s)]
*  humanity lays in the balance here are they gonna say yes or are they gonna say no and and you said [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8030.28s)]
*  yes and you said that you would you would fund the capital it was on the order of like five [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8037.8s)]
*  plus million dollars i forget the exact amount it covered all of our insurance payments it gave us [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8045.4800000000005s)]
*  a couple million dollars of operating capital to keep the foundation going and it was interesting [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8049.88s)]
*  right because you said listen we will backstop this if you can find another sponsor to put up [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8057.16s)]
*  the money to put up the 10 million dollars we'll give you some of it and and so you you know you [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8065.16s)]
*  realize that as a family you weren't bringing a massive pr budget to the table and if we had [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8071.88s)]
*  you know virgin x prize or amazon x prize or some other large organization that would put a pr [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8078.2s)]
*  push behind it would be better for the overall thing but we never did find that person and [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8085.5599999999995s)]
*  yeah and i remember sitting up those meetings with you and going to them we went to houston [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8091.4s)]
*  rockets we felt like they probably will say yes we talked to dell we talked to bill bank and so [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8096.76s)]
*  many others and nobody saw the opportunity it's crazy the potential we all saw in it now everyone [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8104.28s)]
*  wants to be part of it or people did see the opportunity but then thought oh what's the [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8112.36s)]
*  downside and decided not to yeah i remember people telling me actually i remember people [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8118.36s)]
*  saying that you guys are crazy because you're going to get people killed and especially with [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8127.0s)]
*  the you know challenger accident columbia accident everything that was fresh in everyone's mind [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8132.44s)]
*  and i had to actually write an op-ed about it because i was saying that you know people who go [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8138.12s)]
*  to the space business or flying to space they understand the risk there is a bigger purpose [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8144.52s)]
*  and and a and a belief in the future and they do it with the knowledge of the risk and you know [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8150.84s)]
*  stopping all the progress in space exploration is dishonoring their memories because we're saying [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8158.92s)]
*  that what you believe in didn't matter or it wasn't right or it was not a good idea and i think [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8165.72s)]
*  that's what people miss and so you just needed the sister in your brotherhood that's that's why [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8172.4400000000005s)]
*  yes for sure you were definitely the the missing missing component and then you know it was a it [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8179.320000000001s)]
*  was you know if this was a movie this would be the you know end of act two you know we're at the low [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8185.320000000001s)]
*  point they were coming out into the high point and i want to bring us back to what was going on circa [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8192.28s)]
*  2001 2002 we're after the dot-com bust we're after 9-eleven anusha comes through eric you're [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8197.56s)]
*  flying your flight now in 2002 anusha you were in mission control there and then we also started [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8209.4s)]
*  meeting all the teams and let's let's go back to some of those stories of some of those teams [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8217.96s)]
*  because they were truly extraordinary [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8225.8s)]
*  anusha or greg where do you want to go i remember two teams specifically one was of course [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8230.36s)]
*  bert and his big character and bert rutan and meeting him at scale composite and [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8237.32s)]
*  i remember him showing us the sketches and the designs he had and i also remember he didn't take [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8245.08s)]
*  me that seriously because it's like uh i don't know if she's serious about this whether she's [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8252.36s)]
*  you know truly passionate about this and uh and i think it took me a while yeah it took me a while [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8259.880000000001s)]
*  to to to get him to warm up to me but i'm used to that being in the tech business and a place [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8266.04s)]
*  where women are not taken as seriously but it was um it was truly exciting to just see all the [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8271.480000000001s)]
*  different designs and approach it the other one that i remember and i think i met him at an isu [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8278.52s)]
*  event um he was the part of the argentinian team it was this guy who was building a balloon [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8284.12s)]
*  takeoff up and and he was basically having his neighbors and the entire you know community [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8291.32s)]
*  bringing him material and stuff and helping him build this balloon and you know he was the most [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8298.04s)]
*  unlikely person to build a spaceship and in this case a balloon that would apply him and uh but he [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8303.8s)]
*  was like determined this is greg do you want to recount the uh the details there yeah well the [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8312.599999999999s)]
*  argentinian guy was pablo de león um and i visited him after lecturing at isu in chile i realized [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8317.8s)]
*  south america skinny it's easy to get to to the buenos ares from chile so i went to see him and [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8326.12s)]
*  i you're right it was a sort of a neighborhood organization but this guy was he was very serious [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8333.480000000001s)]
*  and he's he was actually a spacesuit expert and was doing quite a lot of work with nasa [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8339.240000000002s)]
*  so he was very interesting uh we had a a canadian uh company brian feeney was headed heading that up [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8344.36s)]
*  that was a balloon launch and he said look i'm not bert rootan i'm not a he's using an airplane [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8352.199999999999s)]
*  to drop his spaceship but i i'm not good at designing airplanes mine's going to be stupidly [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8359.56s)]
*  simple i'm going to use balloon and when i saw the they call those they call those raccoons right [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8365.48s)]
*  rockets and balloons that's right raccoons from the 1950s the only other person i ever knew who [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8373.8s)]
*  knew what a raccoon was was our own bob weiss yes but um because he's a student of space history but [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8378.76s)]
*  that was interesting because they were they had actually filed the notice with us that they were [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8389.0s)]
*  going to launch about the same time as bert and we really couldn't afford to put on a big show [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8393.16s)]
*  at canada and the u.s and and we we thought that actually his notice was probably [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8400.44s)]
*  more than optimistic it was probably it was sort of a ploy to ride on the coattails of of where [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8409.0s)]
*  we were but um hard to tell and they were but they they they built some hardware uh the company that [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8415.0s)]
*  surprised me the most was some folks that said what's the most produced rocket that's ever flown [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8422.68s)]
*  to space and the answer is it's the german v2 yes because those rockets flew suborbically [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8428.36s)]
*  during world war ii and they said what we're going to do is we're going to replicate [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8435.400000000001s)]
*  the v2 design now we we had a there's a professor who had worked at mcdonnell douglas for many years [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8442.12s)]
*  and he was teaching at parks college of saint louis university named um dr paul sizz and he [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8450.68s)]
*  called me one day i just i had just moved to to saint louis so it was 98 it was winter of 98 and [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8458.12s)]
*  he says um one of your teams is coming to visit me and i want to invite you to they hadn't told [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8463.960000000001s)]
*  me so he said i want to invite you to come along and i'm i met the folks and um they were based in [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8471.08s)]
*  paradoxically in london ontario london being the target for many of the v2 rockets in world war ii [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8479.880000000001s)]
*  and the reason they were coming to saint louis was because uh saint louis university had been [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8486.359999999999s)]
*  given a v2 rocket engine by warner on on during the 50s and they were going to come and look at [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8493.72s)]
*  it and take some measurements on it well do you know what what was interesting was the company [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8498.52s)]
*  the team was called canadian arrow and uh shortly after 9 11 um they they drove their full scale [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8502.84s)]
*  v2 rocket on the on a flatbed truck into time square yep and so and it was like what is it was [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8511.88s)]
*  like this missile in the middle of new york city uh and we had a lot of a lot of x-prize media [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8520.039999999999s)]
*  they did it they did it for our event yeah i remembered that yeah but the the funny thing was [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8526.199999999999s)]
*  was that um uh well anyway they said that they were going to make a stretch version of the rocket [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8532.519999999999s)]
*  and and the head of the the outfit whose name i forget this moment said we're not going to do [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8539.16s)]
*  i'm not allowing my engineers to make any changes whatsoever and that's how we're going to do it [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8545.08s)]
*  within the budget and i i figured they're going to just to come up with a rocket engine for 10 [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8550.68s)]
*  million dollars if you have to build it yourself is pretty close to impossible given the economics [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8556.76s)]
*  of the situation but they did it they they they reproduced the engine and they test fired it [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8562.36s)]
*  thanksgiving ish 2003 and we had a team that was in huntsville alabama and i went down to huntsville [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8569.720000000001s)]
*  for their for their opening announcement and one of the original german rocket guys who was in [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8579.640000000001s)]
*  charge of propulsion for v2s was still alive and he was down there and he had given some advice [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8586.36s)]
*  to that canadian aero team so the canadian aero people sent me a video of the test firing of the [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8592.52s)]
*  engine and i took him off on the side so as not to steal any thunder and showed it to him and he [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8597.640000000001s)]
*  said with a great german accent oh they're running it must be running at pressure fed because it's [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8603.08s)]
*  running too rich and i could see it nobody had seen one of those engines for 60 years but he [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8607.08s)]
*  was exactly right we we had some serious teams but but it was always a challenge to make it look [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8612.52s)]
*  like a horse race when there weren't a whole lot of horses there were 26 horses but the challenge [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8620.04s)]
*  of course was funding as with all of these right um you know i had set it at a 10 million dollar [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8626.84s)]
*  prize amount because when i thought about how i would do it and how much would cost me to take [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8633.240000000002s)]
*  a run at this back from my international microspace my rocket days you know a few [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8639.64s)]
*  years earlier i said it's going to be at least 10 million so 10 million x room mineral 10 it works [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8647.8s)]
*  well x for experimental and 10 million was i think a minimum amount that would get someone serious [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8654.76s)]
*  and it was the largest prize ever in human history at that time by by a significant amount [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8661.24s)]
*  um and and we all knew bert rutan um and and bert of course very famously uh on may 18th of 1996 [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8667.16s)]
*  uh we had just announced the competition on the stage under the arch in st louis hundreds of [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8678.6s)]
*  reporters cameras there and that night we had a gala at the st louis science center with the laser [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8685.16s)]
*  show and all and bert rutan stands up um as one of our speakers and he's there because he's an [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8692.68s)]
*  aviation expert uh and he's there because of his fame um you know with voyager and all he'd built [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8699.160000000002s)]
*  more uh first flight aircraft than all the prime contractors put together but he stands up and he [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8707.320000000002s)]
*  goes um i'm not going to tell you what i've come up with because i want to win this thing [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8714.44s)]
*  and he threw his hat in the ring as the very first team that very night the night we announced the [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8721.880000000001s)]
*  competition and then very quickly we had a team a team from romania which was amazing we had you [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8728.76s)]
*  know uh we had teams from around the world um and but bert was always the dark horse meaning [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8735.960000000001s)]
*  not the dark horse he was always the most experienced but he wouldn't tell us what he was [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8743.88s)]
*  doing um and uh it's worth stating that you know at one point uh greg you and i went to go and pitch [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8749.4s)]
*  paul allen uh to fund the x-prize meeting with dave moore and others and they were very cryptic [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8758.599999999999s)]
*  because i was you know paul was a star trek fan uh and super wealthy but uh but we got a no [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8767.48s)]
*  and i was like man i get richard branson says no paul allen says no what's going on [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8775.880000000001s)]
*  and little did we know that in fact uh burt rutan and paul allen had been talking and bert had talked [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8783.24s)]
*  paul allen into being his sugar daddy to fund uh the competent his his vehicle space reform [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8790.36s)]
*  and version had a sneaky deal on the side that we didn't know about to the very end [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8800.12s)]
*  yeah yeah yeah that's interesting because he was willing to write a bigger check [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8804.84s)]
*  at 30 million million dollar check to scale than to x-prize and i think you know when i look back [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8810.28s)]
*  at all the people who said no to you peter i can't understand their logic because uh you know [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8817.16s)]
*  at that time since we had taken off the operation with the with the insurance they really didn't [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8824.84s)]
*  have much at risk they only paid if someone won the prize and you know that to me was like if [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8831.56s)]
*  someone has already built and demonstrated a spaceship it's definitely worth more than [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8839.4s)]
*  10 million i mean why wouldn't you and and i couldn't understand the so it's interesting how [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8845.0s)]
*  i see that again today you know in philanthropy one thing that was fascinating was that paul uh [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8851.32s)]
*  required bert to keep his involvement secret and the only time that he allowed it to be publicly [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8857.4s)]
*  disclosed was after uh uh the first successful powered flight through the transonic period and [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8865.16s)]
*  i think what's interesting is you know when you've gotten so wealthy um that you don't want to seem [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8876.2s)]
*  stupid you don't want to you don't want to publicly um announce that you're doing something and then [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8882.039999999999s)]
*  have it fail so i think the point at which paul was willing to say that he was backing [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8889.88s)]
*  one of the teams was when the the technical risk had been reduced i guess i can understand that [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8896.599999999999s)]
*  but again when you look at it uh you know anyone who's been an entrepreneur when you ask them [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8903.32s)]
*  you know one of the ingredients of being an entrepreneur and succeeding is the fact that you [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8909.8s)]
*  need to understand that you will have failures and that you need to feel comfortable with those [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8914.68s)]
*  failures and learn from them and build again and and sort of have this grit this perseverance to [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8920.2s)]
*  be able to push forward and without risk and without failure you can really take those giant [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8926.68s)]
*  leaps forward you will always be just incrementally inching your way up and i think um that's something [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8933.880000000001s)]
*  that i feel it's important to highlight and people who reach a certain amount of notoriety [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8940.92s)]
*  wealth recognition um understood elon musk and they don't care about you know what everyone thinks [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8948.6s)]
*  they um they become risk averse uh and it's a shame because they surround themselves with people [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8956.84s)]
*  who are their blockers who are are you know they are to say no all the time and you become so [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8962.92s)]

*  to take us back to a moment when we all saw spaceship one for the first time um and so [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8976.92s)]
*  birds in the mojave desert uh and we're uh you know we're invited for the unveiling and i would [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8983.88s)]
*  have loved to have been on the inside a little bit more but we weren't um and appropriately so [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8991.48s)]
*  when we're running this competition uh but uh we all go there together um what was your what was [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=8996.68s)]
*  your what do you guys think when you first saw spaceship one to me it was unlike anything i [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9003.48s)]
*  imagined and and uh so different than normal ways of traveling to space and it felt like a little [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9009.56s)]
*  you know mini plane and and uh and i was like it looked beautiful it was beautiful high degree of [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9016.04s)]
*  beauty exactly and and the fact that actually it was on a plane and taking the first part of [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9023.08s)]
*  the flight on a plane and then just uh you know firing the rockets later on at i think 60 miles [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9030.36s)]
*  um 60 60 60 000 feet um uh it sort of made it less risky i don't know it doesn't necessarily make it [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9038.039999999999s)]
*  less risky and then he also talked about the landing and the special feather feature and all [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9046.84s)]
*  of that was really unique and fascinating and beautiful greg what do you think [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9052.76s)]
*  well you know i i had one of the same responses you had anusha it's little i mean i knew it was [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9058.84s)]
*  going to be little but i've flown stuff lots bigger than that and it's like well that's tiny [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9064.36s)]
*  well what actually i remember the most about it was you know poor burt had lost his voice remember [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9069.72s)]
*  that he could barely speak and he was up at the lectern and and talking about it and he said [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9075.0s)]
*  something really interesting we what nobody knew was that burt had just faxed his master team [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9080.76s)]
*  agreement to us like less than 24 hours before that rollout so burt it it was a signed agreement [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9087.880000000001s)]
*  that he was going to compete actually compete in the competition yeah so that was a big deal [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9100.2s)]
*  and i think that was on his mind because he one of the things he got up and said was something [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9105.32s)]
*  that justified the work that we had done in setting up the prize because most people you know now we [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9109.56s)]
*  now we kind of know how to do it but we spent a year on the rules for the sorry x prize before [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9116.359999999999s)]
*  we did the announcement probably more than a year really and yeah it was 94 95 yeah yeah and part of [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9123.0s)]
*  96 so burt said quite publicly that the genius of x prize was was in the rules and yeah i remember [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9130.6s)]
*  he said the rules are as valid today as they've always been um yeah which was a big compliment [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9140.359999999999s)]
*  you know it was and it i mean burt was as you say it was you know you talked about your your [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9146.68s)]
*  relationship with him i had a similarly stormy relationship um goes back way before x prize [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9154.44s)]
*  because he knew that a good a dear friend of his invited me to meet him and and [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9161.4s)]
*  i think he would have thrown me out if i wasn't with his pal but i had two strikes against me i [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9169.88s)]
*  was there on some nasa business and and brant goesworthy introduced me to him as this is my [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9174.92s)]

*  conversation with him he would needle you and just abuse you and insult you just to have fun just to [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9195.08s)]
*  see what he could do he would poke poke the system yeah he did so so so get having burt say anything [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9201.96s)]
*  good about us as an organization and as as people was was was nice and actually he paid me a [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9207.88s)]
*  compliment when he introduced me to doug shane it was his successor eventually at scale and and [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9214.12s)]
*  we'll tell it doug shane's story later um he said that i was the toughest son of a bitch that he [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9219.720000000001s)]

*  and the pressure and intensity all aside they're having fun and this this you know scaled [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9242.039999999999s)]
*  composites and burt rutan's genius was was to take this new material the the the composite [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9250.039999999999s)]
*  materials and start to redo rethink how we build airplanes so if you look at any one of his [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9257.08s)]
*  airplanes they're all crazy they have wings on the nose they have you know they're upside down [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9264.36s)]
*  this one if you look at it upside down looks like an alien and he was having fun with it [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9269.88s)]
*  and so the you know sort of the red white and blue and the stars and the crazy portals more [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9275.72s)]

*  breakthrough cut from this dodgy old stuck industry that was you know big business and [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9289.96s)]
*  governments and only this way and it struck me that we were rewriting the rules and while [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9298.52s)]
*  x-prize was rewriting the rules we were kind of running around like kids and these people were [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9305.560000000001s)]
*  doing business as old school and and rutan was kind of a part of that but he was an earlier [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9310.44s)]
*  breakthrough yeah and and so we were just pushing all the limits i just thought it was amazing so [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9317.720000000001s)]

*  invited out for what we have since called the x-zero flight this is a flight that mike melville [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9347.48s)]
*  his most seasoned pilot is flying and it's a it's the first time that the vehicle spaceship [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9354.2s)]
*  one is flying with a full tank of nitrous oxide its power source is nitrous oxide and polybutadiene [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9362.84s)]
*  a rubber and it's called a hybrid rocket engine for those who haven't heard of it and and it's [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9371.560000000001s)]
*  going to fly to trying to achieve 100 kilometers altitude greg do you want to tell the story of [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9378.68s)]
*  what what happened on this x-zero flight do you remember or well i'll tell one of the stories so [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9386.12s)]
*  please mike who's an excellent pilot and a dear friend of of bert's was given a box of airspace [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9394.76s)]
*  by the faa to stay within and in the short stories he didn't he there is a there is an illusion of [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9407.88s)]
*  that happens during acceleration and basically mike over pulled and instead of being over mojave [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9417.48s)]
*  he winds up over lancaster california which is far and way out of the box completely safe because [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9425.0s)]
*  he's high enough that he can glide back down they make it to space with only a few hundred feet [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9431.88s)]
*  of altitude so this causes a real interesting situation which is that he's not sure he can win [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9437.64s)]
*  the x-prize with that vehicle and he's to recount the point here greg which is important is he [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9445.96s)]
*  to win the x-prize you have to fly with the weight equivalent of two people in the back seat [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9453.08s)]
*  yeah he was flying without that and you're right he cleared 100 kilometers let's not mix metrics [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9459.32s)]
*  here right 62.5 whatever 62.5 miles he clears by a few hundred feet or to say it differently he [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9465.24s)]
*  clears 100 kilometers by a few hundred meters yeah and it's like holy shit can we can we do this we [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9473.4s)]
*  don't have enough oomph to get there and he starts thinking about maybe i should strap some sidewinder [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9481.32s)]
*  missile motors to this thing and asks us whether or not that's going to fit our rules and our rule [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9487.72s)]
*  said you had to use commercially available tech so our sidewinder missile parts available commercially [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9494.28s)]
*  pretty much not we had some interesting discussions a more fun story was peter and i are at oshkosh and [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9502.36s)]
*  we want to show the funny john stewart bit where he goes portholes damn it we need more portholes [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9509.320000000002s)]

*  of you because it makes fun of his his sideburns and he said oh no they have to do it he's a ham so [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9520.36s)]
*  we got permission what was more interesting is i get a call from our from the insurance company [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9527.480000000001s)]

*  thousand dollars and we'll we'll promote you and they said well actually we noticed that on this [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9554.84s)]
*  flight on june 21st the vehicle is barely made it without the you know uh two was probably 400 [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9561.64s)]
*  pounds in the back and uh you're unlikely your your leading horse is unlikely to win and so we [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9569.72s)]
*  want to make you a deal if you cut back the payout from 10 million to 5 million we'll reduce the [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9576.52s)]
*  altitude requirement from 100 kilometers to 80 kilometers and i'm like uh no freaking way and i [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9583.48s)]

*  bert is and his team are trying to figure out how do we possibly get more oomph to use a technical [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9619.480000000001s)]
*  term and they do they they find out that they can actually pack more nitrous oxide into the uh into [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=9625.720000000001s)]

*  great guy so to to have you know we had we had the royalty of of test flight there [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10074.599999999999s)]
*  for our thing and and uh we learned later neil armstrong was watching it because he was on the [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10081.8s)]
*  board of space.com and our pal dave brody set it up so that that he could watch it so that because [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10087.24s)]
*  he made him stop the board meeting of space.com to watch the flight it was great there was some [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10095.64s)]
*  drama going in the background yeah i'm going to give you that now so it is it is again it's [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10101.32s)]
*  september 29th x1 the first spaceship space space one flight they um uh we have mike millville at [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10107.4s)]
*  the controls and he takes off beautiful takeoff ignites the engines and as he is beginning to [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10116.84s)]
*  climb to altitude all of a sudden we start to see spaceship one begin to roll and it's rolling and [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10125.32s)]
*  it's accelerating and it's accelerating and it's rolling and going up and up and up um and at this [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10133.72s)]
*  point it's there's a hush on the cloud right because the worst thing for the entire space [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10140.279999999999s)]
*  flight industry would be that that they would fail and have a death that would shut down like [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10146.52s)]
*  yes okay space flights only for governments you private guys can't do it properly um and of course [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10153.88s)]
*  he survives that and when he gets out of the atmosphere he's able to use his reaction control [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10162.439999999999s)]
*  system to nullify the flights but it was only because mike millville was so experienced and [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10167.16s)]
*  had the right stuff that he stuck with it you know i remember um pete siebold was supposed to [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10175.08s)]
*  fly that flight he was the third astronaut there were there were three pilots mike brian bennie and [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10181.32s)]
*  pete and pete pulled himself out of the running but in an interview later pete siebel said that [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10187.64s)]
*  yeah he would have definitely just cut the engine as soon as it started spinning and it was only [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10194.279999999999s)]
*  because they didn't cut the engine and they had data for those 29 rolls all the way to space [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10198.84s)]
*  that they were able to figure out what went wrong and how to very simply fix it for the next flight [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10205.8s)]
*  you know any commentary there greg or eric peter i think i was standing next to anusha [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10213.88s)]
*  and we were watching the jumbo tron screen which was kind of blurry because the camera was obviously [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10220.2s)]
*  so far away but we're seeing this rocket trajectory and and it looked to me i mean the crowd went [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10227.48s)]
*  quiet it looked to everybody like the spaceship was coming apart because it was grainy enough and [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10233.08s)]
*  and i remember anusha's hand was on my arm squeezing it like oh my god and everybody got quiet [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10240.44s)]
*  and the whole place was just hushed it was so stunning and we thought this everything leading [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10247.88s)]
*  to now has changed it was like steve austin the six million dollar man who's kind of rainy and the [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10254.36s)]
*  oh and it turned out it was great 29 victory rolls or whatever he said [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10260.52s)]
*  so so uh mike mike wasn't supposed to fly that second flight uh originally [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10269.800000000001s)]
*  but when pete pulled out bird asked his pal if he would do it and he said the only thing a person [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10279.400000000001s)]
*  in his situation could say said i'll ask sally sally's his wife because they knew this is [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10283.800000000001s)]
*  death-defying stuff and sally's a pilot too and they talked it over and he agreed to do it so now [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10289.08s)]
*  mike goes through this death-defying thing and the reason he started spinning was he flew a perfect [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10294.28s)]
*  straight-up trajectory because he didn't want to be out of the box like he was on the last one [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10298.92s)]
*  and he flew it so perfectly that it was like balancing on a pin it was able to he caught a [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10304.36s)]
*  control surface in the last bits of atmosphere and he ran out of he ran out of molecules of air to to [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10310.52s)]
*  so he couldn't null it out until he got into a vacuum but when he came back in he um and he [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10317.08s)]
*  got the the feather back and locked down now now the vehicle now it's just a glider and mike's a [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10326.52s)]
*  really good pilot so he knows he's going to be home safe and sound and paul allen's beautiful [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10332.52s)]
*  alpha jet trainer that they were using for high chase pulls up alongside the the gliding spaceship [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10338.68s)]
*  one and there's a guy in the back seat and he's one of paul allen's guys who shall remain nameless [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10346.2s)]

*  peter you talk about people who reach certain you know level of fame they're afraid of failure to me [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10552.279999999999s)]
*  failure would be not winning but something that from a reputation from just personal guilt would [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10559.0s)]
*  not be good for me was that if uh something that i supported and and sponsored really caused a human [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10566.84s)]
*  life but at the same time and i had said this in many of my interviews before that well people [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10576.36s)]
*  asked me if i would go to space and i always said i would go on a one-way ticket to space i [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10583.400000000001s)]
*  believed in it so much that i was ready to you know give my life to actually go to space so [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10589.0s)]
*  i understood the motivation of everyone who was involved on x-ray side and on the [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10596.44s)]
*  um you know entrepreneurs and innovators who are building the spaceship so it was it was a big [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10603.4s)]
*  burden but it was not lost on me and you did go to space on a russian soryuz not a few handful of [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10609.8s)]
*  years later and but you came back so that was the good news thank god greg how about you and eric [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10617.56s)]
*  i mean eric you risked your your life uh on your transatlantic flight on his 75th anniversary [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10625.88s)]
*  did you feel like your life was at risk at that time um yes although i think you know it's one [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10633.48s)]
*  thing to have personal risk and for me i was risking my own life and greg was worried because [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10641.96s)]
*  he was associated with me right he was being mission control you know the the [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10651.24s)]
*  he was running the whole thing behind the scenes and mission control at the science center and so [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10659.24s)]
*  forth so i felt like it was the right thing to do for me to risk my life but also to take all the [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10663.08s)]
*  risk out of it like grandfather did and and that's why we were successful because we we went at it [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10671.0s)]
*  methodically the x-prize dialogue about what if someone dies was i mean we had a lot of trepidation [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10676.92s)]
*  about that and and in fact i think scaled lost some people in an engine test out in the desert [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10686.28s)]
*  that was later theirs yeah and it affected them for spaceship 2 development deeply oh that's right [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10692.6s)]
*  later but but but but it was a huge question and and i think it it it it this is where x-prize [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10699.56s)]
*  separates itself from everything and this is that we we constantly look at how to create the most [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10707.24s)]
*  leverage and create the right uh conditions for people to risk their development their money etc [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10714.68s)]
*  and leverage that because companies get protective people get protective governments get protective [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10723.0s)]
*  and they can't take those risks anymore that's why they have lockheed's kunk works and phantom [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10730.28s)]
*  works and so forth and the next price has stepped into an entire niche here and that's what we were [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10735.64s)]
*  talking about then as this risk factor we've now sort of taken a whole two whole industries the [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10741.960000000001s)]
*  aerospace industry and the incentive prize industry to a new level to help break through [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10751.4s)]
*  those grand challenges that you mentioned early on in the podcast and eric that's a just to build [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10756.84s)]
*  on what you said it's a very important point because yes we haven't launched an x-prize that [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10763.56s)]
*  puts human life at risk but what we've seen is the teams who compete in x-prizes they put a lot at [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10769.08s)]
*  risk they mortgage their home they put their you know family at at some risk they they put their [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10776.76s)]
*  careers at risk they bet everything because they believe in what they're building and i think [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10783.48s)]
*  at the heart of the ansari x-prize and at the heart of every competition and any successful [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10789.4s)]
*  entrepreneur this is this belief and passion about what they're doing so yes the prize is enough [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10795.32s)]
*  incentive to get them interested and attract them to the competition but it's not the only thing [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10802.039999999999s)]
*  they're not doing it for the money they're doing it because they believe in what they're building [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10809.0s)]
*  and and believe in the purpose of the competition not just the money yeah the great the risk [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10813.88s)]
*  communication around x-prize was actually one of the most important things the reason [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10821.64s)]
*  in terms of in terms of the lasting impact of it [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10829.24s)]
*  it looked to people that were outside of us that that the faa and and related agencies [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10838.44s)]
*  made a huge change in a very short period of time when they came up with the [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10847.720000000001s)]
*  the present space law that exists which was just a few months after we gave away the 10 million [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10851.8s)]
*  dollars the reality was that that those people were with us from the beginning they were standing [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10856.92s)]
*  there on the stage with us in in 1996 they were working with our teams the u.s. teams anyway [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10862.279999999999s)]
*  and around 2000 about the time that we had our our our nadir we were really in in [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10871.48s)]
*  a meeting in washington d.c. put out by the cato institute about about the future of commercial [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10877.4s)]
*  spaceflight and we talked about at that meeting and i noticed a sea change that happened after [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10885.72s)]
*  this discussion we we had a discussion a presentation about what we were doing [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10893.32s)]
*  we showed a comparison with risks that people are willing to take so for example i'll just make up [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10898.92s)]
*  the number because i don't remember the real number every year something like 32 people in [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10904.28s)]
*  america die by skiing into trees we have not seen fit to outlaw either skiing or trees you know [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10909.32s)]
*  people feed their families and they're not allowed to go out to the beach and they're not allowed to [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10917.88s)]
*  we have not seen fit to outlaw either skiing or trees you know people figure it's worth something [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10923.64s)]
*  we're doing when you look at the stuff that when you look at the real risks that society takes [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10930.119999999999s)]
*  what you find out is that the there's a myth about people being risk-averse companies may be [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10935.24s)]
*  risk-averse organizations may be risk-averse but people actually take a lot of risk and actually [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10941.16s)]
*  companies good good companies take a lot of risk too but they mitigate the risk eric's flight was [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10946.84s)]
*  all about and charles's flight were all about risk mitigation in fact the reason [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10952.28s)]
*  lynn charles lindbergh won the ortique prize was he had a superior knowledge of what the real risks [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10958.52s)]
*  were on long flights everybody thought multiple engines big heavy planes were safer but he [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10965.560000000001s)]
*  realized they were not the purpose of that second engine was to get you from where the first engine [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10971.800000000001s)]
*  failed to the scene of the crash he realized it would be safer to to have a smaller airplane [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10977.4s)]
*  and sacrifice everything for fuel yeah and and get margin so so this error this discussion is [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10985.16s)]
*  actually where we had some of the biggest impact first of all to get people to try stuff [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10992.76s)]
*  uh second try new things and secondly to you know but but we were this is not to say we were [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=10997.88s)]
*  callous about it in fact we i'm looking at the x prize credo [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11004.12s)]
*  that the creed that we wrote in 96 do you want to read it for us i do we believe that space [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11008.84s)]
*  flight should be open to all not just an elite cadre of government employees or the ultra rich [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11015.080000000002s)]
*  we believe that commercial forces will bring space flight into a publicly affordable range [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11021.320000000002s)]
*  we will use our best efforts to achieve this goal we believe that the resources of space [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11027.240000000002s)]
*  are the key to enhancing the wealth of all nations and people while preserving and repairing the [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11033.8s)]
*  environment of our home planet we believe this is our duty to our species and our fellow passengers [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11039.96s)]
*  on spaceship earth we believe that the risks involved in human space flight are far outweighed [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11046.359999999999s)]
*  by the benefits to the participant and to humanity we will use our utmost efforts to foster safety for [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11054.119999999999s)]
*  participants observers and the public in all x prize activities and uh we talk about our own [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11061.64s)]
*  standards of conduct i'll skip over it just because it's it's not it's not unusual we finished by saying [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11072.92s)]
*  we believe that a small group of people with passion for a cause can achieve that which has [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11080.039999999999s)]
*  never been attained this is why we stage competitions that challenge issues that matter most [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11084.84s)]
*  so i'm in right in our dna we have risk we have the benefits to everybody by opening space [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11092.199999999999s)]
*  and and you know and what our mission was and and it it actually still fits our [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11101.16s)]
*  you know we're seeing it through the lens of our original goals but it it fits and and i had [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11106.519999999999s)]
*  forgotten that we talked about stage competitions plural in the first one i'm glad that we did [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11113.0s)]
*  we had the seeds there real quick i've been getting the most unusual compliments lately on my skin [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i484FuSHS64&t=11118.84s)]
