# Should AI Be Open Sourced? The Debate That Will Shape Everything w/ Mark Surman | EP #136
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU)
*  For someone who hasn't really captured the idea of open source, what does that mean? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=0.0s)]
*  Most of the things you use today, whether that's made by Google, made by Amazon, made [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=5.16s)]
*  by Meta, or made by some startup, or made by some weird artist, or made by your cousin, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  in most cases there's a bunch of open source underneath it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=16.16s)]
*  What are the motivations for someone to build the open source? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=19.14s)]
*  The mythological early open source motivation was scratch my own itch. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm using a piece of software, it doesn't do the thing I want it to do, so I'm going [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=28.36s)]
*  to modify it or I'm going to build something and like I'm a nerd, I'm going to build the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=32.68s)]
*  thing I want and share it with other nerds. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=36.16s)]
*  And I think that is still a part of it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=37.96s)]
*  Do you believe we actually have privacy? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=40.12s)]
*  Oh, it's such a tricky question. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=42.44s)]
*  We struggle with what is privacy now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=44.12s)]
*  We think privacy, what it means, has got to evolve. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=47.0s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=55.96s)]
*  Today we're going to be talking about the open source movement with Mark Sermon, who's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=56.96s)]
*  the president of Mozilla Foundation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=61.4s)]
*  As president, he leads an effort to drive more open, equitable, and trustworthy internet [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=64.64s)]
*  focusing on advancing ethical AI. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=70.56s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=73.68s)]
*  What does open source mean? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=75.52s)]
*  That's our conversation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=77.44s)]
*  We're going to be diving into a paper they just released called Public AI, Making AI [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=79.4s)]
*  Work for Everyone. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to put the link in the show notes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=86.52s)]
*  And he also put out a paper recently on trustworthy AI. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=89.56s)]
*  I'll put that in the show notes as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  So if you've wondered what open source means, if you've wondered how it's going to impact [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=95.8s)]
*  AI, is llama truly open source? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=100.32s)]
*  You know, dive in with me here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  All right, let's jump into the conversation with Mark. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=106.08s)]
*  And if you like this podcast and the people I'm bringing to you, please subscribe. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=109.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Welcome Mark Sermon. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=115.92s)]
*  Before we get started, I want to share with you the fact that there are incredible breakthroughs [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=116.92s)]
*  coming on the health span and longevity front. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=121.56s)]
*  These technologies are enabling us to extend how long we live, how long we're healthy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=125.14s)]
*  The truth is, a lot of the approaches are in fact cheap or even free. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=130.0s)]
*  And I want to share this with you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=134.34s)]
*  I just wrote a book called Longevity Guidebook that outlines what I've been doing to reverse [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=135.56s)]
*  my biological age, what I've been doing to increase my health, my strength, my energy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=140.06s)]
*  And I want to make this available to my community at cost. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=144.76s)]
*  So Longevity Guidebook.com. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=147.92s)]
*  You can get information or check out the link below. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  All right, let's jump into this episode. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=152.56s)]
*  Mark, good to meet you in person, sort of, in this virtual world we live in. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  Sort of in person, yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=161.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=162.04s)]
*  And I'm in... [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=163.04s)]
*  This is as in person as most life gets these days. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=164.04s)]
*  It's crazy, right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=165.92s)]
*  We forget how convenient it is that we can live this virtualized life. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  And for me to have met you and have this conversation in the past, I would have had to literally [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=174.18s)]
*  jump in an airplane, fly to Toronto, in this case, New York, where you are right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=179.38s)]
*  But we're living in this extraordinary world. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=184.38s)]
*  So this conversation for me is an important one. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=187.24s)]
*  And I think I want to dive deep to understand what you think of as the open source movement. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=190.54s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=198.2s)]
*  Why does it exist? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=199.78s)]
*  What are its advantages? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=202.02s)]
*  And what are the trades, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=203.34s)]
*  We hear about open source a lot. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  I've had conversations in the past with Imaad Mustaq about this, with Elon Musk, with others. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=207.06s)]
*  And as president of Mozilla Foundation, it's an area that you are advocating for. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=213.86s)]
*  Let's jump straight in. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=222.74s)]
*  What is... [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=224.06s)]
*  For someone who hasn't really captured the idea of open source, what does that mean? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=225.06s)]
*  I think at the very top level, it means that for the last 20 years, 25 years, however you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=230.18s)]
*  want to talk about it, as we've started to build out, like billions of us, this digital [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=238.18s)]
*  world, that there is a set of Lego blocks that anybody who's capable of using them or [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  wants to learn how to use them can build something out of. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=249.9s)]
*  I think that's a... [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=252.94s)]
*  I'll define open source in a second, but I think that's really the key piece, is that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=253.94s)]
*  underpinning most of the things you use today, whether that's made by Google, made by Amazon, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=258.1s)]
*  made by Meta, or made by some startup, or made by some weird artist, or made by your [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=264.62s)]
*  cousin, in most cases, there's a bunch of open source underneath it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=269.14s)]
*  And that open source underneath it is the Lego kit that has let so many creative people, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=273.5s)]
*  so many startups go fast because they've got a bunch of stuff they can take for free to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=278.42s)]
*  start building something. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=284.1s)]
*  And then on top of it, they might build something that's closed or they sell to you or whatever. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  So I think in that Lego kit, I mean, there was a recent Harvard study that talks about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=289.5s)]
*  open source over the last 20 years, creating $8 trillion in value. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=294.98s)]
*  And so a critical part of the digital economy we're living in, with the creativity part [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=301.1s)]
*  and the money part of it, come from the fact that we have this Lego kit. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=307.54s)]
*  And so what is... [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=311.98s)]
*  Well, go ahead, Peter. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=313.98s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, so we've got this... [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=314.98s)]
*  I think Lego kit's a great description of it, chunks of software that are available [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=318.82s)]
*  for anyone to use without cost for free. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=323.86s)]
*  Is it always for free? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=330.5s)]
*  Yeah, there's four things that it means. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=331.5s)]
*  And it's not always like always free as in Peter to use an old open source trial. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=334.26s)]
*  It's free as in speech. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=339.22s)]
*  And so the four things that make a piece of software open source are you can use it without [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  any encumbrance, you can use it without paying for it, you can study it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  So that means you can look inside, it's transparent, you can see how it works, you can modify it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=350.34s)]
*  So you can turn something that you pick up into something else and you can share it again. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=356.06s)]
*  So share it again also means you can make money on top of it as long as you're not charging [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=361.05999999999995s)]
*  for the thing itself. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=365.17999999999995s)]
*  And so that's what makes something open source underneath. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=367.26s)]
*  There's a lot of how does that play out in AI debate going on right now and we can get [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=371.26s)]
*  to that too. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=375.82s)]
*  But that's the basics. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=376.82s)]
*  Mark, thanks. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=377.82s)]
*  But let me dig a little bit deeper here because I really want to understand the core motivations [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=378.82s)]
*  and the core principles of open source before we dive into AI, which is equally important [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=382.34s)]
*  there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=387.42s)]
*  So what are the motivations for someone to build the open source software? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=388.42s)]
*  Is it just curiosity and desire to help? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=396.32s)]
*  And then one other part of the question I have, even the open source software that someone [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=401.04s)]
*  is building those Lego blocks right now, those are built using non open source elements, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=404.84s)]
*  right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, at some point you go down and you're saying someone's paying for the bandwidth, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  someone's paying for the compute, someone's paying for the stuff that DARPA spun out and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=418.28s)]
*  then Microsoft took over, right? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=424.28s)]
*  So it's not, as the old principle, it's not turtles all the way down. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=426.65999999999997s)]
*  It's not open source all the way down. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  So there's some open source layers, right? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=434.21999999999997s)]
*  So help me understand that and then the core motivations for people playing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=437.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think it's important and we'll get into this, I'm sure, to distinguish between [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=442.4s)]
*  it costs money and it's open source. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=446.64s)]
*  So all the way down, there's stuff that costs money, including our time is worth something, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=449.02s)]
*  if we're not getting compensated in cash with the bandwidth, they can do the DARPA, all [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=454.4s)]
*  this stuff. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  And in fact, in some ways that cost of building it can either get privatized or can turn into [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  public goods. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=468.79999999999995s)]
*  And so that's the nice thing about the history of DARPA and the internet, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=470.08s)]
*  This big public investment, which turns into these open protocols, not open source, but [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=474.0s)]
*  open protocols, which run the internet, which are public goods. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=478.4s)]
*  And so they actually take public dollars, tax dollars, turn into something that actually [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  is open that everybody gets the benefit from. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=486.8s)]
*  So I think we want to just be careful there. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=489.64000000000004s)]
*  In terms of what are some of their motivations, they really vary. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  So if you think about what are some of those building blocks, Linux or Apache or Firefox [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=496.88s)]
*  or Wikipedia, which is not software, but let's call it open source, it is open source, it's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=501.90000000000003s)]
*  not software. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=506.44s)]
*  Or an OpenAI, open source AI model like Olma from the Allen Institute. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=507.88s)]
*  There's a lot of motivations. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=512.8s)]
*  I think the mythological early open source motivation was scratch my own itch. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=514.6s)]
*  I'm using a piece of software. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=520.28s)]
*  It doesn't do the thing I want it to do. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=522.24s)]
*  So I'm going to modify it or I'm going to build something. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=524.36s)]
*  And like, I'm a nerd. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=526.36s)]
*  I'm going to build the thing I want, share them with other nerds. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=527.68s)]
*  And I think that is still a part of it, right? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=530.08s)]
*  Is like, I just need to make a thing for myself is really the heart of it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=532.16s)]
*  I think Linus Torvalds, when he started Linux, it was some combination of I want a version [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=536.6s)]
*  of Unix that works the way that I want it to work and I'm going to make it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=541.88s)]
*  But then, you know, as you go on, it absolutely is maybe a more collective or corporate or [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=547.4s)]
*  even commercially driven utility. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=553.96s)]
*  It's the scratch my own itch, but at the level of a meta or a Google or an AWS, which is [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=557.2s)]
*  I need a software stack that's going to run my cloud computing platform that I can build [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=564.48s)]
*  a social network on and lowering the cost and increasing the reliability of that is [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=568.96s)]
*  my absolute goal. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't want to care about that thing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  I just want to make sure it works and it costs me as little as possible and that it's as [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  flexible as possible. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=583.36s)]
*  So that's why say something like Linux, which is really under most of the things we use [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=585.6400000000001s)]
*  on the Internet in terms of cloud computing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  All of those companies I just mentioned put huge amounts of money or engineers back into [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=594.36s)]
*  Linux because it's the plumbing. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=598.92s)]
*  And if they all basically collectivize the cost of the plumbing, it becomes the standard. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=601.32s)]
*  It just works. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  It's much cheaper than buying Solaris or Windows NT, which don't exist anymore, but the proprietary [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  things from the past or from building it themselves. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=613.96s)]
*  So I think there's a next level of scratch the itch, which is get the thing I want for [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=616.96s)]
*  cheaper in a way that works for me. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=621.0s)]
*  And collective effort is the way that that works. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  And then there is an end where somebody is really building open source as a business [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=625.68s)]
*  strategy on its own. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=631.04s)]
*  And so I'm Red Hat and I take a lot of stuff that's already been built and leveraging everybody [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=632.92s)]
*  else scratching the itch. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=638.24s)]
*  I'm building some other open source to glue it together so it's easier to use Linux. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=640.12s)]
*  And then I'm charging for software. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=644.8399999999999s)]
*  It's not for software. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=646.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm not charging for software. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm charging for support. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm charging for other kinds of services that allow people to use what's free in a way that's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=650.64s)]
*  more effective. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  So I think you kind of have the personal itch, you have the collective itch or the kind of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  infrastructure play, and then you have an open source business. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=661.3199999999999s)]
*  So it's going to be interesting as we dive into the conversation around AI. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=665.64s)]
*  And I know I'm excited to hear your thoughts. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=670.0s)]
*  You recently wrote a paper called Public AI, Making AI Work for Everyone. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=672.56s)]
*  And I want to dive into that because there's been a lot of advocacy for open source and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=678.14s)]
*  transparency in AI. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=684.7s)]
*  And at the same time, there's been a lot of, how do I put it, giga dollars put into the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=687.58s)]
*  field, a lot of capital flowing in. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=695.38s)]
*  It's an expensive and energy intensive field. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=697.7s)]
*  So I want to understand how the two can coexist. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=701.9s)]
*  How do you make it happen fast enough, safe enough with the proper motivations? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=707.6999999999999s)]
*  And how do you get the smartest people, sort of the meritocracy to work on it with the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=715.1s)]
*  right incentives? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=720.5799999999999s)]
*  So this is going to be our conversation for those listening who want to understand where [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=721.5799999999999s)]
*  we're going to go. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=725.26s)]
*  And I'm going to play both the fan and a skeptic on both sides of the equation, Mark, if you [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=726.8199999999999s)]
*  don't mind. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=732.14s)]
*  Please. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=733.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=734.14s)]
*  You know, I've started, I don't know, seven or eight nonprofits over the years. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=735.62s)]
*  And I've sworn that I'm never going to start another nonprofit. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=743.3s)]
*  And the reason for that is the inefficiency of what I see as nonprofits. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=746.62s)]
*  And you know, I run, I'm executive chairman of the X Prize, which I think is a highly [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=754.78s)]
*  efficient leveraged, you know, we put up, we, you know, since we've launched 30 prizes [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=760.34s)]
*  over 30 years, $600 million in competitions. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=764.94s)]
*  But we've got to just struggle day in and day out to raise the money to convince somebody [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=769.1800000000001s)]
*  either with in kind or time or donations to fund us versus, you know, build a business [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=775.94s)]
*  that is churning, you know, revenues and I reinvest it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=783.34s)]
*  I've had an argument for years that Google, even though it's a for-profit, has done such [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=788.1s)]
*  extraordinary benefits for humanity, making, you know, knowledge, leveling the playing [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=796.02s)]
*  field, making it accessible, democratized and demonetized around the world, that if [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=801.02s)]
*  you tried to create that kind of capability in a nonprofit, I don't think it would, I [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=806.18s)]
*  don't think it would have been possible given the amount of capital needed. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=814.98s)]
*  So how do you, so by the way, you can make the point first off that open source doesn't [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=819.38s)]
*  mean nonprofit, just to begin there. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=823.94s)]
*  You made it for me, Peter. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=826.26s)]
*  You made it for me. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=827.26s)]
*  So, I mean, open source doesn't mean nonprofits. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=828.26s)]
*  If we go back to your original question of like, you know, how does, maybe I'll take [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=830.26s)]
*  as implicit open source compete or provide value or whatnot, you know, in a world where [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=835.62s)]
*  there's so much money on compute, it's so expensive to do this. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=841.6600000000001s)]
*  We need the brightest minds, all of that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=844.62s)]
*  And I think the answer is twofold. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=847.62s)]
*  One, you know, our vision of open source and certainly, you know, public AI, which is this [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=849.62s)]
*  broader concept, which we can get to in a little bit, isn't that it's exclusive from, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=853.98s)]
*  you know, proprietary or closed things. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=859.38s)]
*  Open source has always done well in a world where it is a counterpoint, a compliment, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=861.74s)]
*  right? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=867.7s)]
*  And then there's something actually that comes a little bit later and replaces some commercial [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=868.78s)]
*  innovation. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=872.66s)]
*  So Linux really is the server operating system and you don't have the Solaris's and the Windows [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=873.66s)]
*  NT's. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=878.78s)]
*  And that's because it just becomes such a commonplace thing that it kind of commoditizes [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=879.78s)]
*  as open source. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=883.9399999999999s)]
*  So it's, you know, it's not to say open source exclusively. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=885.38s)]
*  And then on that question, like, how does that get financed or how does it come to be? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=889.5s)]
*  Because it's not going to just be somebody in the basement who's going to create the [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=893.66s)]
*  Linux of the AI era. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=897.7s)]
*  Although lots of those people are doing cool stuff. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=899.9s)]
*  You already see with with Lama, for example, that Meta sees a very clear interest in Nvidia, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=902.78s)]
*  who's helping them and lots of other companies who are in the open source, AI space and IBM [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=910.9s)]
*  us, that the idea of moving early to commoditize and collectivize what is effectively [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=916.14s)]
*  becoming commoditized infrastructure. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=924.98s)]
*  Like a lot of what I mean, I think you see the core innovations of transformers and LLMs [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=927.46s)]
*  are going to become pretty commonplace. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=933.9s)]
*  They become commoditized. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=936.26s)]
*  Isn't it crazy that the world's most powerful technology is effectively free? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=938.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that blows my mind. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=942.58s)]
*  I mean, if you'd gone back a decade and said, listen, you're going to have these things [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=946.1800000000001s)]
*  called large language models and you're going to be able to ask any questions, ask it to [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=949.38s)]
*  create video clips, images, and it's perfect. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=952.54s)]
*  And it's like the world's knowledge is at your fingertips and it's got. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=956.4599999999999s)]
*  And then a company like Meta is actually putting it out there for free, where the others are [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=961.02s)]
*  putting it there for free. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=964.9399999999999s)]
*  How much would you have guessed a decade ago that a license to that for an individual would [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=968.54s)]
*  cost, right? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=973.98s)]
*  I mean, it's insane. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=974.98s)]
*  It's free. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=976.56s)]
*  What's interesting actually is a decade ago, if I'd imagined this technology, I would have [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=977.7199999999999s)]
*  imagined it was free. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=983.52s)]
*  Two years ago, I would not. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=985.16s)]
*  So I think we were actually in a moment as ChachiBT exploded, where it looked like all [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=987.04s)]
*  this stuff was going to be thrown behind APIs. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=992.04s)]
*  Nobody was going to release it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=994.88s)]
*  Because there was a lot of open source that there still is today in AI all the way along. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=997.04s)]
*  It means it's how the innovation moves so fast is you have researchers, scientists talking [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1001.7199999999999s)]
*  to each other, writing papers, sharing their code. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1006.0s)]
*  So 10 years ago, five years ago, I would have imagined there's a lot. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1009.0s)]
*  And I think we got to a moment where really stuff got enclosed and locked down. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1013.0s)]
*  You think about opening AI, taking the transformer paper, innovating, really boxing everything [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1017.68s)]
*  up, productizing it, which is good in terms of end user value, and really move quickly [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1022.72s)]
*  that Llama was able to get out there and provide basically the same thing. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1029.36s)]
*  Because I think you see that Manna is playing the Linux version of that, or the Linux play. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1039.1599999999999s)]
*  I was just saying, what's Zuck's motivation here? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1046.1999999999998s)]
*  Is it catching up? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1048.4799999999998s)]
*  Is it just taking a sort of adjacency that gives him a larger fan base or a different [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1050.28s)]
*  user base? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1059.44s)]
*  Why did he do that? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1061.1399999999999s)]
*  I think Zuck's motivation is the same motivation I put money into Linux is I'm not, if I'm [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1062.32s)]
*  Manna in the LLM business, I'm not trying to be open AI. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1069.2s)]
*  I'm in the metaverse business or the social media business or whatever business they're [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1073.24s)]
*  going to be in. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1077.36s)]
*  I need this current generation of technology to work as reliably and as at a low cost as [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1078.8799999999999s)]
*  possible. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1084.32s)]
*  They put a ton of money in upfront. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1085.32s)]
*  It's a big risk to try to have Llama be the Linux of the LLM era. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1087.8799999999999s)]
*  But then I just saw an interview with Jensen and Zuck where Nvidia is supposedly putting [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1094.52s)]
*  200 engineers into Llama. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1100.52s)]
*  I think the idea is if it becomes the standard, everybody pitches in and it's a kind of Linux [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1102.24s)]
*  play. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1107.76s)]
*  And so that's the motivation. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1108.76s)]
*  I think that the tricky thing about Llama and Manna with that is they've put in this [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1110.44s)]
*  thing that makes Llama in our view not open source, which is this weird license piece [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1115.72s)]
*  that says at 700 million users, it's no longer free for you anymore. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1121.68s)]
*  It's no longer open source. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1125.96s)]
*  And open source licenses don't have those caps. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1128.48s)]
*  It kind of breaks the covenant of open source. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1130.48s)]
*  If Zuck had built Facebook on Linux and when he hit 700 million users, Linus Torvalds [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1134.64s)]
*  shows up in Palo Alto. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1141.44s)]
*  With a bag. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1143.0s)]
*  A giant bag. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1144.32s)]
*  It doesn't work that way. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1147.32s)]
*  And so I actually do think other things will emerge. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1149.32s)]
*  And this actually gets to your question about nonprofits in a second that will be pure play [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1152.92s)]
*  open source and that will actually become the dominant infrastructure. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1158.24s)]
*  Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1162.8s)]
*  If you did, did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Labs, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1164.9199999999998s)]
*  that they spent billions on bio defense weapons, the ability to accurately detect viruses and [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1171.8s)]
*  microbes by reading their RNA? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1177.84s)]
*  Well, a company called Viome exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos Labs to build [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1180.08s)]
*  a platform that can measure your microbiome and the RNA in your blood. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1186.24s)]
*  Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called Full Body Intelligence, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1191.24s)]
*  which collects a few drops of your blood, spit, and stool and can tell you so much about [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1195.92s)]
*  your health. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1200.2s)]
*  They've tested over 700,000 individuals and used their AI models to deliver members' [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1201.2s)]
*  critical health guidance, like what foods you should eat, what foods you shouldn't [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1206.0800000000002s)]
*  eat, as well as your supplements and probiotics, your biological age, and other deep health [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1210.1200000000001s)]
*  insights. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1215.6000000000001s)]
*  And the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1216.6000000000001s)]
*  As reported in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, after just six months of following [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1220.28s)]
*  Viome's recommendations, members reported the following. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1225.24s)]
*  A 36% reduction in depression, a 40% reduction in anxiety, a 30% reduction in diabetes, and [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1228.44s)]
*  a 48% reduction in IBS. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1236.56s)]
*  Listen, I've been using Viome for three years. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1238.8799999999999s)]
*  I know that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1241.36s)]
*  Best of all, Viome is affordable, which is part of my mission to democratize health. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1246.68s)]
*  If you want to join me on this journey, go to Viome.com slash Peter. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1251.76s)]
*  I've asked Naveen Jain, a friend of mine who's the founder and CEO of Viome, to give my listeners [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1255.5600000000002s)]
*  a special discount. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1260.16s)]
*  You'll find it at Viome.com slash Peter. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1261.6000000000001s)]
*  Before we go any further, I'd love you to give us a little bit of a background on Mozilla [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1264.6000000000001s)]
*  Foundation. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1270.0800000000002s)]
*  It's the context in which you come, it's the work that you're doing, and I think folks [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1271.52s)]
*  should have a little background here. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1275.72s)]
*  Please. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1279.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because we get back to that question of motivation. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1280.0400000000002s)]
*  Mozilla started in 1998. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1283.52s)]
*  I wasn't around. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1285.76s)]
*  I was a fanboy from the outside as the open source project on top of the Netscape browser [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1286.76s)]
*  source code. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1294.24s)]
*  So, you know, Netscape was losing to Internet Explorer. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1295.24s)]
*  They'd been the first big browser after Mosaic. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1298.8400000000001s)]
*  I remember it well. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1301.72s)]
*  And so they thought, well, if we put it out there, maybe other people will run with it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1303.08s)]
*  And you did have Red Hat and Sun and IBM, a bunch of other people contributing to the [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1306.96s)]
*  open source version of Netscape, which was called Mozilla. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1312.76s)]
*  But what really drove it was for about five years before Mozilla Foundation even existed, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1317.36s)]
*  it was just really a bunch of hackers around the world trying to beat Microsoft. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1323.0s)]
*  So actually, the motivation question was, these guys stole the web from us. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1328.2s)]
*  They didn't even want to have the web. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1332.5600000000002s)]
*  They didn't believe in it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1336.0s)]
*  And then now that 98% of browser market share, they've got ActiveX, so you can only use web [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1337.68s)]
*  pages really on Windows or inside Internet Explorer. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1343.8400000000001s)]
*  And so there was an army of very angry geeks that said, Microsoft, you don't own the Internet. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1347.68s)]
*  We're going to show you. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1354.0s)]
*  And eventually, it takes them five years. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1355.4s)]
*  They get from this clunky Mozilla browser that was just a kind of a slight meval version [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1358.08s)]
*  of Netscape to Firefox. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1364.68s)]
*  And Firefox is the kind of breakout of like, let's make it small. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1366.84s)]
*  Let's make it sexy for people. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1370.64s)]
*  Let's put in pop-up blockers and let's make sure it does JavaScript really well, which [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1372.04s)]
*  sounds boring today, but was radical because what it became was the thing that allowed [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1376.92s)]
*  people to develop interactive web apps instead of dumb web pages. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1384.76s)]
*  And the joke kind of goes, like, what's the best version of Firefox ever released? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1388.92s)]
*  Internet Explorer 7. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1393.72s)]
*  Because that's the one that had JavaScript in it. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1395.8799999999999s)]
*  And until you had all the browsers working with JavaScript and Ajax, you couldn't do [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1398.2s)]
*  Gmail, you couldn't do Facebook, you couldn't do Twitter. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1403.48s)]
*  So that was the set of people. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1406.68s)]
*  They really wanted the web to be open. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1408.08s)]
*  So Firefox makes an emergence and it takes on market share from Internet Explorer. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1410.04s)]
*  But then Chrome comes along and begins to dominate. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1417.76s)]
*  And what was it that, why didn't Firefox dominate and why did Chrome, what allowed [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1421.72s)]
*  Chrome to come in with such a fury? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1428.2s)]
*  Well, the cheeky second answer to the joke about Firefox is the best version of Firefox [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1430.8s)]
*  ever is Chrome. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1437.0s)]
*  Because really the goal of Mozilla is that the whole system is open. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1439.88s)]
*  And of course, we need to have enough market share, which we don't today with Firefox, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1444.24s)]
*  if you ask me, to be influential in our values. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1448.48s)]
*  So the other thing about Mozilla is it wasn't just that kind of passionate set of people [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1452.88s)]
*  who wanted to counteract Microsoft that only focused on a browser. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1457.76s)]
*  They had a bigger dream. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1462.8000000000002s)]
*  They had the Mozilla Manifesto. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1463.8000000000002s)]
*  And that was really about the internet being in service of all humanity. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1465.66s)]
*  And so the idea is we've got enough openness to shift the market towards being open and [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1469.8200000000002s)]
*  towards the tech working for people. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1476.42s)]
*  And I would say Chrome came as a third real platform after Internet Explorer and Firefox. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1480.38s)]
*  That was a boon. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1487.7s)]
*  There was a period where we really lost the ball in terms of keeping up with the tech. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1489.3400000000001s)]
*  And it's a lesson that is if you want to have this mission, and it's going to be true now [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1495.02s)]
*  in AI, of making sure that the tech has certain values, you also have to be on top of the [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1499.9s)]
*  tech being great. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1506.3799999999999s)]
*  And we didn't always stay on top of that. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1507.3799999999999s)]
*  Isn't it true you also have to be ready for verticalization? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1510.3s)]
*  I mean, Chrome has succeeded as has Gmail, as has Android, and a thousand other things, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1514.3s)]
*  because Google was large enough to verticalize and build interdependencies on these things [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1521.8200000000002s)]
*  that made it super convenient for folks to use. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1529.7s)]
*  And I can imagine we're going to see even more of that with AI in that verticalization, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1534.42s)]
*  that deep stack up and down the user experience. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1540.9s)]
*  It's an interesting question about where verticalization, which is a natural tendency and ultimately [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1544.5s)]
*  monopolization, which is something we don't want and is illegal in our society. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1550.22s)]
*  That's a tendency that will emerge from companies is trying to get as much market share and [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1557.14s)]
*  as many things as possible. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1561.54s)]
*  And disruption interacts, because Microsoft also found to be a monopolist in its era and [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1563.94s)]
*  totally verticalized. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1570.8200000000002s)]
*  They owned the server and the databases. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1572.42s)]
*  They're trying to own the content. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1575.9s)]
*  They certainly owned the browser. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1576.9s)]
*  They owned the office suite. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1577.9s)]
*  And they get disrupted by the web. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1580.46s)]
*  And so one of the interesting questions is the web era and the smartphone era are verticalized [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1583.86s)]
*  as well. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1589.1s)]
*  There's real tendencies towards that verticalization in the AI era. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1590.1s)]
*  Gemini actually, even being late to the game, I think has a real advantage being built into [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1595.54s)]
*  all of the Google suite. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1601.26s)]
*  What will come to disrupt that? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1604.9399999999998s)]
*  And has it gotten so far along that disrupting the verticalization becomes so hard or almost [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1606.98s)]
*  impossible? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1613.3400000000001s)]
*  It's a really critical question right now. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1614.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, I call me cynical, but I think every single company and every single product eventually [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1616.3400000000001s)]
*  becomes disrupted because they become comfortable. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1622.8200000000002s)]
*  I'll never forget about six years ago, Jeff Bezos goes on an investor call and says, yes, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1628.5400000000002s)]
*  in 30 years, Amazon will not exist anymore. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1636.02s)]
*  Or some quote like that, right? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1638.1799999999998s)]
*  Saying, I don't know if he's trying to scare his employees or just dock his stock price, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1640.2199999999998s)]
*  but it's everything gets disrupted, right? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1645.86s)]
*  FedEx, I mean, the dominant overnight carrier as we see what Amazon has built. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1648.3s)]
*  Now one of the questions is, there is a situation where a company, a for-profit company with [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1655.34s)]
*  a great leader, motivated employees just do a better job and they can reinvest and they [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1663.58s)]
*  can, as a meritocracy, just continue to increase their capabilities. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1673.4199999999998s)]
*  And yeah, you don't, I mean, there's a difference between monopolistic behavior and being a [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1680.26s)]
*  monopoly, right? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1684.58s)]
*  If you have the best product in the world and everyone loves it and guess what? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1685.94s)]
*  You know, you've got 99% market share. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1694.22s)]
*  Is that a monopolistic behavior or is it a monopoly or is it, are you just providing [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1698.7s)]
*  a fantastic product and service? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1704.6200000000001s)]
*  This is a tricky question before the courts on a number of topics including search, right? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1707.06s)]
*  It's a great product. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1712.22s)]
*  So I mean, that's, I guess, as we evolve our monopoly laws for us to figure out, ultimately [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1715.14s)]
*  what you want from antitrust regulation is competition and the opportunity for people [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1722.66s)]
*  to come in and disrupt. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1727.26s)]
*  And that's where I know that you're being cynical. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1729.3000000000002s)]
*  I think you're being hopeful when you say ultimately every company is going to disrupt [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1731.5s)]
*  it. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1735.6200000000001s)]
*  No, I believe it because every company gets fat, dumb and happy to some degree and new [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1736.6200000000001s)]
*  technologies constantly, I mean, that's the laws of physics or technology. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1742.38s)]
*  We just have constant, you know, we're in a superexponential period and I say the day [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1748.2600000000002s)]
*  before something is truly a breakthrough, it's a crazy idea. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1755.38s)]
*  And we get disrupted by crazy ideas that a company that's reporting on a quarterly basis [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1759.42s)]
*  is unwilling to take, but some entrepreneur someplace is willing to, they have nothing [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1765.7s)]
*  to lose, so we'll take the bet and oh my God, that's incredible. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1770.86s)]
*  Well, probably maybe five or ten years before, not the day before, and it takes an opening [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1773.46s)]
*  eye from 2015 to, but I think your point is right. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1779.7s)]
*  One of the things I want to pull at, and it goes back to a question I didn't answer earlier, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1784.7s)]
*  but also on this, like, companies are going to want to grow in this way, is there also [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1788.02s)]
*  is a question of disruption to one end, right? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1794.22s)]
*  So some people will come in and disrupt because they've got a great idea, they want to build [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1796.7s)]
*  a company and like capitalism and companies are great at solving certain problems and [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1799.94s)]
*  creating public good and even public goods, you know, things that are shared in common, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1805.1000000000001s)]
*  contributing to Linux, all that stuff. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1809.8200000000002s)]
*  But there also are things to your question, like not starting a non-profit, the companies [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1812.5s)]
*  are just never going to be good at. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1818.5800000000002s)]
*  And so that's where when we talk about public AI as a counterpoint, I don't think that a [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1821.3000000000002s)]
*  company is ever going to be good at what has happened with Linux, which is a collective [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1827.98s)]
*  public good that all the companies who build on it and researchers and everybody in governments [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1832.6200000000001s)]
*  build on top of. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1839.3s)]
*  And for all it's a pain in the ass that Linux Foundation struggles with getting enough members. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1840.3s)]
*  That is a form of social organization that lends itself to being an independent third [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1845.26s)]
*  party. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1851.3400000000001s)]
*  And unless you want to get rid of governments altogether, I mean, that's another form of [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1852.3400000000001s)]
*  social innovation that has its. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1855.78s)]
*  I would call myself a libertarian capitalist. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1858.74s)]
*  So that's where I've been towards. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1861.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1863.46s)]
*  And I'm an old punk anarchist. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1864.46s)]
*  And so, you know, sometimes we'll have some common cause there. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1865.82s)]
*  But I think that the thing is, you know, what social forms of social organization are helpful [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1869.22s)]
*  to what innovation and accelerating what innovation. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1875.34s)]
*  So, you know, do you are we happy that in addition to NBC, ABC, CBS, we also had PBS [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1878.54s)]
*  in the broadcast era and it took on a role that the commercial players were never going [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1887.02s)]
*  to take on. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1892.8999999999999s)]
*  And so to me, the question at any point, but innovation comes in and YouTube comes online. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1894.82s)]
*  Great. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1901.94s)]
*  And you don't need PBS or BBC or CBS. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1902.94s)]
*  And so when we have a government formed provider, right, I would rather have complete and total [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1907.3s)]
*  open access for anybody, provide whatever they want. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1919.26s)]
*  But that comes later in the process. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1923.1s)]
*  And I think the question to always be asking is, what's not going to happen if you just [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1925.66s)]
*  leave it to the market? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1929.98s)]
*  I think that's a very fair and a very important question for humanity's benefit. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1931.74s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1938.94s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1942.3400000000001s)]
*  love. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1947.46s)]
*  The company is called Fountain Life. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1948.46s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1949.46s)]
*  physicians. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1954.9s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1955.9s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1960.06s)]
*  Until that day when you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1961.86s)]
*  room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1965.8999999999999s)]
*  four going on. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1970.1799999999998s)]
*  And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1971.58s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1974.34s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1977.82s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1981.3999999999999s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1986.86s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1991.62s)]
*  CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=1997.82s)]
*  blood workup. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2003.6599999999999s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2005.06s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2008.4199999999998s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2015.26s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2018.34s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2020.3s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2022.6200000000001s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2025.5s)]
*  to your life. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2029.42s)]

*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2077.58s)]
*  So I want to jump into your public AI, making AI work for everyone. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2079.58s)]
*  And I pulled out five points and I'd love to dive into them a little bit. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2085.86s)]
*  I think that entrepreneurs listening to our conversation here, there are a few different [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2091.98s)]
*  debates going on in the AI world. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2100.48s)]
*  One is will digital superintelligence destroy humanity? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2102.3999999999996s)]
*  That's a great debate. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2107.04s)]
*  Not going to have that conversation right now. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2108.04s)]
*  Will it pull all the jobs? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2109.64s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2110.64s)]
*  I'm happy to have it, but thank God we're not having it right now. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2111.64s)]
*  Will AI pull all our jobs? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2114.12s)]
*  Will it help us create longevity and fusion? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2116.7599999999998s)]
*  The answer is yes, but we'll get back to that later. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2121.8799999999997s)]
*  The question of how do we assure safety and transparency and who's responsible for that? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2125.36s)]
*  These are fundamental questions. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2136.32s)]
*  So here's the first point I've written down and let's discuss what this means. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2137.76s)]
*  So AI development is dominated by commercial interests. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2141.48s)]
*  Why is that a bad thing or is that a good thing? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2146.54s)]
*  Well, I think the commercial interests are a part of driving the innovation. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2150.04s)]
*  It is a great thing. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2154.04s)]
*  And you often have these dances, if you think about the internet overall, between non-commercial [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2155.04s)]
*  research like deep innovation. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2163.92s)]
*  So whether that's DARPA and the internet or CERN and the web, you actually figure out [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2166.32s)]
*  what to do with it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2171.88s)]
*  And there's a lot of commercial drivers of innovation from there. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2172.88s)]
*  And then often afterwards, there's a role for what is a commercial player not doing [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2177.16s)]
*  where you take Firefox or Wikipedia or Linux as examples where the nonprofit players come [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2182.44s)]
*  and play a really hugely socially and economically beneficial role. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2189.6s)]
*  So fast forward to today in terms of AI, I think it's great the amount of commercial [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2194.8799999999997s)]
*  innovation that is happening. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2199.72s)]
*  Commercial dominance is a different thing than commercial innovation. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2201.8799999999997s)]
*  And so it's where what we see and want to accelerate is that there also is a public [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2206.08s)]
*  option that complements it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2212.04s)]
*  Not just that kind of motherhood and apple pie, but because it is really important in [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2214.68s)]
*  doing the things we talked about before. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2220.4s)]
*  What won't the market do on its own? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2222.48s)]
*  And so some of the things the market won't do on its own is I don't think it'll pay attention [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2224.98s)]
*  to safety in a way that is actually broad enough for us to be safe. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2230.2599999999998s)]
*  I think people trying to corner the market on safety is actually a dangerous. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2235.72s)]
*  I mean, you might get some good stuff out of it, right? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2240.48s)]
*  But if we actually want to protect humanity, the idea that there's one or two vendors or [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2243.08s)]
*  10 vendors, like cornering the market on safety is a dangerous game for humanity. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2247.9199999999996s)]
*  Having an open where a lot of different players can pitch in on safety, see how stuff works [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2254.12s)]
*  under the hood, I don't think the market is going to drive that on its own. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2258.7799999999997s)]
*  And that's a key piece. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2263.04s)]
*  I agree with you, it's a key piece, but isn't that the role of the government versus open [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2265.36s)]
*  source or any particular company? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2271.88s)]
*  When I think about why governments should exist and where are they not overreaching, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2277.36s)]
*  and this is a delicate balance, safety for the population it represents for me, whether [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2284.52s)]
*  safety from armed forces or police or regulation is like the most fundamental thing I think [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2293.3599999999997s)]
*  a government should provide. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2301.0s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2304.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2306.6s)]
*  And we haven't figured out, although I think we're actually zooming towards it, if the [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2307.6s)]
*  American political system worked at all, it would be easier. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2312.48s)]
*  Having that regulation is the role of government. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2316.2799999999997s)]
*  What are the guardrails? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2320.48s)]
*  You take something like the evolution of transportation. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2321.76s)]
*  I'm happy there are traffic laws and safety laws, and that is the proper role of government. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2325.0s)]
*  And building cars is the proper role of the private sector. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2329.4s)]
*  Public transportation is a thing that sits in between. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2334.92s)]
*  So I agree, providing safety, absolutely, regulating the guardrails on safety, absolutely [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2338.0s)]
*  the role of government. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2343.84s)]
*  Jump to AI, one of the critical things I believe and we believe in those regulations working [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2345.2000000000003s)]
*  is transparency and the ability for people to collectively tackle the safety problems [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2353.36s)]
*  in order to comply with those regulations. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2359.28s)]
*  And so the whole history of open science and everybody looking together to drive AI forward, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2362.28s)]
*  with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow, that old open source principle, to me that's actually [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2369.0s)]
*  more likely going to produce an outcome that lines up with that regulation. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2374.48s)]
*  It's not the government's job to do the implementation. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2379.6s)]
*  On the flip side, on the flip side, having a few people trying to corner the market in [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2383.16s)]
*  compliance with those regulations and what safety is and lock it all down, some of those [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2388.44s)]
*  could be useful players, but I don't think that's enough to keep us safe. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2393.8399999999997s)]
*  My bent again is towards entrepreneurs to solve problems. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2397.3999999999996s)]
*  You mentioned transportation. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2404.12s)]
*  I think about in the space industry, which is my earlier part of my life, it was Lockheed [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2406.12s)]
*  and Boeing, sort of the large defense contractors that were launching humanity into space. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2414.8799999999997s)]
*  And they were dominant by far, right? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2421.08s)]
*  And the government is building the space shuttle under contractors. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2425.64s)]
*  And then here comes Elon as a disruptor and captures 99% of the market, right? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2430.36s)]
*  And the other companies will go. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2435.36s)]
*  The only reason the companies exist is the government likes having a second supplier [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2437.04s)]
*  in place. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2442.32s)]
*  But we'll see relativity space and Bezos with Blue Origin come in and those will become [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2443.52s)]
*  the second suppliers. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2452.56s)]
*  But I don't think you could have ever gotten to the level of innovation and brilliance [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2456.2s)]
*  in a governmental program or a governmentally driven program. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2463.16s)]
*  It was like just getting the very best people on the planet and forcing them or focusing [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2470.8399999999997s)]
*  them to take huge risks and innovation. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2476.48s)]
*  Can you get that speed and energy in open source? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2479.8799999999997s)]
*  Or is it some segments of open source and not others? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2485.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, I think open source and governments are different. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2488.3599999999997s)]
*  So I think the role of governments is either to create guardrails or to fund public goods. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2490.72s)]
*  And so, you think about DARPA, funding public goods. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2495.9599999999996s)]
*  You got a lot of innovation and to some degree speed, although it's a long game, and the [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2499.9199999999996s)]
*  government's playing that funding public goods role. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2505.72s)]
*  You can get that in open source. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2508.88s)]
*  I do think the role of open source often though is after some of the high speed entrepreneurial [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2511.04s)]
*  innovation happens. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2517.16s)]
*  So you see Linux comes like 10 years, a half a generation after Solaris or Windows NT. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2518.84s)]
*  And it's like, we want a different thing. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2524.96s)]
*  We want to collectivize this and make it infrastructure. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2526.7599999999998s)]
*  Firefox comes 10 years after Netscape. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2529.7999999999997s)]
*  Wikipedia comes 10 years after Ncargap. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2533.12s)]
*  If you have one of those CD-ROMs, you get a prize. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2535.7999999999997s)]
*  But I think the role of open source is actually to create often the more malleable public [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2538.7599999999998s)]
*  good version of what has been driven by commercial innovation. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2545.12s)]
*  So on this first point of AI development is dominated by commercial interests, is there... [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2549.8399999999997s)]
*  So that is a truth and is continuing. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2556.3599999999997s)]
*  Should that be dissuaded? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2561.54s)]
*  Should that be... [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2563.62s)]
*  The answer is so what and what do we do about it is the question. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2565.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2569.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2570.3399999999997s)]
*  And the so what is you won't get to the public goods you need in terms of keeping the market [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2571.3399999999997s)]
*  open for smaller players, in terms of researchers, in terms of safety. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2575.1s)]
*  I think you need open source and truly open source that operates in a way that we all [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2578.54s)]
*  have access to and doesn't get cut off at. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2586.42s)]
*  But if the open source... [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2588.8599999999997s)]
*  If the open source... [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2590.3399999999997s)]
*  But let me say why. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2591.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2592.3399999999997s)]
*  And how, if you would, and how that should go about. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2594.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2597.54s)]
*  So the why is things like, maybe I already talked about them, we have the Lego box for [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2598.54s)]
*  this era. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2602.38s)]
*  We've got the ability to have transparency for safety. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2603.38s)]
*  How maybe corporate players actually even drive that. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2606.5s)]
*  And I think them corporate players... [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2611.1400000000003s)]
*  I have a little two by two matrix I have, which is like open, closed, private, commercial, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2612.7400000000002s)]
*  public. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2618.42s)]
*  You see different people kind of down in the commercial but open, you have meta trying [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2619.74s)]
*  to play. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2625.74s)]
*  I think that's good. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2626.74s)]
*  In the long run, I also want to make sure there's stuff that is kind of owned in common. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2627.74s)]
*  So you have people like the Allen Institute, which was set up by Paul Hallam before he [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2631.9s)]
*  died, Allen Institute for AI. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2636.42s)]
*  Which he made the money to fund that from a monopolistic activity. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2638.86s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2643.62s)]
*  You have a tax system that supports philanthropy in America. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2645.38s)]
*  So that's what is supposed to happen. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2648.1s)]
*  So he really believed in open AI. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2652.14s)]
*  He really believed in open source AI. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2656.06s)]
*  And you have an amazing guy, Ali Faradhi, leading that. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2659.42s)]
*  I think that could become the Linux or the Linux foundation of this era. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2662.2999999999997s)]
*  And so both of those are useful players to kind of have out there. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2668.54s)]
*  I do think one of the critical things that we're missing right now is in every Western [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2672.58s)]
*  country you're seeing huge amounts of money being thrown at compute or huge kind of looking [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2678.26s)]
*  at how are we going to deal with energy and AI. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2684.1s)]
*  And to me, we really should make sure that those government dollars go to public goods. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2687.06s)]
*  So if I'm giving you huge amounts of compute as a researcher or even as a company, that [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2692.86s)]
*  should produce open source at the other end of the process. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2698.66s)]
*  If public dollars pay for it, public goods should come out at the other end. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2702.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2705.1s)]
*  E. Mai Mustaq has made a statement which I really liked, which is this is infrastructure. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2706.1s)]
*  This is fundamental. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2711.74s)]
*  The compute is fundamental infrastructure for every country. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2713.62s)]
*  And every country should own its own models and its own infrastructure. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2717.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's going to become oxygen, electricity for a nation. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2721.4599999999996s)]
*  I think it's I agree with him 100% that it's infrastructure and it's not just the [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2727.9s)]
*  computers. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2731.82s)]
*  It's the models. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2732.82s)]
*  It's the whole stack. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2733.82s)]
*  We did a big paper on that with a bunch of other people, including Jan LeCun was a part [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2734.82s)]
*  of it at an event last year or earlier this year. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2739.58s)]
*  And one of the things I would be really careful of is not to think that it's national sovereignty, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2744.82s)]
*  but actually, you know, I think the democracies of the world building the system that is open [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2751.6200000000003s)]
*  to control by them. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2756.82s)]
*  And you're going to have the Spanish language law. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2757.82s)]
*  You can have the Spanish large language model or the Italian or the French or whatever on [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2760.42s)]
*  top of a shared pool of infrastructure, which is effectively built that is open source and [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2766.5800000000004s)]
*  for democracy. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2772.78s)]
*  But I actually think that that infrastructure is something that as a set of countries in [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2773.78s)]
*  the world that have a certain set of values, we want that collectively that we can all [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2779.78s)]
*  lean on. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2783.6600000000003s)]
*  Where do you come out in the discussion like we need to go as rapidly as we can because [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2784.66s)]
*  we're in a fundamental race with China and that fast as we can is going to be, you know, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2790.2999999999997s)]
*  government and investors pumping money into for-profit companies that have employed the [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2798.8999999999996s)]
*  smartest people on the planet. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2803.42s)]
*  And this is a race for the four, you know, the principles of freedom. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2804.8599999999997s)]
*  So I agree, we got to go as fast as we can to build a technological society, including [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2811.06s)]
*  an AI stack that is driven by freedom and pluralism and values that I hold dear. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2815.98s)]
*  And I think private companies are part of it. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2823.58s)]
*  I also think public AI is central to it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2825.5s)]
*  I mean, we talk about public orientation, public use, public goods, and that public [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2827.66s)]
*  orientation is, you know, how do you put the intent of pluralism and democracy into the [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2832.58s)]
*  design of these products and test against it over time, which is about safety, which [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2838.74s)]
*  is about who gets to contribute all those things. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2843.2599999999998s)]
*  There's a great book, or I think it's only a digital book, which maybe that's all that [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2846.22s)]
*  matters right now, by Audrey Tang, who was the digital minister for Taiwan, talking about [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2849.66s)]
*  you actually can build. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2855.9399999999996s)]
*  I mean, you basically have, you know, people who are very focused on private wealth and [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2858.5s)]
*  China, which is very focused on a particular totalitarian approach, shaping AI in their [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2864.54s)]
*  own image. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2870.74s)]
*  And what we don't have is a high speed, fast approach to how do we build democratic, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2871.94s)]
*  pluralistic AI? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2876.46s)]
*  And I'm kind of kind of buy into that. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2877.94s)]
*  Yes, go fast and go fast, not just to back, you know, somebody owning the market in the [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2880.94s)]
*  West, but go fast towards something that is a set of players building something that [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2887.62s)]
*  supports democracy and pluralism. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2892.26s)]
*  And you make money off of it. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2894.5s)]
*  Real quick, I've been getting the most unusual compliments lately on my skin. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2896.0600000000004s)]
*  Truth is, I use a lotion every morning and every night, religiously, called One Skin. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2900.6200000000003s)]
*  It was developed by four PhD women who determined a 10 amino acid sequence that is a syndolytic [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2905.78s)]
*  that kills senile cells in your skin. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2912.88s)]
*  And this literally reverses the age of your skin. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2916.1800000000003s)]
*  I think it's one of the most incredible products. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2919.6s)]
*  I use it all the time. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2921.36s)]
*  If you're interested, check out the show notes. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2923.88s)]
*  I've asked my team to link to it below. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2925.6s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the episode. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2927.32s)]
*  I mean, there is a scenario where companies and the merit talk, the best meritocracies [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2928.96s)]
*  are attracting the very best people with the most capital, the most compute or building [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2937.72s)]
*  the best systems. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2942.36s)]
*  And then the government becomes a user of those systems to support its people. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2943.48s)]
*  In the same way that NASA didn't build Starship, kudos to Elon for Flight 5, but is going to [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2951.08s)]
*  become one of the largest users of Starship. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2958.64s)]
*  So can we deliver on the public good with private models and private companies? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2962.04s)]
*  Yes and there's always going to be stuff that private companies don't do. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2975.96s)]
*  And there are private companies who play totally in a black box, like OpenAI, and private companies [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2982.0s)]
*  that play in a way that for their own interest also benefits the public good and creates [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2988.48s)]
*  public goods like Meta is with Lama. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2993.36s)]
*  So I think you have to take a nuanced view of how do you get to that stuff. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=2998.0s)]
*  And our view is you want both commercial and government and nonprofit or open source community [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3002.96s)]
*  players all pushing towards this kind of pluralistic open and public AI option alongside everything [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3010.16s)]
*  else, not too exclusive. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3017.56s)]
*  Alongside everything else, it's not exclusive. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3020.48s)]
*  I get it and I agree. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3024.2s)]
*  And as long as, again, the government is not mandating, but it's enabling the emergence [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3027.92s)]
*  of those resources, of those open source teams and perspectives and so forth. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3037.56s)]
*  That makes complete sense. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3046.0s)]
*  Can I ask another question? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3049.2000000000003s)]
*  Because I think privacy is one of the main, is a big driver for Mozilla, yes? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3051.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3057.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you believe we actually have privacy? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3059.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh, it's such a tricky question. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3062.32s)]
*  So privacy is a core and it's something like an individual's privacy and security is sacrosanct. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3064.5600000000004s)]
*  It doesn't quite say sacrosanct, but is in the Mozilla Manifesto. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3070.28s)]
*  It's one of the core tenets. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3073.6800000000003s)]
*  And we struggle with what is privacy now because for us, privacy was make a browser that collects [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3075.6s)]
*  no data about anybody and minimize data as much as possible. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3083.52s)]
*  And we all know you can't make digital things now without data. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3088.12s)]
*  I mean, it's as fundamental, more fundamental than code. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3092.9199999999996s)]
*  That's what AI is, right? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3096.6s)]
*  And so what is privacy in that context? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3099.24s)]
*  That's a thing to work through. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3103.48s)]
*  I do think it is built to go back to the question of public orientation or building in values [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3105.04s)]
*  and looking at how you build technology, AI technology that doesn't unduly expose information [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3111.68s)]
*  about you or lets you opt into things that are more private. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3120.48s)]
*  So you see that with Apple Intelligence in trying to do more stuff on device and lean [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3123.7999999999997s)]
*  in that direction where it doesn't mean I'm a completely private individual, but there's [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3128.36s)]
*  some stuff I want to keep close to myself. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3132.92s)]
*  And we've actually funded through Mozilla Ventures, a company who's building the basically [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3135.6s)]
*  the open source equivalent of Apple Intelligence called Flower AI. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3139.92s)]
*  So we think privacy, what it means is got to evolve, it's got to have a lot more to [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3144.36s)]
*  do with sort of how you think about privacy in your physical life, which is, oh, I'm going [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3151.2400000000002s)]
*  to close the blinds or I'm going to talk a little quieter. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3156.36s)]
*  There have to be ways we can express a desire to be seen and less seen in the digital world [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3160.44s)]
*  we're building. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3168.24s)]
*  What hits me is I've got, I'm going to whisper it so she doesn't come alive, you know, Alexa [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3169.24s)]
*  listening, and she's listening all the time. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3175.44s)]
*  I've got Siri here listening all the time. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3179.8399999999997s)]
*  You can have an AI with a camera read my lips from 100 meters away. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3182.0s)]
*  You can shake my hand, grab a couple of skin cells and sequence them. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3187.9s)]
*  So I think to some degree, privacy is an illusion that we like to believe in. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3191.54s)]
*  And the question is... [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3198.98s)]
*  It's one of the reasons we talk about trust and trustworthy AI as well. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3199.98s)]
*  So you can build that into the technology that the stuff is local or the camera is turned [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3202.9s)]
*  off or whatever. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3211.38s)]
*  And do you trust or have enough control yourself to believe that that's true? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3213.78s)]
*  So there's constraints that can be put on all the things you just talked about. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3220.86s)]
*  And a lot of it is either I fully control it, which is pretty hard in today's connected [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3225.02s)]
*  world as you're super technical and willing to kind of put yourself on a very, you know, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3229.9s)]
*  in an island, or you trust the parties that are providing it. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3234.34s)]
*  That's what Apple is good at. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3239.94s)]
*  That's what Mozilla has been good at historically. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3241.2s)]
*  I think we want to be good at in the AI era. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3243.3999999999996s)]
*  We haven't talked a lot about where we're going with our own AI work, but it really [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3246.0s)]
*  is in the trustworthy space and in the open source space, because we think there's a lot [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3249.7999999999997s)]
*  of desire for those things. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3254.6s)]
*  Let's say the next president of the United States comes to you and says, what are the [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3256.9399999999996s)]
*  policies you'd like the White House to enact? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3262.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you have a clear set of recommendations? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3266.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3269.0s)]
*  I mean, at the high level, they're pretty clear. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3270.4s)]
*  Would you share them? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3273.44s)]
*  What's interesting actually is, despite that you can't get anything done, I'm Canadian, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3274.44s)]
*  so I can make fun of the US political system, despite that you can't pass laws, I do think [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3278.16s)]
*  you have a lot of bipartisan commonality on some of these topics. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3283.64s)]
*  And so I think one is the antitrust law works in today's era. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3288.0s)]
*  We haven't figured out how that works, but I think so there's space for entrepreneurs, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3295.44s)]
*  there's space for innovation. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3299.2s)]
*  And I do think that's critical, a critical thing to figure out for this era. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3300.96s)]
*  The second is we figure out what are the right AI and privacy guardrails. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3306.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's where Europe hasn't gotten it perfect, but they have a little bit right in that where [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3312.4399999999996s)]
*  they focused AI regulations on uses of AI. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3318.24s)]
*  It's not let's regulate all AI. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3321.52s)]
*  It's like, if I'm going to use this for something that might be sensitive or dangerous or harmful, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3324.4399999999996s)]
*  let's have guardrails on that. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3329.16s)]
*  So we've got to do a better version, and that's for humanity to figure out, but I think regulating [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3330.44s)]
*  that. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3335.7999999999997s)]
*  And then the third is making sure that that innovation funding is going to public goods, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3336.7999999999997s)]
*  is going to stuff that everybody can use. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3342.3199999999997s)]
*  And frankly also that it's going to regions other than just California and Washington [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3344.48s)]
*  State. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3350.0s)]
*  Because really one of the other things about open source is the idea that people can innovate [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3351.0s)]
*  from anywhere. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3357.2799999999997s)]
*  I think you see not just corporate concentration in a few companies, geographic concentration [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3358.4s)]
*  in a few places. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3363.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think it is an opportunity for government, if it's putting resources out there, to spread [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3364.8s)]
*  them widely. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3369.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but I do, again, go in my aerospace route. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3370.84s)]
*  I remember NASA's space projects would be distributed among 30 congressional districts. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3374.28s)]
*  And companies, strategic policy was to move in a congressional district that had no aerospace [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3382.2000000000003s)]
*  suppliers so they can get the contract, which makes for a lot of inefficiencies. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3388.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3391.7200000000003s)]
*  The good news is that we're talking about, you know, bits not atoms. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3393.44s)]
*  Yes, yeah, for sure. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3396.6400000000003s)]
*  Lots changed from there. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3398.36s)]
*  What are their policies? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3400.88s)]
*  How do you, you know, so the question ultimately is how do we regulate it to make sure we don't [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3402.36s)]
*  have, you know, disastrous outcomes? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3407.32s)]
*  How do we sneak up against AGI, whatever that is, and maybe we've passed it already, or [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3413.44s)]
*  digital superintelligence that disrupts the way of our lives so rapidly that it leaves [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3419.48s)]
*  our head spinning? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3427.8399999999997s)]
*  Do you have any recommendations? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3428.8399999999997s)]
*  There's two answers to that. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3432.88s)]
*  I mean, I think one is just keeping our eye on the ball. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3434.24s)]
*  You know, you saw this in the debates around SB 1047, the AI safety law that knew some [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3437.68s)]
*  veto recently is really the push towards we need to build an evidence-based way to kind [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3444.04s)]
*  of look at where are the real risks and where are they not. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3451.08s)]
*  And it gets back to like, we should be regulating against risks and not just generally against, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3454.04s)]
*  you know, amorphous fears. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3458.96s)]
*  So it's urgent. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3460.72s)]
*  It's important to kind of have regulation that can do that. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3461.72s)]
*  It needs to be grounded in evidence. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3464.08s)]
*  The thing that is actually much trickier to fix, and I don't know how to fix it, is we [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3466.32s)]
*  have a bureaucracy, we have political systems designed for the industrial or even the pre-industrial age. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3470.6800000000003s)]
*  Let's, you know, wrap on a conversation about what your prediction is on open source. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3477.48s)]
*  What is your hope on where this is going to go? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3486.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, my prediction and my hope are the same, and I hope my prediction comes true. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3489.96s)]
*  So my prediction is that there will be a public option, an open source option, and [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3494.8s)]
*  that you'll see both coexisting. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3501.6800000000003s)]
*  But I also think that the infrastructure layer, that the people who are just trying to do [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3503.44s)]
*  the commoditized fundamental stuff will not be the ones who win commercially. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3508.76s)]
*  You know, Netscape doesn't exist anymore. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3514.5600000000004s)]
*  Sun, I don't know if they exist anymore, but certainly they're not the definer of the ecosystem [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3516.6800000000003s)]
*  that they were. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3522.84s)]
*  So I do think that the infrastructure, the building blocks to get back to that Lego kit [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3524.24s)]
*  will be open, and I think that will benefit us all if it can be true from a safety perspective, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3529.3199999999997s)]
*  from an entrepreneurship perspective, from a general creativity innovation perspective. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3535.3599999999997s)]
*  So that is both my hope and my prediction. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3543.3199999999997s)]
*  I guess the hope I layer on top of it is that we can be smart enough that if we're spending [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3546.08s)]
*  public dollars anyways on things like compute, that the government plays a fueling role in [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3551.48s)]
*  this as it did in previous eras, and that that's something it does with intent as opposed [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3557.44s)]
*  to a kind of constraining role in trying to micro-manage things. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3564.44s)]
*  One last aside on here, I just got back from India, which is a nation of 1.41 billion people, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3569.56s)]
*  the largest on the planet, and a nation that I think needs AI for its survival. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3577.16s)]
*  You know, you cannot provide the education and healthcare to the, you know, there's 100 [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3586.0s)]
*  million people that are the tax base for the nation. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3591.24s)]
*  The rest are in some degree of poverty, and the only way you possibly provide health and [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3595.7599999999998s)]
*  education to them at scale is going to be AI on top of, you know, the geo 5G network [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3603.36s)]
*  that's there. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3610.36s)]
*  And then I go to Greece and I meet with some leadership there, and they're like, you know, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3611.96s)]
*  help us get AI going. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3616.6400000000003s)]
*  So for a lot of nations, right, that are not AI-centric today, that are looking and feel [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3618.4s)]
*  and know that they need AI in their nation to compete and survive and thrive, how does [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3626.4s)]
*  the open source movement support them? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3633.4s)]
*  Well, I think that is actually the core of public AI and why we are talking about that [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3635.4s)]
*  beyond just open source, right? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3639.4s)]
*  The three things are public use, public orientation, public goods. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3641.4s)]
*  Public use is like use this stuff to deliver healthcare and education. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3644.4s)]
*  We have to figure out how to do that well, and that's where the public orientation comes [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3648.4s)]
*  in. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3652.4s)]
*  Like build it in a way that is enabling of humans. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3654.4s)]
*  And Darren Akamoglu, I never get his name right, but he just won the Nobel Prize for [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3659.4s)]
*  Economics, talks about machine usefulness, right? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3664.4s)]
*  So like how do we actually make this helpful to humans, to public hands? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3667.4s)]
*  And then the third piece is public goods, and that's where open source comes in. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3672.4s)]
*  It's like let's, as we do these things, build into a commons, and certainly this government [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3675.4s)]
*  should do that so that what India does helps Greece and what America does helps India [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3680.4s)]
*  and that virtuous cycle begins. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3686.4s)]
*  And that's something where the best kind of human progress I think has come from those [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3688.4s)]
*  things all heading up together. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmfK-WUUFLU&t=3694.4s)]
