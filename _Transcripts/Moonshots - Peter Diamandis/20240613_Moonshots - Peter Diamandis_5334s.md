# What Separates Billion-Dollar Companies From Failed Startups w/ Bill Gross | EP #105
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc)
*  You've always talked about how you can really make an impact on the world when you can touch [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=0.0s)]
*  a billion people's lives or make a billion people's lives better. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4.9s)]
*  The chance to reach that many people now with something powerful is insane. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  I celebrate those entrepreneurs like yourself, like Elon Musk, that are willing to like just [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=15.74s)]
*  bet it all over and over and over again. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=21.5s)]
*  Every company is going to be very difficult. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=24.1s)]
*  Do we keep on having the passion for it? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=25.7s)]
*  We have to do that over and over again. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=27.54s)]
*  There's very, very few stories that are just purely up and to the right. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=29.58s)]
*  There's many ways to make the world a better place. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=32.4s)]
*  You can do it by being a teacher, a preacher, you can be a lawyer, you can change rules [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=34.16s)]
*  and laws to make the world different, but you can be an entrepreneur. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=37.64s)]
*  It's a really incredible way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=40.14s)]
*  Everything is going to be hard. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=41.64s)]
*  Since it's going to be hard, may as well do something bigger. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=42.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=45.4s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=46.4s)]
*  I'm about to sit down with Bill Gross, truly one of the most extraordinary moonshot entrepreneurs [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=48.4s)]
*  on the planet. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=54.0s)]
*  When I think of individuals who keep up with folks like Elon Musk, Bill is right there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=55.42s)]
*  He's built over 150 companies, 50 of which have gone public or been acquired. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=60.74s)]
*  He's had over 5,000 ideas over and over again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=66.66s)]
*  He's putting his ideas forward, building them and creating extraordinary entrepreneurial [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=70.32s)]
*  ventures. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=74.56s)]
*  We're going to talk about the 10 lessons he's learned over 50 years of being an entrepreneur [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=75.56s)]
*  that for me is pure gold. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=80.26s)]
*  Let's tune in to Bill Gross, the 10 ideas that help you become a moonshot entrepreneur. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  Bill, it is so amazing to be back here at Idea Lab. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=88.48s)]
*  It's great to have you here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  I had such a blast, literally, for the years that I was here working with you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Again, I just introduced you, but thank you for the work you do. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=99.72s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  You've inspired me a lot. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, and you and me. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=106.76s)]
*  We both have the same mission, which is to have entrepreneurs take on the world's biggest [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=108.12s)]
*  problems. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  I like to say the world's biggest problems, the world's biggest business opportunities. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=114.10000000000001s)]
*  If anything, giving on this podcast today, I'm excited to share your tricks on doing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=118.58000000000001s)]
*  big things, taking moonshots, how to finance those companies, how to give them the highest [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=128.54000000000002s)]
*  probability of success. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=136.06s)]
*  So again, the numbers just blow me away. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=137.66s)]
*  175 startups and how many acquisitions or IPOs? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=140.84s)]
*  We've had 50. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=144.82s)]
*  50. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=145.82s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=146.82s)]
*  I mean, those odds beat across the board what we're seeing in every aspect of the entrepreneurial [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=147.82s)]
*  world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=155.1s)]
*  I'm going to get into a little bit more of your moonshots in a minute because I want [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=158.1s)]
*  what you're most excited about. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  But you and I have kept a secret for 20, 24 years now of our first moonshot that we did [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=168.04s)]
*  together. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=177.6s)]
*  And I want to tell the world about this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=178.6s)]
*  And I want to see if your remembrance of it is the same as mine. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  So I think the story begins with you first on where the idea came from. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=187.72s)]
*  So why don't you tell that part of the story? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=195.72s)]
*  Well, ever since seeing humans land on the moon, I was fascinated with that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=197.24s)]
*  It had a big impact on my life. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=202.4s)]
*  It made many people inspired about math and science. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=204.38s)]
*  How old were you when, on 1969? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=206.96s)]
*  I was 11 years old. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=208.06s)]
*  Okay, and I was nine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=209.06s)]
*  So eight, nine, yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=210.06s)]
*  And my brother was eight. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=211.06s)]
*  Larry and I really, really dreamed of going into space, but of getting back to the moon, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  of owning something from space, anything related to space. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=219.28s)]
*  I remember actually, when eBay launched, I was really excited to go find a moon rock. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=222.24s)]
*  And I started looking to search if there was a moon rock available, but you can't own a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=228.12s)]
*  moon rock. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=231.44s)]
*  But we found out there was an auction where you could buy a patch, a patch of someone [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=232.52s)]
*  who had landed on the moon who had some moon dust in it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  And that was so exciting to even have anything that had been to the moon and back. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=239.8s)]
*  Did you buy it? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=243.16s)]
*  I did get that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=244.16s)]
*  Do you remember how much it cost you back then? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=245.16s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  It was at an auction at Sotheby's in New York, and Larry went there for me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  And it was really, really incredible. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=250.84s)]
*  But the idea of getting back to the moon was so exciting. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=252.8s)]
*  And we're right in the backyard of JPL. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=256.82s)]
*  And the internet was taking off. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=259.52s)]
*  And the idea of having sponsors and advertising and allowing people to control with a joystick, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=261.22s)]
*  the educational possibilities of getting a new generation of kids excited about the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=266.42s)]
*  moon was too compelling to not follow through on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=270.26s)]
*  Just to set the timing here, this is 1999. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=273.86s)]
*  This is the peak of the dot com insanity. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=277.98s)]
*  And the idea of doing something mechanical when everything else was internet only was [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=281.98s)]
*  very, very enticing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=285.82s)]
*  And I'm a mechanical engineer from Caltech. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=286.82s)]
*  And my brother from Caltech as well really thought we could do something like that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=288.46000000000004s)]
*  And then meeting you, we really thought we can pull this off. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  So my end of the story now is I got a call from your brother Larry. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=296.26s)]
*  And I remember exactly where I was. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's like, you know, hi, Peter, Larry Gross here. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  My brother and I want to recruit you to be CEO of one of our companies. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  Now I had not heard of Idealab at that point. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=311.74s)]
*  I'd heard of the Idealab companies. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=313.82s)]
*  But you know, some quick searching got me like, okay, okay, okay, what? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=315.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=323.46s)]
*  The call said we want to do a private mission to the moon. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=324.94s)]
*  I remember flying out to meet Larry in person, meet you, meet Marsha. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=330.14s)]
*  And my memory of that was pulling up to the front here, what, 130 West Union Street, pulling [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=336.14s)]
*  up to the front door in December 1999. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=343.14s)]
*  And I remember seeing Porsches and Lamborghinis and Mercedes double parked too wide, right? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  It's like literally, it was like cars, like these expensive cars all up and down the street. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=355.54s)]
*  And I remember walking in the front door and everyone was running. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=360.7s)]
*  Everyone was running. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=366.14s)]
*  We had a whirl of activity. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=367.74s)]
*  It was such high energy, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=369.12s)]
*  At this dot com, like just pinnacles, running, running, running. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=371.86s)]
*  We were at the center. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=375.66s)]
*  Oh my God, you were at the center. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=376.66s)]
*  I mean, at that point, you know, name some of the companies that you had going on. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=377.78s)]
*  We had Cars Direct, we had eToys.com. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=382.05999999999995s)]
*  We had GoTo that went public. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=385.05999999999995s)]
*  We had City Search that went public. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=386.05999999999995s)]
*  We had Merge with Ticketmaster. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=387.46s)]
*  We were just, it was really crazy times. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=388.78s)]
*  Really, really exciting. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=390.65999999999997s)]
*  But it was like people couldn't walk to the restroom. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  You had to run there to save those microseconds and go work on your business. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=394.02s)]
*  And so we sat down and you're like, I was running the XPrize foundation and Zero G at [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  the time. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=405.82s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=406.86s)]
*  XPrize in 1999, we had not raised the 10 million yet and Zero G had not flown its missions [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=407.86s)]
*  yet. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=415.26s)]
*  We were going through our STC process. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=416.26s)]
*  They would both happen about four years later. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=417.34s)]
*  And you made me a job offer. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=422.5s)]
*  Now, I had never had a job before. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=424.1s)]
*  You know, I was always, as an entrepreneur, doing my own things, but it was like, how [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=425.98s)]
*  do you turn down? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=430.46s)]
*  And so I remember you said, listen, we have a fully funded mission to the moon. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=431.98s)]
*  You had just raised a billion dollars in cash, which was a lot of money back then. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we throw a billion dollars around like it's nothing today. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=443.22s)]
*  And I think you had said, okay, we're going to allocate $60 million to do a private moon [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  mission. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=452.22s)]
*  And I remember your pitch to me was, we're going to do this privately. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=453.22s)]
*  We're going to land on the moon and we're going to send back the signal and people are [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=459.02000000000004s)]
*  going to pay for advertising and pay for rights and we'll carry stuff and sponsorship. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=464.18s)]
*  We'll do this like a sporting event going to the moon. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=469.7s)]
*  Is that what you remember? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=471.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=472.98s)]
*  You were going to get National Geographic to cover it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=473.98s)]
*  We're going to do a making of video. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=475.74s)]
*  We're going to follow all the technology. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=477.24s)]
*  We really wanted to make an educational experience. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you and I had both been so impacted and Larry impacted by the lunar mission. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=481.78000000000003s)]
*  I went home. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=487.42s)]
*  I don't know if you know this. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=490.06s)]
*  I was living in Rockville, Maryland. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=491.5s)]
*  I sold my house in one day. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=493.26000000000005s)]
*  I did not know that. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  I sold my house in one day. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  I literally took the first bid, packed it up and moved to Pasadena. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=497.14000000000004s)]
*  And then we were on a mission to build the team that could privately go to the moon. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=503.98s)]
*  Now, people have to remember this. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=510.54s)]
*  This is before SpaceX, before Blue Origin, before any of these companies were around. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=512.1s)]
*  The idea, let alone of building rockets, but the idea of building a lunar lander and [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=517.26s)]
*  going there. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=524.78s)]
*  And we ended up hiring some of the best talent out of JPL. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=526.42s)]
*  Like you said, just down the block over here, Tony Spear, who had run the Sojourner mission [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=531.62s)]
*  that landed on the moon, right? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=538.22s)]
*  That little cute little robot. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=540.02s)]
*  You put together an amazing team. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=541.5s)]
*  You really put together an amazing team. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=543.02s)]
*  They were so talented. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=544.5s)]
*  They were. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=545.5s)]
*  We had beautiful designs. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=546.62s)]
*  And I remember one day you said to me, Peter, I want to introduce you to somebody who's [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=549.98s)]
*  going to be a great director of photography. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=554.66s)]
*  Do you remember who that was? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=556.78s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=560.46s)]
*  Jim Cameron shows up and... [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=562.46s)]
*  Oh, he had so many ideas for how to make it better. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=565.66s)]
*  Not only was he a director of photography, he had storytelling ideas. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=569.14s)]
*  He said, instead of just one lunar lander, you need to have two little children that [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=572.5s)]
*  move near the mommy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=575.3s)]
*  You have the third-person perspective. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=576.9799999999999s)]
*  And he really drove up our mass budget. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=578.8599999999999s)]
*  But it's incredible to have Jim Cameron in brainstorming sessions with us of what kind [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=584.78s)]
*  of cameras we're going to use and what the positioning was and what we had to do on the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=589.5799999999999s)]
*  moon. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=592.78s)]
*  We didn't even have HD cameras at that time, but he had just invented one. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=595.3s)]
*  Some of the first AC footage was going to come back from the moon because the early [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=598.66s)]
*  pictures from the moon were very grainy, except for the photographs they took, but the actual [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=601.3399999999999s)]
*  live footage was poor. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=604.86s)]
*  So we were going to solve that. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=605.86s)]
*  I remember we decided to keep it under wraps. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=608.38s)]
*  We wanted to keep it a secret for whatever reasons. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=611.5400000000001s)]
*  I guess we wanted to have a big debut moment. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=615.1800000000001s)]
*  And so we didn't tell anybody. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=619.14s)]
*  We didn't announce the company. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=621.82s)]
*  In retrospect, I think we may have had some people out there really come to us if we had [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=624.94s)]
*  known it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=631.46s)]
*  The next thing we had to do was we had to buy rockets. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=633.78s)]
*  We weren't building rockets. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=635.9s)]
*  We were building the landers. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=636.9s)]
*  So we had to go buy rockets. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=637.9s)]
*  So the first rocket we bought was a member from Orbital Science. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=640.36s)]
*  I was in rocket business back then. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=644.14s)]
*  We bought a Taurus. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=646.14s)]
*  Then the size of our lander grew. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  And then we bought a Taurus XL. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=653.5799999999999s)]
*  And then the size of our lander grew. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=656.5s)]
*  We bought an Athena II launch vehicle, which was in storage, which doubled the mass. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=657.94s)]
*  And then our payload grew again. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=663.1s)]
*  And then Larry and I were in Russia shopping for rockets. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=665.4200000000001s)]
*  This is a couple of, like a year or two before Elon went to Russia shopping. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=669.22s)]
*  We bought a Denepper, which is an old ICBM that could launch all the mass we could possibly [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=673.1600000000001s)]
*  want to the lunar surface. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=679.34s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=680.34s)]
*  It was really incredible. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=681.34s)]
*  Then, well, along the way, I remember, okay, you said, Peter, we'll fund this, but I'm [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=684.9000000000001s)]
*  putting the first 12 million. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=694.34s)]
*  And at this point, you'd raised a billion of capital, but you're shepherding the money. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=697.34s)]
*  I think you were back then in the goal of taking ideal out public and you had to buy [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=702.38s)]
*  back public shares. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=706.34s)]
*  And so you said, okay, here's 12 million to start with, and let's go out and raise some [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=708.82s)]
*  money. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=713.1s)]
*  We're out on the road together. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=714.26s)]
*  We had a lot of people this close. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=716.22s)]
*  Yeah, we did. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=717.66s)]
*  People were very interested. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=718.66s)]
*  We had Steven Spielberg involved. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=719.66s)]
*  Yeah, we had a lot of people. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=720.66s)]
*  Having James Cameron and Steven Spielberg on a private mission to the moon, I mean, it [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=721.66s)]
*  doesn't get cooler than that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=724.62s)]
*  I remember going outside and looking up at the full moon. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=726.14s)]
*  It had a completely different meaning. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=728.66s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=731.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=733.0600000000001s)]
*  So it's really a shame it didn't work out, but it was really, really an incredible effort. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=734.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, the reason it worked out was the dot-com crash. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=736.46s)]
*  I'll never forget. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=739.26s)]
*  April of 2001 hit, and you're trying to raise money for what? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=741.1s)]
*  But I think we would have had a good shot. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=750.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=753.86s)]
*  And it's hard as we've seen since then. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=754.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=756.9s)]
*  It's amazing no one has done it since then. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=757.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=758.9s)]
*  On the heels of the company called Blastoff. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=759.9s)]
*  A great name, by the way. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=761.94s)]
*  We had blastoff.com. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=763.34s)]
*  Yeah, blastoff.com. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=764.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=765.34s)]
*  And I like to say blast off, splash down. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=766.34s)]
*  My biggest achievement at the end was not bankrupting the company, but in placing the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=769.62s)]
*  employees. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=775.82s)]
*  I was so proud of placing our employees and putting the assets aside. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=776.82s)]
*  And then, I remember one day, this is April, we have an all-hands meeting. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=783.82s)]
*  You just saw the NASDAQ crash, and we've got to put the company to mouthballs. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=790.5s)]
*  I get a call from you and Larry, and you say, Peter is, I remember it was on my birthday, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=796.46s)]
*  it was May 20th. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=801.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=802.38s)]
*  And you said, there's someone you have to meet. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=803.38s)]
*  And I don't know if you remember this, but I was in a different one, I deal at a conference [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=806.26s)]
*  room here. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=811.6600000000001s)]
*  And the other one over there, and in walks Deo Ressie and Elon Musk. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=812.6600000000001s)]
*  And Elon had just sold PayPal to eBay. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=817.1s)]
*  And we're trying to pitch him on getting involved in this. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=825.02s)]
*  Yeah, incredible. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=828.02s)]
*  Well, there's a great story about this that relates to the bigger story of entrepreneurship [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=829.02s)]
*  and what you started the conversation with. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=834.34s)]
*  There's many ways to make the world a better place. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=836.46s)]
*  You can do it by being a teacher and teach people. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=838.86s)]
*  You can be a preacher, you can be a lawyer, you can change rules and laws to make the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=841.18s)]
*  world different, but you can be an entrepreneur. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=844.86s)]
*  It's a really incredible way. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=847.06s)]
*  As an entrepreneur, you can make your product that gets pulled as opposed to pushing it [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  on people. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=853.3s)]
*  And it's only one of the ways to make the world a better place, but it's a very powerful [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=854.3s)]
*  way. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=857.9s)]
*  And because we had set this company up as an entrepreneurial venture, we were able to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=858.9s)]
*  take some people who are working sort of hourly by the book, getting their job done, and unlock [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=863.74s)]
*  human potential by bringing them to a company where they felt like they're in control. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=871.06s)]
*  They have equity, they have a say in what we do. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=875.26s)]
*  The team you put together was amazing. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=878.7199999999999s)]
*  It was an audacious mission. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=880.2199999999999s)]
*  And it was it was audacious. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=881.54s)]
*  When you get people behind an audacious mission, you can get people to do things that never [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=882.78s)]
*  would have been possible before. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=886.38s)]
*  And that's what I love about entrepreneurship in general. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=887.38s)]
*  You know, one of the one of the lessons I learned and one of the challenges we solved [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=889.38s)]
*  that we've never thought it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=895.9s)]
*  I don't know if you remember what the most difficult part of our mission was. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=897.9s)]
*  I don't. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=902.02s)]
*  It was getting the bandwidth back to the earth. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=903.02s)]
*  For the image quality we wanted. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=906.78s)]
*  And also then getting it distributed. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=908.84s)]
*  So I remember going and meeting with Akamai. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=910.62s)]
*  Remember Akamai back then? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=912.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=913.06s)]
*  Our largest budget item on this mission was one. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=914.06s)]
*  First of all, we had to use the deep space network to get the imagery back from the moon. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=917.54s)]
*  We hadn't negotiated that yet. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=921.4599999999999s)]
*  But once it came back down to JPL or Goddard, wherever it hit the earth, to distribute it [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=922.6199999999999s)]
*  to millions of people back in 1999, 2000. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=928.54s)]
*  Yeah, this is before broadband. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=932.54s)]
*  This is before. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=934.42s)]
*  Way before. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=935.42s)]
*  Before fiber was everywhere. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=936.42s)]
*  It was the budget for distribution was bigger than our launch budget. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=937.42s)]
*  And so we came up with another company, which is what one does here at Idealab, was called [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=942.18s)]
*  Desktop TV. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=946.94s)]
*  It was peer to peer networking. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=949.02s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=951.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=952.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=953.3s)]
*  Well, so many times you have to invent things to make things work, but also sometimes you [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=954.3s)]
*  have to wait for those things to be invented at scale to help you make it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=958.62s)]
*  And that comes back to timing, which is relevant for so many things. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=962.1s)]
*  Yeah, we'll talk about that in a moment. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=965.58s)]
*  One of your brilliant insights. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=967.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'll just say for folks listening, it frustrated me so much that this mission didn't [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=969.7399999999999s)]
*  occur because it was all of us invested so much of our time and reputation and energy. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=976.66s)]
*  And it was just a beloved mission. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=981.06s)]
*  It's like you would work on it for free. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=983.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=984.9799999999999s)]
*  It was like it was a holy calling. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=985.9799999999999s)]
*  That's how people feel when they're working at SpaceX or Blue Origin or XPRIZE and others. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=986.9799999999999s)]
*  I remember after the Ansari XPRIZE got won in 2004, I was up at Googleplex. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=992.78s)]
*  Larry was on our board and Sergey was a benefactor. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=999.5s)]
*  That was such a huge accomplishment. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1003.42s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1004.42s)]
*  I remember the celebrations around that and just seeing the joy on people's faces when [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1005.86s)]
*  that was accomplished. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1009.66s)]
*  Yeah, when someone didn't die. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1010.66s)]
*  Really, really incredible. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1012.66s)]
*  And so Sergey said to me, what do you want to do as the next XPRIZE? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1014.62s)]
*  And I told him about BLASTOFF and I said, I want to do a lunar XPRIZE, a lunar landing. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1018.9s)]
*  And so we took what we were planning to do with BLASTOFF and turned it into an XPRIZE. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1027.1s)]
*  Google put up $30 million and it ran for 10 years. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1031.42s)]
*  They extended it twice and no one had achieved it and they shut it down. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1035.86s)]
*  But four alumni, three have gone to the moon and had an energetic landing. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1039.94s)]
*  I was just saying it that way. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1047.62s)]
*  Unplanned. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1049.26s)]
*  Disassembly. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1050.26s)]
*  The Israeli team went there first. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1051.26s)]
*  We had a Japanese team and the US team. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1054.1399999999999s)]
*  There's another US team going shortly. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1057.34s)]
*  Sort of proving how hard it is. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1061.62s)]
*  It is. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1062.62s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1063.62s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1064.62s)]
*  Well, I remember you said one of the most expensive things was the bandwidth. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1065.62s)]
*  I remember the things when the engineers were talking. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1068.02s)]
*  It was great to listen to those great JPL engineers discuss the details they had to [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1069.8999999999999s)]
*  do. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1073.3799999999999s)]
*  You don't have to worry about thermal expansion from the front to the back or the thing that's [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1074.38s)]
*  in the shade. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1078.1000000000001s)]
*  The part that's in the shade is so cold and the part that's in the sun is so hot. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1079.1000000000001s)]
*  Every little detail you have to worry about when you're in space that you don't have [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1082.8200000000002s)]
*  to worry about on Earth. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1085.66s)]
*  Really, really incredible engineering challenge. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1086.66s)]
*  We can maybe look as we go through your lessons and just give an brilliant DLD talk on the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1089.46s)]
*  10 most important lessons you've learned over 50 years as an entrepreneur. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1096.9s)]
*  You started at the age of 12, right? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1102.34s)]
*  It's pretty damn good. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1105.26s)]
*  I can't wait to talk through them. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1108.06s)]
*  I obviously have experienced all of them in some way, shape or form. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1109.7s)]
*  Yeah, you lived them, right? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1114.3799999999999s)]
*  But they're all made. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1116.54s)]
*  It's a beautiful distillation. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1117.54s)]
*  We'll talk about that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1119.26s)]
*  Maybe we can talk about part of this blast-off mission as an example. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1121.06s)]
*  Then what I'd also like to do is talk about some of your current big moonshots. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1126.5s)]
*  Before we do that, I want to show you a video that you haven't seen yet. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1130.78s)]
*  It's the sizzle reel from blast-off. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1135.98s)]
*  This was done by Bob Weiss. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1140.02s)]
*  Bob was my COO. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1141.66s)]
*  He came out of Hollywood. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1144.58s)]
*  He was a film producer, done the Blues Brothers. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1147.02s)]
*  Anyway, if you don't mind going to the next slide and let's play this video. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1149.66s)]
*  Bob did some of my favorite movies of all time, too. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1155.34s)]
*  Some of my favorite comedies. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1157.18s)]
*  There, here. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1160.74s)]
*  I really didn't know he had made this. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1166.98s)]
*  What if we told you that for the past year, an amazing team of scientists and engineers [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1168.98s)]
*  has been plotting a rendezvous with history? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1173.58s)]
*  What if we told you that this team wants you to be part of their mission? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1177.22s)]
*  And what if we told you that this was all part of a secret government program to go [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1183.78s)]
*  back to the moon for the first time in 30 years? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1189.22s)]
*  We'd be lying. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1192.66s)]
*  We're not the government. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1202.7s)]
*  But we are going to the moon. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1203.7s)]
*  Look at how old the CGI is. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1205.7s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1209.6200000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1212.62s)]
*  Blastoff.com. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1216.54s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1220.86s)]
*  It was what a joyful couple of years that was. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1232.62s)]
*  Amazing team and almost. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1237.08s)]
*  Now the world knows about it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1241.14s)]
*  Great memories. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1242.9s)]
*  So Bill, when you're looking at, I mean, you're ultimately investing your heart and soul, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1244.98s)]
*  your reputation, your capital, investors capital, there has to be some kind of a threshold because [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1252.6200000000001s)]
*  how many, let me put it this way, how many ideas a day and a week and a month do you [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1260.54s)]
*  come up with? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1265.02s)]
*  And then there's got to be a threshold like, this is good enough. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1266.02s)]
*  This is, I need to do this. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1269.34s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1271.78s)]
*  So there's a lot of factors we try and apply, but there have been 5,000 ideas that we narrowed [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1272.78s)]
*  down to only starting 175 companies. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1277.9399999999998s)]
*  So they go through a lot of gates before we decide to start a company. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1280.62s)]
*  And those gates include one, can we find some intellectual property that we feel is unique [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1283.86s)]
*  or novel relative to what everybody else is doing? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1289.2199999999998s)]
*  Will it really advance the state of the art? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1291.74s)]
*  Are we doing something that wouldn't happen otherwise? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1293.1s)]
*  Because we really want to do something that pushes a boundary and not just is repetitive [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1296.1s)]
*  to something else that's out there. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1299.34s)]
*  So that's one criteria that we put things through. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1300.34s)]
*  Another is, does it grow on us? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1302.98s)]
*  Do we keep on having the passion for it? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1304.78s)]
*  Every company is going to be very difficult. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1307.46s)]
*  There's always going to be challenges. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1309.58s)]
*  Anything big and bold is hard to do. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1310.82s)]
*  So we're really, really looking to see if we have the passion to carry through and if [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1312.8999999999999s)]
*  we can find other leaders to have the passion to carry through. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1316.78s)]
*  So take Blastoff as one example. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1318.8999999999999s)]
*  If we hadn't found someone like you, who is equally passionate as we were about it, to [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1321.1s)]
*  take it forward and who could be a leader for it, we couldn't do it. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1325.42s)]
*  So we were looking and I'm really glad that I reached out to you and I'm really glad you [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1328.74s)]
*  said yes. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1331.46s)]
*  But we have to do that over and over again. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1332.46s)]
*  And we can't always find someone like that. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1335.22s)]
*  So a lot of ideas fail because we can't find a team to lead it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1337.78s)]
*  Another criteria, we really want to make sure that other people besides us would invest. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1341.8600000000001s)]
*  So this was the same thing with Blastoff, but it's true for many of our companies. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1346.5800000000002s)]
*  If we could find a company all the way ourselves, we could be deceiving ourselves by falling [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1352.66s)]
*  so in love with that child and no one else will participate with us. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1357.76s)]
*  So we always want to find someone else to help us. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1362.3000000000002s)]
*  And we found that when we find other people to partner with us, the odds of success go [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1364.46s)]
*  up and we're looking at batting averages here of how to get the highest batting average. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1367.6200000000001s)]
*  So take the most percentage chance of a company actually succeeding. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1371.14s)]
*  So we start very early on circulating the idea with people to see if they're excited [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1375.3600000000001s)]
*  about investing in it. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1380.8600000000001s)]
*  If we can't get investor enthusiasm, we start shifting and shaping the idea till we do, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  or we don't go forward with it. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1387.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1389.36s)]
*  I remember you and I hitting the road to all of the large venture funds and trying to find [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1390.36s)]
*  that fit. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1395.62s)]
*  Is it a movie production? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1396.62s)]
*  Is it an educational platform? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1397.62s)]
*  Is it a sponsorship? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1398.62s)]
*  What's the business model for Blastoff that would get investors? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1399.82s)]
*  And in 2002, there was no business model that would do it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1403.2s)]
*  No, definitely a lot of entrepreneurs get frustrated at how many meetings you have to [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1407.56s)]
*  have to sell your idea. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1411.7s)]
*  But there's a few great things about it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1413.38s)]
*  One, you should take every one of those meetings as a way to get better and better at it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1415.06s)]
*  Meaning learn from each of those meetings. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1418.66s)]
*  Learn what the objections are. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1420.42s)]
*  Learn how your storytelling is working. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1421.5s)]
*  You really want to make your idea sound inevitable. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1423.98s)]
*  You actually want your idea to be inevitable, like for the success of it to be inevitable. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1426.8s)]
*  To make it inevitable, a whole bunch of things have to happen, have to come into place to [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1431.6200000000001s)]
*  make that true. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1435.0s)]
*  So learning how to tell the story to make it come across that way is very, very valuable. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  So as much as you don't like spending the time in those meetings, as much as you don't [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1440.6s)]
*  like getting a no and you have to be willing to get a lot of nos to get a yes, it's very, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1444.12s)]
*  very valuable to keep on pitching it. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1448.32s)]
*  And then when you see the support from people, when people are leaning in, when people really [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1449.74s)]
*  like it, then you really know you have something. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1453.1599999999999s)]
*  Let's for reference, if you don't mind, your top three to five moonshot ideas that you're [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1456.4399999999998s)]
*  most excited about now or historically, what are they? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1464.36s)]
*  Well, a moonshot idea that we had a long time ago that was a wild success was helping monetize [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1469.04s)]
*  the internet. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1473.82s)]
*  It was a company called Goto.com. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1474.82s)]
*  Yes, I remember well. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1475.82s)]
*  And that was 1998, so it was a long time ago. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1477.08s)]
*  But it was a moonshot in the sense that it was trying to solve a very big problem of [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1480.04s)]
*  internet monetization. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1485.68s)]
*  It also was a moonshot in the sense that at first people didn't like it, meaning it was [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1487.18s)]
*  objected to. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1492.92s)]
*  And eventually it was actually, people booed at it when I first showed it, like people [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1494.04s)]
*  actually hissed when I showed it on stage. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1497.58s)]
*  It was at TED in 1998 when I showed it. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1499.54s)]
*  But we really felt that it was important. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1502.5s)]
*  And sticking with something when people object to something. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1505.22s)]
*  This was bidding on ad words. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1507.22s)]
*  Yeah, bidding on keywords. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1508.22s)]
*  So bidding on keywords in a search engine. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1509.22s)]
*  This was a time when there were barely banner ads on the web. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1510.22s)]
*  And certainly the idea of having money involved in search was really repellent to some people. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1513.6599999999999s)]
*  But we really felt that was the way to lead to a more efficient market where people wouldn't [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1517.9399999999998s)]
*  spam as much if they could actually bid on the things that were relevant to them. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1522.72s)]
*  So we thought it was important. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1525.9s)]
*  Turned out to be a very impactful company. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1527.9s)]
*  Yeah, it drove Google. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1529.38s)]
*  Yep. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1530.38s)]
*  We're really happy with the outcome of that. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1531.38s)]
*  But then fast forward to today, almost all my work is on climate. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1532.88s)]
*  So I'm really working on new ways to make green hydrogen, new ways to store energy. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1536.52s)]
*  I think storing energy is the final frontier in the following sense. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1540.8200000000002s)]
*  We now can get PV panels, solar panels, that are basically cheaper than windows. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1544.72s)]
*  You can buy a piece of glass that's less than a window at Home Depot that makes electricity. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1550.0400000000002s)]
*  So that's amazing. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1555.42s)]
*  And it makes electricity cheaper than any electrons have been made in all of human [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1556.42s)]
*  history. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1559.88s)]
*  But the problem is, it's only when the sun is shining. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1560.88s)]
*  So if we can now have storage that is cheap enough, batteries are too expensive still, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1563.1000000000001s)]
*  but they're coming down. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1567.02s)]
*  If we can make storage that's cheap enough, then we really can have renewable energy that [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1568.02s)]
*  scales because people want power when they want it. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1570.8600000000001s)]
*  They don't want power only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1573.0600000000002s)]
*  How many energy companies do you have going now? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1575.26s)]
*  We have almost 20 in the overall category of climate mitigation of some form or another. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1577.24s)]
*  And it's really, really important to me. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1582.5600000000002s)]
*  I think it's both important for the world, but it's a huge opportunity. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1584.6s)]
*  I mean, it was a dark correlation between the energy availability to community and its [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1588.48s)]
*  GDP and its health and its education level, everything. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1592.9199999999998s)]
*  And look at what's happening with AI right now. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1596.8799999999999s)]
*  The possibilities are endless. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1599.4399999999998s)]
*  The ability to theoretically spin up a million brains to try and solve a problem, like a [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1602.1599999999999s)]
*  million PhD students you could spin up on servers, but that's going to take a lot of [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1606.8799999999999s)]
*  energy. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1610.9599999999998s)]
*  One of the things I keep thinking about is when are we going to see AI come up with new [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1611.96s)]
*  physics and new chemistry? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1616.44s)]
*  That for me, when it colors between the lines and interpolates, that's going to be fascinating. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1618.96s)]
*  I think it will. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1624.16s)]
*  I think someone showed recently that AI was doing something that people thought it couldn't [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1625.16s)]
*  do, prove geometry theorems, something which is beyond just taking some stuff and putting [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1629.8400000000001s)]
*  it back stochastically, probability-wise. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1635.94s)]
*  So I think we're going to see amazing things in the next five and 10 years, maybe even [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1639.36s)]
*  the next year. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1643.8s)]
*  Yeah, if you think it's moving fast now, we're standing still. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1644.8s)]
*  I've never seen anything move this fast. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1647.6399999999999s)]
*  We think back to the internet rush when I first started IDLAB in 1996, but basically [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1649.4399999999998s)]
*  with the browser in 1993, Netscape's IPO in 1995, things were moving very fast. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1654.12s)]
*  As you said, people were running around the building here, but they were not moving as [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1659.52s)]
*  fast as AI is moving right now. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1662.4799999999998s)]
*  And that's because it's living based on the back of Moore's law, exponentials. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1664.52s)]
*  As you know, everything exponential. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1669.04s)]
*  And it's demonetized and democratized access to the most powerful technology on the planet. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1670.04s)]
*  So entrepreneurs have won. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1673.96s)]
*  So I've been talking about this with folks like we're going to see one in three-person [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1675.72s)]
*  unicorns. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1682.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1683.32s)]
*  And Sam Altman was talking about that recently, too. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1684.32s)]
*  He said we're going to see the first billion-dollar one-person company. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1686.32s)]
*  Well, you've always talked about how you can really make an impact on the world when you [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1690.6399999999999s)]
*  touch a billion people's lives or make a billion people's lives better. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1696.8400000000001s)]
*  The chance to reach that many people now with something powerful is insane. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1700.64s)]
*  Think back to Leonardo da Vinci when he was in Milan and the reach of his brain could [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1705.3200000000002s)]
*  only be as far as his horse would take him. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1711.04s)]
*  If he could make it to Rome in a month or he could make it to Florence. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1713.44s)]
*  But now our brain power is not only magnified by AI, but magnified in reach to eight billion [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1718.1000000000001s)]
*  people at an astonishing pace. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1723.5600000000002s)]
*  So our thoughts can really make a positive difference in the world. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1726.28s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1729.6399999999999s)]
*  Give me three of your energy moonshots right now. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  So one of them is Continuum Renewables, where we're working to store energy. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1734.12s)]
*  Continuum? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1738.2s)]
*  Yeah, continuum. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1739.2s)]
*  And we really want to make very, very low-cost renewable energy storage. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1740.2s)]
*  It's working with a company of ours called Energy Vault, already a public company that's [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1744.02s)]
*  doing gravity short. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1747.6399999999999s)]
*  Energy Vault is using gravity as a storage device, which I love. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1748.6399999999999s)]
*  Energy Vault is building buildings to lift up weights, store that energy. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1751.9s)]
*  Continuum wants to use mountains, so to take existing hills where we don't have to build [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1756.3400000000001s)]
*  the structure. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1760.14s)]
*  So up slopes. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1761.14s)]
*  Up slopes. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1762.14s)]
*  So if you find a steep slope, it's almost no other way to make more cost-effective storage [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1763.14s)]
*  than to take advantage of that. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1766.0600000000002s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1767.0600000000002s)]
*  This is steel on steel still? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1768.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1769.0600000000002s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1770.0600000000002s)]
*  The only thing cheap enough to lift to do gravity storage is either water or dirt. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1771.5400000000002s)]
*  So anything more expensive than dirt is a little bit too expensive. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1776.74s)]
*  So we've come up with a way to compress dirt into blocks that you can lift up. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1779.26s)]
*  Now you need a steel cable to lift them up. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1783.9s)]
*  They're on the spot on the... [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1785.94s)]
*  Oh, it's... [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1786.94s)]
*  A steel cable like a ski lift. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1787.94s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1788.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1789.94s)]
*  So you have like a gondola lift that carries a 40-ton block up the side of a mountain. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1790.94s)]
*  That's really, really cost-effective for storage. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1794.14s)]
*  And I'm looking to scale that like crazy, both here in the US, but in the Middle East, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1795.74s)]
*  in Australia, all around the world. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1799.5s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1801.6200000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1802.6200000000001s)]
*  Talk about physical image, that's incredible. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1803.6200000000001s)]
*  It's almost like it's embarrassing that it was so simple that we didn't come up with [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1805.74s)]
*  it sooner. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1809.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1810.54s)]
*  But the reason is, again, necessity being the mother of invention, if you don't have [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1811.54s)]
*  cheap renewables, there's no reason for this. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1814.58s)]
*  But now that we have very, very cheap renewables, it's important. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1816.86s)]
*  What's another one? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1820.22s)]
*  So HGenium is a company we have that is doing thermochemical hydrogen production. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1821.22s)]
*  So right now, most of the hydrogen, green hydrogen that's made in the world is made [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1825.7s)]
*  with electricity. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1828.5s)]
*  But if you can make hydrogen with heat, it's even more efficient. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1829.5s)]
*  Now, is this the company that was using focused mirrors? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1832.8999999999999s)]
*  It could use that, but it could use any form of high-intensity heat. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1836.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1839.22s)]
*  And I think if you get water to 1000 degrees C, it breaks down. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1840.22s)]
*  You could do amazing things with high temperature. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1843.98s)]
*  The right methodology, this particular one, is using a really clever invention from a [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1847.22s)]
*  professor at Caltech, Mark Davis. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1851.4199999999998s)]
*  He patented it at Caltech. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1853.5s)]
*  We spun it out, formed this company, and it's really, really exciting. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1854.54s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1857.58s)]
*  Really think it can make a big difference. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1858.58s)]
*  And hydrogen, of course, is a storage medium. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1859.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1861.06s)]
*  It is an energy source. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1862.3s)]
*  It's a way of storing energy. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1863.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1865.3s)]
*  What's another one? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1866.3s)]
*  Oh, I have... [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1867.3s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1868.3s)]
*  One more favorite. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1869.3s)]
*  One more favorite child. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1870.3s)]
*  We're looking at building a new way of making buildings that both generate and store their [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1871.82s)]
*  own energy. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1878.22s)]
*  So I want to make a building that could be a residential building. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1879.22s)]
*  This is a new company we have called Energy Tower that I'm working in partnership with [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1882.5s)]
*  the architecture firm SOM, Skidmore, Owens & Merrill out of Chicago. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1886.62s)]
*  They have some great architects. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1891.02s)]
*  And imagine a building that you could live in that both generates from solar awnings [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1893.26s)]
*  and from storage, either gravity or other storage internally, where if you live in this [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1897.56s)]
*  building you're 100% renewable and there's no utility bill. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1901.5s)]
*  Nice. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1904.66s)]
*  And I really think that could be a new way we build our structures to reduce the carbon [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1905.66s)]
*  intensity. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1909.62s)]
*  You know, some of the Abundance 360 members have been talking about, you know, new communities [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1910.62s)]
*  that are demonetizing everything, right? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1917.42s)]
*  So energy is effectively free. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1920.54s)]
*  You know, education is free. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1923.3s)]
*  Health is demonetized. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1926.6599999999999s)]
*  That's a great mission. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1927.6599999999999s)]
*  Even transport is free. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1928.6599999999999s)]
*  That's a great mission. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1929.6599999999999s)]
*  So that you could live for hundreds of dollars a month and everything is made available. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1930.6599999999999s)]
*  And energy is the backbone of all of that. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1937.46s)]
*  If civilization has more cheap green energy at large scale, everything will improve. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1940.02s)]
*  How cheap can it get? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1946.46s)]
*  Where does it sort of asymptotically reach? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1948.7s)]
*  Well right now there are large installations in the Middle East. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1951.7s)]
*  I just got back from COP in December. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1954.74s)]
*  They announced a large installation there where it was 1.4 cents a kilowatt hour for [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1957.26s)]
*  electricity from the sun. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1963.18s)]
*  But including storage? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1965.6200000000001s)]
*  Not including storage. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1966.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1967.6200000000001s)]
*  So it will get below one cent a kilowatt hour soon because of the large scale production [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1968.6200000000001s)]
*  of solar panels around the world. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1972.94s)]
*  So my goal is to add storage to that for only a few cents more. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1974.46s)]
*  So three cents all in. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1977.86s)]
*  If you can get to that, that will be cheaper than burning any fossil fuels for electricity. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1980.26s)]
*  So everybody wants to try and make the economy more electrified. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1984.3s)]
*  Both on transportation, everything should be electrified. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1988.5s)]
*  And if you have cheap electrons to power that, that will really be incredible. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1992.98s)]
*  So be carbon free and less expensive. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1996.02s)]
*  Speaking about cheap electrons and making things cheap, I did a calculation last week [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=1999.06s)]
*  which I'll put out a blog on this shortly. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2003.7s)]
*  If you could take yourself, let's call you 100 kilograms for our numbers and a spacesuit [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2007.8999999999999s)]
*  at 100 kilograms and you could winch yourself up to an orbit of the space station, which [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2012.62s)]
*  is MGH, and then you could accelerate yourself to orbital velocity, which is one half MV [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2018.78s)]
*  squared. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2024.1799999999998s)]
*  And I did the numbers for seven tenths a kilowatt hour all in and you pulled it off the grid. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2025.1799999999998s)]
*  Any idea what it would cost you for you and your spacesuit to go to orbit? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2031.26s)]
*  No, how much? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2034.1399999999999s)]
*  $120. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2035.1399999999999s)]
*  That little? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2036.94s)]
*  $120. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2037.94s)]
*  Of energy? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2038.94s)]
*  Of energy. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2039.94s)]
*  And that's a seven cents a kilowatt hour. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2040.94s)]
*  That's a seven cents. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2041.94s)]
*  Yeah, even less if we can do it with renewables. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2042.94s)]
*  I mean, it's fascinating, right? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2044.94s)]
*  It literally, it's the inefficiency of rockets. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2045.94s)]
*  Well, we need to make a space elevator, we need to do all kinds of things to try and [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2050.1s)]
*  make that more cost effective. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2054.1800000000003s)]
*  But it's an interesting reference number. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2055.1800000000003s)]
*  Let's jump into your DLD lessons if you don't mind. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2059.02s)]
*  And I think that they're in back up one slide here. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2064.06s)]
*  So these are your first 12 ideas, right? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2070.74s)]
*  This is what got Idealab going. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2073.9s)]
*  Yeah, well, the story of the starting of Idealab was I was running a company called Knowledge [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2075.5s)]
*  Adventure from 1991 to 1995 with my brother. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2079.86s)]
*  And we sold that company in 1995 and the internet was taking off like crazy. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2084.38s)]
*  And I brainstormed what ideas I want to start on the internet. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2088.9s)]
*  And we had 25 different ideas. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2091.86s)]
*  We narrowed it down to these 12. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2094.6600000000003s)]
*  And I was trying to pick which one to start. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2096.1800000000003s)]
*  And then I decided I'm going to find a way to do all 12. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2098.5s)]
*  And that was the impetus for Idealab. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2101.86s)]
*  It was let's make a place where we can have shared resources, a separate CEO for each [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2104.1400000000003s)]
*  one of these companies. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2109.7400000000002s)]
*  I will put in an initial capital. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2111.58s)]
*  I will support the companies with everything I've learned about entrepreneurship. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2113.78s)]
*  And we'll find a way to try and make all 12 of these work. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2117.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, it turned out of this first batch of 12, we gave it was a one year experiment, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2120.14s)]
*  actually. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2124.02s)]
*  So it's 28 years now, but it was a one year experiment. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2125.02s)]
*  We raised three and a half million dollars to do a one year experiment, a million dollars [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2127.1s)]
*  for operating expense and $250,000 to put into each company. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2130.02s)]
*  And of these 12, seven of them were able to get financing within the first year beyond [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2135.16s)]
*  the 250 that we put in. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2138.9s)]
*  We made offers to people at the very beginning, very, very low salary offers, but high equity [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2140.3799999999997s)]
*  offers to try and take this money and make it last as far as it could. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2145.14s)]
*  But after one year, seven of them raised additional financing. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2148.62s)]
*  So five of them failed just by running out of money in one year. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2151.06s)]
*  But three of them went on to go public. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2154.2599999999998s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2155.98s)]
*  So that gave us funding to continue operating after that. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2156.98s)]
*  So we ran for a second year, more companies succeeded, ran for a third year. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2159.74s)]
*  And then here we are now, 28 years later, still doing it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2163.66s)]
*  There weren't that many venture studios or incubators back then. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2166.1s)]
*  I don't know if there were any. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2170.74s)]
*  So probably the first. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2171.9s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2173.46s)]
*  It was the first I had heard of. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2174.46s)]
*  Do you call Idealab a venture studio? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2175.7s)]
*  I mean, what category do you put it in? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2178.58s)]
*  Really, we are a studio. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2181.46s)]
*  It was a little bit. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2182.78s)]
*  So Steven Spielberg was an investor in Knowledge Adventure. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2183.78s)]
*  And I used to go brainstorm with him on product ideas for Knowledge Adventure during that [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2186.66s)]
*  period from 1991 to 1995. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2191.7s)]
*  And I watched how he worked as a studio where he'd have multiple movies in progress. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2194.34s)]
*  He either would be an advisor, producer or director of them. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2198.86s)]
*  Some he would step in and direct. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2201.54s)]
*  He was actually producer or advisor, put the teams together to work on them. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2203.06s)]
*  They came to him for advice along the way, the same way I wanted to be advisor to CEOs. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2206.6600000000003s)]
*  I really wanted to emulate that. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2211.5s)]
*  I wanted to be able to spread myself. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2212.82s)]
*  So it was really, it was really fun. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2214.26s)]
*  And he had a beautiful place over in Universal where I would watch how he would do that because [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2215.7400000000002s)]
*  I'd have my meeting with him for half an hour, but I'd see the people came in waiting to [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2219.82s)]
*  go in right before. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2223.06s)]
*  So I really think it's like a studio. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2226.06s)]
*  Each of these companies is like a movie or a production. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2228.78s)]
*  And Idealab was a company that you capitalized yourself, brought outside investors. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2231.58s)]
*  There were seven investors at the very beginning who each put in $500,000. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2238.58s)]
*  Like Howard Morgan. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2241.7799999999997s)]
*  It was Howard Morgan for $500,000, Steven Spielberg, me, a bunch of people. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2242.7799999999997s)]
*  Each put it, Ben Rosen put in the first seven of us. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2246.42s)]
*  And again, that was enough for one year. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2250.02s)]
*  But then the company success enabled us to continue. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2252.06s)]
*  And then the business model, just for folks to understand it, when you started a company, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2254.74s)]
*  one of these companies, what was the economics there? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2260.74s)]
*  You, I think, pretty standardized a quarter million as a capital infusion. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2264.14s)]
*  At the beginning, it was a quarter million. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2268.74s)]
*  Now what we probably do is we spend 50 researching it at first before we start the company. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2271.14s)]
*  Then we might spend another 150 to 250 before we decide to form the company. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2275.54s)]
*  And then we might put in more money when we actually form the company alongside someone [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2279.22s)]
*  else's $1 million. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2282.1s)]
*  And, you know, I don't know if it was standard, but I, when we're doing blast off, it was [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2283.7s)]
*  20% or thereabouts was for the employees. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2290.18s)]
*  I think I did. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2293.54s)]
*  Now it's closer to 50%. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2294.54s)]
*  50%. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2295.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2296.54s)]
*  Usually we want the, not usually, always, we want the team who's taking the company [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2297.54s)]
*  forward. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2301.66s)]
*  I should have argued, I should have negotiated harder. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2302.66s)]
*  The biggest lesson I learned along the way on this front was I'm starting out trying [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2306.4199999999996s)]
*  to take my ideas forward, but it has to become the company's idea. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2311.5s)]
*  It has to become the CEO's idea. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2315.66s)]
*  Now in blast off's case, it did, it became yours. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2317.14s)]
*  We handed it to you and we let you lead the company. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2319.24s)]
*  There were other cases where I felt remiss that why is the CEO taking this company in [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2322.7599999999998s)]
*  a different direction than the way I envisioned originally? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2327.68s)]
*  And then I learned, no, I have to let that happen. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2330.3599999999997s)]
*  That has to be the case. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2332.3999999999996s)]
*  The company has to be majority owned by the people who are running the company. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2333.7599999999998s)]
*  So Idealab almost always becomes a minority shareholder very quickly, but we like that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2336.9599999999996s)]
*  We'd rather have a minority piece, but have the company succeed than try and have a larger [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2341.3599999999997s)]
*  ownership stake, but not have the motivation by the team. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2345.2s)]
*  And then in this building where you're incubating these really early stage, you have shared [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2348.7s)]
*  services which is an amazing part. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2356.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2359.02s)]
*  So we have 25 people sort of in the back office that help the companies with marketing, finances, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2360.02s)]
*  HR, we do their payroll, legal, we take care of all the stuff an entrepreneur doesn't want [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2365.3399999999997s)]
*  to do. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2371.74s)]
*  Yeah, well, that was the inspiration. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2372.74s)]
*  When I was CEO, I was remembering that about 80% of my time was spent on things I didn't [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2375.42s)]
*  think were benefiting the product. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2381.46s)]
*  And 20% of my time was spent with customers and looking at the product and thinking about [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2383.54s)]
*  that. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2386.7000000000003s)]
*  I wanted to flip that. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2387.7000000000003s)]
*  I wanted 80% of my time working on the exciting part and only 20%. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2388.7000000000003s)]
*  So I tried to make Idealab solve that problem for CEOs, where when they come in, you don't [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2391.86s)]
*  have to worry about that stuff. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2395.98s)]
*  Like when you were running Blastoff, we had bookkeeping taking care of for you. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2397.2200000000003s)]
*  We had all the healthcare plans taking care of for you, option plans, all that stuff we [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2400.7s)]
*  took care of. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2404.4199999999996s)]
*  We took care of the rent, the building, all that stuff. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2405.4199999999996s)]
*  And I was buying rockets. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2407.8199999999997s)]
*  You were off in Russia buying rockets. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2408.8199999999997s)]
*  Everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2411.8199999999997s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2414.8199999999997s)]
*  love. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2420.18s)]
*  Company is called Fountain Life. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2421.18s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2422.18s)]
*  physicians. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2427.4199999999996s)]
*  Most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2428.82s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2432.54s)]
*  Until that day where you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2434.38s)]
*  room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2438.42s)]
*  four going on. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2442.7000000000003s)]
*  And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2444.1s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2446.86s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2450.36s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2453.94s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2459.4s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2464.18s)]

*  We have 350 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2481.02s)]
*  disease at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2486.98s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2490.9s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2492.82s)]

*  When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2515.76s)]

*  family, the CEOs of my companies, my friends. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2534.7799999999997s)]
*  It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2538.58s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2543.9s)]
*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2546.62s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2550.18s)]
*  If you're going back in time and we're starting Idealab again, would you do anything different? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2552.16s)]
*  What do you learn in that 20 something years? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2558.56s)]
*  Probably the biggest lesson I learn, we'll talk about making bold entries. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2560.7s)]
*  I would probably focus on fewer, bigger impact companies, which is what I do now. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2564.98s)]
*  Now it took me a while to learn that. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2569.98s)]
*  I learned how hard it was to make every company succeed. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2571.46s)]
*  So it's better to make each effort bolder, more impactful and do fewer of them. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2574.94s)]
*  Love it. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2580.5s)]
*  I want to talk about one more thing that jump at your lessons unless it's one of them, which [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2582.18s)]
*  is it must be a challenge to get the right CEO. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2586.26s)]
*  Oh, that's the biggest challenge. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2591.1400000000003s)]
*  It's more important than, well, we'll talk about timing. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2594.7000000000003s)]
*  It's more important than anything. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2598.82s)]
*  So how do you find the CEOs? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2599.82s)]
*  Are you constantly searching? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2602.1400000000003s)]
*  Constantly searching. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2603.42s)]
*  How big is your recruiting team? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2604.98s)]
*  So we have a big recruiting team. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2606.1800000000003s)]
*  We also work with recruiters, but I go to conferences and whenever I see people that [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2607.42s)]
*  I'm excited about, I just start talking about ideas. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2610.94s)]
*  When I see someone lean in the way you did on blast off, we want to find someone who's [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2613.74s)]
*  going to sell their house. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2617.8599999999997s)]
*  So we're looking for someone who, after I told them a bunch of ideas, calls me back [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2621.8599999999997s)]
*  sometime in the next week and says, I can't sleep anymore. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2626.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm thinking about that idea so much. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2629.2599999999998s)]
*  And if that happens, but that takes a lot of, you have to take a lot of shots on goal [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2631.4199999999996s)]
*  to find, to make that happen because the odds of connecting with someone perfectly, the [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2635.3399999999997s)]
*  odds of them being at the right time in their life, the odds of them falling in love with [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2641.3s)]
*  my idea and then making it theirs. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2644.94s)]
*  But now we learn how we have to let them make it theirs. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2646.7400000000002s)]
*  Does someone come to you and say, I have this great idea. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2649.26s)]
*  I'd love to incubate it at Idealab? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2651.1800000000003s)]
*  Usually we don't do that. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2653.44s)]
*  Have you done it? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2654.44s)]
*  We've done it a few times. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2655.44s)]
*  Usually if they come to us with a great idea, which is either very close or almost exactly [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2657.1800000000003s)]
*  the same as something we already wanted to do. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2661.6200000000003s)]
*  And the reason is I've already got 50 things I'm trying to do. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2663.54s)]
*  I don't have the time to put into another one that is not one. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2666.78s)]
*  So people want that and there should be a company to do that, but it's not us. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2670.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2675.2200000000003s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2676.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2677.2200000000003s)]
*  But that's actually more what YC does. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2678.2200000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2679.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2680.2200000000003s)]
*  So VCs and YC and other incubators take inbound ideas and then pick the ones they want to [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2681.2200000000003s)]
*  work on. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2687.38s)]
*  We are more the other way. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2688.38s)]
*  We have outbound ideas and we pick the people who want to take them forward for us. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2689.5200000000004s)]
*  You have 4,850 ideas. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2693.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2694.46s)]
*  On the list. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2695.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2696.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2697.46s)]
*  Let's go on to the first year. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2698.46s)]
*  So the first lesson of the most valuable ones I learned was a challenge in the status quo, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2699.46s)]
*  being bold. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2706.7s)]
*  And we've talked about that already. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2707.7s)]
*  And what I would say, we love this quote so much from Schopenhauer, we have it on the [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2709.34s)]
*  building when you walk in, that all truth passes through three stages. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2712.78s)]
*  First, it's ridiculed, often ridiculed. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2716.7s)]
*  Second, it's violently opposed. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2718.42s)]
*  So when does the idea get opposed? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2720.3s)]
*  When it starts getting some traction and you start threatening some incumbents, your ideas [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2721.3s)]
*  often get opposed and you have to make it through that stage. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2725.5s)]
*  If you make it through those two stages, then your idea becomes self-evident and then you've [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2728.42s)]
*  actually changed the world because now you've made something happen that wasn't going to [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2733.02s)]
*  happen otherwise because if it was first ridiculed and then opposed, it means other people gave [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2735.94s)]
*  up and if you make it happen. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2740.2200000000003s)]
*  So I really love when we have a contrarian idea that some people oppose, some people [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2742.14s)]
*  laugh at, but we have enough conviction that it's important that we carry forward. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2748.54s)]
*  GoTo was the example of that I told you then. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2752.46s)]
*  But even the gravity storage that I'm working on now, there are a lot of people who think [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2754.2400000000002s)]
*  that's a crazy idea. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2758.22s)]
*  Your quote comes up to me all the time. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2760.02s)]
*  And they before something is truly a breakthrough, it's a crazy idea. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2762.8999999999996s)]
*  And I took that from Burt Rutan. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2764.7s)]
*  I love it. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2768.58s)]
*  I live that. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2769.58s)]
*  And convincing people to follow you when it's still in the crazy idea phase is a challenge. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2771.54s)]
*  But then when it becomes a breakthrough, people are like, oh, it always seems obvious to them [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2777.9199999999996s)]
*  after it's a breakthrough. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2782.06s)]
*  Yes, right. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2783.06s)]
*  Success has many parents, failure has one. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2784.46s)]
*  And that's one of the lessons I really want the entrepreneurs, I'll call them, much entrepreneurs [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2788.58s)]
*  listening. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2794.06s)]
*  The amount of work you need to do to take on a big, bold, meaningful effort and just [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2795.66s)]
*  something to try and make money, a lot of times can be the same. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2801.5s)]
*  It almost is always. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2805.22s)]
*  Basically, anything is going to have a trough of despair in the middle. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2807.14s)]
*  We'll get to that story later. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2810.7s)]
*  Everything is going to be hard. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2813.2s)]
*  Walt Disney had it hard. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2815.04s)]
*  Steve Jobs had it hard. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2816.3599999999997s)]
*  They got fired, had to come back to his company. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2817.7599999999998s)]
*  Walt Disney was practically broke when he was trying to make Disneyland happen. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2820.2799999999997s)]
*  I remember a famous quote. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2823.24s)]
*  He said, I owe $50 million. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2825.48s)]
*  I must be rich. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2826.96s)]
*  I didn't hear that one, but that's a great one. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2827.96s)]
*  But it's going to be hard. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2831.2s)]
*  There's very, very few stories that are just purely up and to the right. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2833.48s)]
*  You often hear it told that way mistakenly. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2837.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2839.24s)]
*  What you don't know, it was an overnight success after 11 years of hard work. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2840.2799999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2844.2799999999997s)]
*  Since it's going to be hard, may as well do something bigger. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2845.2799999999997s)]
*  May as well do something you really care about. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2847.6s)]
*  Now, doing something you really care about that's important, is valuable. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2849.72s)]
*  It doesn't have to be so controversial. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2852.3999999999996s)]
*  Making it be bold, this is so good because making it be bold not only means you're making [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2856.64s)]
*  a bigger impact, but sometimes you actually have more success by being bold because you [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2863.3599999999997s)]
*  need to stand out anyway. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2868.4399999999996s)]
*  So it's almost like a few haters are okay because the boldness will win people over, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2870.4s)]
*  both recruits to your company, investors if you tell the story properly, but to make the [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2876.8s)]
*  bigger impact. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2882.1200000000003s)]
*  So I really feel... [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2883.1200000000003s)]
*  I could not agree more. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2884.36s)]
*  It's why I named my own fund capital just after my book. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2886.96s)]
*  But one of the things I realized early on is when you have an idea, and you've said [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2892.7200000000003s)]
*  this before, the idea, the value, the amount of work coming up with the idea compared to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2899.24s)]
*  the amount of work it takes to actually build a successful company, marginalizes to zero. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2906.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2910.4399999999996s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2911.4399999999996s)]
*  It's 1%, 99%. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2912.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2913.4399999999996s)]
*  Not only is there 99% of the work after coming up with the idea, and that's why I often encourage [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2914.4399999999996s)]
*  people too, and people are often resistant about this, just start telling your idea to [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2918.64s)]
*  everybody. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2922.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2923.04s)]
*  Don't keep it secret. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2924.04s)]
*  Yeah, tell your idea to everybody. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2925.04s)]
*  Because people will tell you, I tried it, it failed for these reasons, learn from them. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2926.04s)]
*  So you have to have a thick skin to take the criticism on it, but tell your idea to everybody. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2929.84s)]
*  You don't have to worry about someone stealing your idea. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2933.96s)]
*  Now you still should try to protect it in any way you can also, but you shouldn't worry [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2937.2s)]
*  about telling people. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2941.2s)]
*  It's more valuable to tell people and get the lessons from that than the risk. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2942.2s)]
*  But definitely it's 1% of the idea. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2946.8s)]
*  The reason it's 99% after is not only all the hard work, but the iterations you're going [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2950.16s)]
*  to make. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2953.56s)]
*  You're going to take a winding path, and we'll get to a slide on iteration in a moment. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2954.56s)]
*  Your idea is not going to be the same. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2957.16s)]
*  When it sees the light of day, the great quote from Mike Tyson about everybody has a plan [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2959.2s)]
*  until they get punched in the face. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2965.52s)]
*  I never thought I'd be quoting Mike Tyson in the business situation, but it's totally [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2966.52s)]
*  true. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2970.7999999999997s)]
*  Your business idea gets punched in the face, metaphorically, when you go out and bring [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2971.7999999999997s)]
*  it to the market, when you bring it to investors, when you bring it to customers. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2975.68s)]
*  And that getting punched in the face is how you adjust your match, how you adapt. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2978.7999999999997s)]
*  And adaptability is everything. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2983.72s)]
*  It's everything. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2986.0s)]
*  It's everything. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2987.0s)]
*  So I wish there were a way someone in an interview, you could just see their adaptability score [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2988.0s)]
*  right there. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2992.76s)]
*  Like if only you had a, like SATs don't tell you that. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2993.76s)]
*  Grade point average in when you were at school doesn't tell you adaptability. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2996.2000000000003s)]
*  But adaptability is a very, very valuable thing. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=2998.92s)]
*  It's what allowed mammals to survive over dinosaurs. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3001.1000000000004s)]
*  I liken the asteroid impact as exponential tech hitting the world right now. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3005.2000000000003s)]
*  Everything's changing so fast that unless you're adaptable, you're not going to make [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3011.1200000000003s)]
*  What's lesson number two? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3015.7200000000003s)]
*  So I do have your quote in there. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3017.7200000000003s)]
*  Day before something's a breakthrough, it's a crazy idea. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3019.76s)]
*  I have it right there in my deck. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3022.2000000000003s)]
*  I just love that so much. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3023.92s)]
*  But definitely this just reiterating this last point. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3025.28s)]
*  Something that's just incremental is maybe straightforward, but not going to be as rewarding [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3029.28s)]
*  both psychologically and probably financially. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3034.76s)]
*  But doing something like going from vacuum to silicon, that's a breakthrough. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3037.46s)]
*  That's a big change, a step function that really can make the world different. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3041.0s)]
*  The other thing which is true is when you have an idea, you gloss over the problems. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3043.44s)]
*  And the closer you get, the more you see the blemishes and the issues that you have to [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3050.84s)]
*  overcome. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3055.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's going to be no matter what you're doing. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3056.76s)]
*  And so unless what I, the terminology I use is unless it's related to your massive transformative [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3058.7200000000003s)]
*  purpose, right? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3063.84s)]
*  What wakes up in the morning keeps you going. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3064.84s)]
*  It captures your shower time. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3066.32s)]
*  You're going to give up because you don't care about it enough. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3068.36s)]
*  Next lesson, use naysayers as rocket fuel. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3072.12s)]
*  So this quote from Coco after she won the US Open last year, I was practically getting [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3074.96s)]
*  goosebumps when I heard her say this. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3080.96s)]
*  She got up and the microphone mid-court and said, I really want to thank the people who [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3083.08s)]
*  didn't believe in me. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3087.32s)]
*  You weren't pouring water on my fire. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3089.04s)]
*  You were giving me rocket fuel. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3091.16s)]
*  And you're pouring fuel on my fire. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3093.64s)]
*  And if you're going to do something bold, you're going to have naysayers. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3095.64s)]
*  So you need to find a way to turn that into positive motivation and not be brought down [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3099.76s)]
*  by it. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3105.0800000000004s)]
*  And I just love that because I try to live that. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3106.4s)]
*  But she said it so well. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3109.7200000000003s)]
*  And I really got goosebumps when she said that. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3111.42s)]
*  I define expert as someone who can tell you exactly how it can't be done. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3113.28s)]
*  So I just love this. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3118.44s)]
*  And I live that. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3119.6400000000003s)]
*  I lived through the dot com crash. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3120.88s)]
*  I remember this. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3122.4s)]
*  I remember this is a month before the dot com crash. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3123.4s)]
*  So people were making fun of us. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3127.64s)]
*  People were saying, Bill, you're crazy. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3131.16s)]
*  Entrepreneurship is over. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3133.16s)]
*  Don't you understand? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3134.16s)]
*  There's not be entrepreneurship anymore. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3134.7999999999997s)]
*  People were actually saying. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3136.4799999999996s)]
*  I love that Enron overpriced it. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3137.4399999999996s)]
*  Yep. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3140.8399999999997s)]
*  So the arrows that were thrown at us, we had to persevere through it. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3142.8799999999997s)]
*  And people were actually telling us, like this graph of the rise of the NASDAQ and then [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3151.04s)]
*  the crash of it afterwards, people were saying, you can't make companies anymore. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3155.12s)]
*  No one wants those anymore. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3160.04s)]
*  And we were saying, are you kidding me? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3161.3199999999997s)]
*  In fact, when we looked at this, if you looked at the internet usage, minutes spent, dollars [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3163.44s)]
*  spent, all that, the line was going straight up into the right. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3169.2s)]
*  The only thing that took a dip was valuations. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3172.64s)]
*  So the internet was real. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3175.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3177.0s)]
*  This was not a fad that was going away. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3177.56s)]
*  Yes, the valuations had gone skyrocketing relative to the relative usage. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3179.64s)]
*  But everything continued going up and to the right. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3183.56s)]
*  And it fully caught up with itself three or four years later. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3185.96s)]
*  But those three or four years were tough to persist when no one wanted to talk about it. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3189.72s)]
*  And I remember we had to fund a lot of our companies exclusively ourselves. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3194.32s)]
*  And that led to the lesson, which is we shouldn't do that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3199.6s)]
*  We should really get partners. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3201.92s)]
*  Even if we have enough money to fund them ourselves, we want to have people alongside of us. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3204.08s)]
*  But it was hard. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3208.56s)]
*  It was hard. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3209.72s)]
*  But that's where I learned this lesson, to take the naysayers and use them as rocket fuel. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3210.2s)]
*  I love that. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3213.8399999999997s)]
*  Yep. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3214.4399999999996s)]
*  The next lesson, I gave a whole TED Talk about this. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3216.16s)]
*  And by the way, if you're listening to this and you haven't seen Bill's TED Talk on timing, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3218.48s)]
*  I think it's about eight years ago. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3223.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3225.3199999999997s)]
*  2015, I think. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3226.08s)]
*  It's a fantastic TED Talk. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3227.24s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3229.68s)]
*  So this was a result of looking back at that time period at 20 years of companies and saying, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3230.04s)]
*  really, what happened? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3237.3199999999997s)]
*  Why did the one succeed succeed? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3238.2s)]
*  Why did the ones fail? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3239.84s)]
*  And there's many, many reasons. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3240.76s)]
*  Of course, they all eventually fail because they run out of money. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3241.92s)]
*  But why do they run out of money? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3244.4s)]
*  They run out of money because the world isn't quite ready for what you have yet. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3246.88s)]
*  And last off is maybe a perfect example. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3250.4s)]
*  Now that had dot com implications and others. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3252.76s)]
*  But the bandwidth wasn't there. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3254.6000000000004s)]
*  The cameras weren't there. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3257.76s)]
*  We were trying to invent so many things outside of our area that were core to our core mission, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3259.88s)]
*  literal mission in this case. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3264.7200000000003s)]
*  But think about some other companies. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3266.88s)]
*  Uber succeeded for many reasons. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3269.0s)]
*  But Uber succeeded because GPS had just become available widely in phones. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3271.96s)]
*  iPhone had just come out. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3276.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3276.88s)]
*  With a GPS in every unit. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3278.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3279.36s)]
*  If you tried to make Uber two years earlier, it would not have made it. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3279.92s)]
*  And Uber did not cause GPS to be available in everybody's pocket. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3283.72s)]
*  Someone else did. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3288.04s)]
*  Further, Uber succeeded really well because there was a big recession going on. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3289.76s)]
*  And they can recruit drivers very inexpensively because people needed extra money. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3293.68s)]
*  That timing was perfect. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3299.08s)]
*  Now, they didn't make that timing happen, but they got lucky. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3300.2799999999997s)]
*  But what you can do to make your luck better on timing is look at the world and look at [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3303.92s)]
*  where people are and look what technologies are adopted. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3309.72s)]
*  We had a company, one of our biggest lessons, we had a company called Z.com, which we started [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3312.2799999999997s)]
*  in 2000. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3317.24s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3317.7599999999998s)]
*  I was here then. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3318.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3319.96s)]
*  So here's what we're doing. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3320.72s)]
*  We were looking at the success of the e-commerce companies we had in the 90s and saying, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3321.72s)]
*  what's going to come online next? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3326.12s)]
*  Entertainment. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3327.8399999999997s)]
*  And we had the relationship with Steven Spielberg. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3329.0s)]
*  So we wanted to start a company to bring entertainment online. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3331.4s)]
*  Because of Steven Spielberg, we got introductions to Chris Rock and Adam Sandler. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3334.2s)]
*  I met with them personally, gave them 10% equity in the company and a million dollars for exclusive [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3337.8399999999997s)]
*  content from them. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3342.4s)]
*  We hired a great team from Disney. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3343.8399999999997s)]
*  We had Mike Lang and Joe Danunzio leading the effort. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3346.12s)]
*  We hired 70 people in the studio over in Burbank. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3350.04s)]
*  We started putting together this great content. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3352.6s)]
*  But there was no broadband penetration. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3354.32s)]
*  You couldn't even watch a video in your browser without downloading codecs and doing all kinds [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3356.1200000000003s)]
*  of weird stuff. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3359.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, plugins. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3360.52s)]
*  So the company grew, grew, grew. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3362.44s)]
*  Great stuff, great stuff. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3364.32s)]
*  I went out of business in 2003. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3365.5600000000004s)]
*  A year later, Flash comes out. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3367.5600000000004s)]
*  And now you can at least watch a video in your browser. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3369.84s)]
*  And a year later, we cross 50% broadband penetration and YouTube comes out. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3372.0800000000004s)]
*  So we almost could have been YouTube if we had waited a little bit longer. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3376.6000000000004s)]
*  So one of the lessons I've learned, I'm curious about it in relation to this, is living long [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3380.68s)]
*  enough to live forever. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3384.96s)]
*  Yes, that's very crucial. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3385.96s)]
*  So for me, I had a... [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3387.72s)]
*  I missed a couple of these timing-wise. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3392.6s)]
*  The last one I missed was Planetary Resources, an asteroid mining company. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3395.44s)]
*  And we had an amazing team. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3400.2799999999997s)]
*  And we were, you know, Chris Lewicki, who was part of Blastoff, was our chief engineer [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3402.3999999999996s)]
*  and then CEO. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3407.68s)]
*  And SpaceX was launching. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3410.4s)]
*  We had just passed the laws to allow private ownership of asteroid material, which is a [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3413.12s)]
*  big deal to get those laws changed in the US and in Luxembourg. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3418.12s)]
*  And these asteroids are multi-billion dollar to trillion dollar assets. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3422.04s)]
*  But the timing, and I still think it's probably another five years out. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3428.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3434.8399999999997s)]
*  I'd love to take another shot at that. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3435.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, what we always encourage our CEOs to do, sometimes they listen, sometimes they [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3437.6s)]
*  don't. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3441.44s)]
*  Sometimes it might not be right to listen, is take the money you have, spend it slowly [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3442.44s)]
*  so you last long enough. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3446.84s)]
*  And z.com, if we had taken the $10 million we raised and spent it at $2 million a year [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3448.32s)]
*  instead of $3 million a year, we might have been there. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3452.6s)]
*  Well, the other lesson here is building interim revenue engines, building interim products, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3454.68s)]
*  right? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3459.92s)]
*  If as a company, you can start generating revenue and stretch your runaway. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3460.92s)]
*  Anything you could do to last longer. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3468.52s)]
*  So you're really at that point intercepting good luck. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3469.88s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3472.6800000000003s)]
*  When you look at SpaceX, for example, SpaceX is exactly the story of the right timing. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3474.2000000000003s)]
*  So Elon builds Falcon 1, failure, failure, failure, success on his fourth launch, which [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3481.36s)]
*  he had to borrow the money to make that happen. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3487.8s)]
*  But what had just occurred was the space shuttle program was shut down. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3490.8s)]
*  And because the space shuttle program had been shut down, they put out a RFP for crew [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3496.48s)]
*  commercial vehicles. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3503.2400000000002s)]
*  And he won that after his fourth launch was successful and got a billion dollar contract [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3504.6000000000004s)]
*  when he was in negative cash flow. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3509.92s)]
*  Finding any way to stay alive until your market is ready for you. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3513.5200000000004s)]
*  So by definition, if you're doing something bold and new, you're ahead of your time. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3516.44s)]
*  So you need to catch up. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3520.8799999999997s)]
*  You need to catch up to the right time. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3522.6s)]
*  And by staying alive long enough, it's hard to do. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3524.3999999999996s)]
*  It's really hard to do because you have to have the patience. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3526.9599999999996s)]
*  You have to have the perseverance. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3530.24s)]
*  You have to find these other revenue sources. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3531.24s)]
*  You have to beg, borrow and steal for money. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3533.68s)]
*  You have to beg, borrow and steal for customers just to stay alive long enough. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3535.24s)]
*  So timing was number one. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3538.3999999999996s)]
*  And again, the advice there is use your money wisely and start generating revenues as early [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3539.8799999999997s)]
*  as you can. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3545.3199999999997s)]
*  Number two, team and execution. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3546.3199999999997s)]
*  Definitely finding the team like we were talking about, who's passionate about it, who has [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3548.52s)]
*  the perseverance to fight through the tough times, who takes the arrows in the back and [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3555.96s)]
*  turns them into motivation because you're going to have a lot of nos to make success. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3559.7799999999997s)]
*  And again, the stories that you often hear sound up and to the right, but it never is [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3566.3599999999997s)]
*  that smooth along the way. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3570.08s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3571.64s)]
*  But the other thing that I most recommend about timing, I think now, is that you can't [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3572.64s)]
*  control timing. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3576.48s)]
*  So just be honest about it. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3577.88s)]
*  Be honest if the world is ready. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3579.7200000000003s)]
*  I'll give you one other example from ours. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3580.88s)]
*  Around 2001, I had an idea I was calling my life. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3584.32s)]
*  And my life was going to be a bracelet that you wear that tracks all your vitals, that [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3588.08s)]
*  tries to predict cancer or other disease by looking at every single we can and doing matching [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3592.2400000000002s)]
*  between post facto doctor visits and what signals we saw months earlier. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3597.0s)]
*  People came to me and said, I'm not going to wear something all the time. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3604.36s)]
*  I said, modern signals, are you crazy? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3606.8s)]
*  It's too privacy. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3607.8s)]
*  And now look, we all have something on our. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3608.8s)]
*  Everybody accepts that now. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3611.28s)]
*  We were just far too ahead of the mentality of people willing to do that. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3612.98s)]
*  Of course, 10 years later, Fitbit came out and then that gradually wore people down. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3616.7200000000003s)]
*  And now if you sold something, they could save people's lives. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3621.2400000000002s)]
*  All they had to do was wear something and say, of course, no problem. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3623.44s)]
*  So that company failed in around 2002. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3626.28s)]
*  We couldn't find any investors to participate and we didn't really go forward with it. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3630.92s)]
*  Being honest about the feedback you're getting on what people really accept what you're doing [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3635.5800000000004s)]
*  is very important. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3639.38s)]
*  Yeah, that is true. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3640.38s)]
*  Not deceiving yourself. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3641.5s)]
*  Yep. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3642.5s)]
*  Yep. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3643.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3644.5s)]
*  So these are just a bunch of different companies where the timing was good. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3645.5s)]
*  Timing wasn't as good. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3646.5s)]
*  This was, I was actually talking about again, how PV panels are now so cheap. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3648.34s)]
*  Four times cheaper for a PV panel than a window. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3653.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3655.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3656.46s)]
*  So you could buy a window with a frame that does nothing except let light in and that [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3657.46s)]
*  costs $417 and you can buy a PV panel the same size that costs $109. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3660.46s)]
*  And it makes electricity. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3664.5s)]
*  So that, well, this is another lesson from you, from exponential. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3665.82s)]
*  When you have a learning curve to drive down the cost, you get exponential cost reductions [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3670.9s)]
*  over time as you make things in exponentially large volume. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3675.18s)]
*  It almost follows Moore's law kind of effect. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3678.68s)]
*  So there are very few, we don't make windows at the scale. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3681.22s)]
*  We make PV panels. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3684.14s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3685.14s)]
*  Of the same size, of the same format. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3686.14s)]
*  So it really is incredible. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3688.42s)]
*  I was talking about how AI feels like the internet in 1995, but faster, even faster. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3691.02s)]
*  I thought about this, Bill Gross must be having a heyday on Idea Generation. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3696.58s)]
*  I would have a heyday on it, except I weren't so focused on climate. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3702.58s)]
*  So I still have AI ideas and I do them, but not one a week like I could be. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3706.58s)]
*  Okay, lesson number four, iterate like crazy. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3712.3s)]
*  I definitely feel, we talked about it earlier. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3715.82s)]
*  It's not your initial idea. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3718.8s)]
*  It's how you respond to the market. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3720.48s)]
*  And you really need to be listening to customers, listening to feedback, adjusting things along [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3723.32s)]
*  the way. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3727.44s)]
*  And I actually think you win on iteration, how fast you can learn per time. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3728.44s)]
*  Agility. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3732.04s)]
*  Yeah, it really matters. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3733.04s)]
*  And running experiments and actually aggressively running experiments. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3734.04s)]
*  I remember one of my favorite quotes from Jeff Bezos is, our success at Amazon is a [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3738.36s)]
*  function of the number of experiments we run per year, per month, per week and per day. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3743.52s)]
*  Totally. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3747.4s)]
*  So I joke, I should have called it iterate lab, not ideal lab, because iteration is more [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3748.96s)]
*  important than the idea. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3752.64s)]
*  But ideal lab sounds better, but iterate is what you really have to do. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3753.64s)]
*  And back to the Jeff Bezos quote, I call it learning per time turns on knowledge. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3757.32s)]
*  Every time, if you're a startup, you're competing against a big company probably, some incumbent [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3763.2000000000003s)]
*  somewhere, whether it's Google, whether it's Pricewaterhouse, whatever, whoever you're competing [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3769.6s)]
*  with, they're better funded. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3775.48s)]
*  They have more people, they have more brand. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3776.8799999999997s)]
*  What do you have? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3778.7999999999997s)]
*  You have agility. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3779.7999999999997s)]
*  That's the one thing you can- [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3780.7999999999997s)]
*  You have willingness to fail. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3781.7999999999997s)]
*  Both those. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3782.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3783.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, one of the biggest challenges I see is the large corporations. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3784.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they can't take a chance. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3787.56s)]
*  This is also true of the wealthiest individuals, are afraid of doing anything that makes them [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3789.64s)]
*  look foolish and failing. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3795.08s)]
*  And it's like, I celebrate those entrepreneurs like yourself, like Elon Musk, that are willing [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3797.68s)]
*  to like just bet it all over and over and over again. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3803.24s)]
*  And individuals who are hoarding their cash, it's like, you know, you still can't take [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3807.12s)]
*  it with you. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3811.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, do something, change the world for God's sakes. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3812.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3815.04s)]
*  Well, on the willingness to fail, I wanted ideal lab to be a safe place for people to [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3816.04s)]
*  do experiments like that. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3820.2799999999997s)]
*  And no matter how much you say, we want people to do that. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3822.16s)]
*  People watch what really happens. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3826.3199999999997s)]
*  And if they see anybody ever lose their job by taking a chance, then they won't do it. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3827.3199999999997s)]
*  So one of the structures of ideal lab that we put in place to mitigate that was if a [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3832.2s)]
*  company fails or if a person makes an idea in a company that fails, one, we celebrate [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3836.9199999999996s)]
*  the learning. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3841.56s)]
*  But two, if that company actually goes out of business, we try and take the best people [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3842.56s)]
*  and just put them in a new company. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3845.7599999999998s)]
*  So we really want to make it safe. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3848.18s)]
*  We really want to make it safe for people to take chances. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3850.18s)]
*  And the only way they'll really feel that safety is if they see that they are safe. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3852.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3856.0s)]
*  Not the words you use, but the actuality of what happens. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3857.0s)]
*  And this sounds very much like Astro Teller at Google X, right? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3859.28s)]
*  I asked Astro one day, why are you so secretive at X? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3863.36s)]
*  And his answer surprised me. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3869.68s)]
*  He said, I want you to imagine the rate at which our companies fail here. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3871.6s)]
*  And if the San Jose Mercury News, whatever it's called, was announcing Google fails, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3876.4s)]
*  another company, another company. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3880.6s)]
*  But you said another important advantage that a startup has over a big company. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3882.88s)]
*  A big company has a reputation to protect and they can't announce those failures. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3887.56s)]
*  And they can't announce them, they might leak out, so they just don't take them. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3892.4s)]
*  They don't take the chances. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3895.2000000000003s)]
*  And maybe even the Google versus OpenAI example of recent is one example of Google sort of [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3896.76s)]
*  inventing that technology. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3902.48s)]
*  And for years before. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3904.2400000000002s)]
*  For years before. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3905.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3906.2400000000002s)]
*  But it's a little too risky for them to release something that could damage Google's reputation. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3907.2400000000002s)]
*  But for another startup who has nothing to lose. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3910.1s)]
*  Well, the other example here is YouTube and Google videos. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3912.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3915.64s)]
*  Google videos preceded YouTube by some time. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3916.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, is that true? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3919.04s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3920.04s)]
*  And YouTube started going up and to the right because Google's lawyers were like, you can't [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3921.04s)]
*  put that on, you can't put that on. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3925.8799999999997s)]
*  And so when Chad Hurley was allowing anybody to put any videos on there, their user adoption [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3927.3599999999997s)]
*  was so high, Larry and Sergey had no other option but to buy them. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3932.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3936.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a perfect example. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3937.2799999999997s)]
*  But that's why a startup has to take advantage of that. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3938.52s)]
*  If you have that advantage, you got to use it because that's almost the only advantage [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3942.04s)]
*  you have compared to all the other great advantages that the big company has. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3944.64s)]
*  That's so true. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3947.7999999999997s)]
*  Yep. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3948.7999999999997s)]
*  So next one, create a remarkable offering. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3949.7999999999997s)]
*  So this is a little bit related to being bold. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3951.24s)]
*  But this great quote from Robert Stevens, who did Geek Squad at Best Buy. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3954.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3962.4s)]
*  It says, marketing is a tax on being unremarkable. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3963.4s)]
*  And I love it because it really says, if you have to spend money to convince people about [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3967.08s)]
*  your product, that's the marketing dollars you have to spend. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3972.04s)]
*  But if you just make your offering incredible in the first place, that is your marketing. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3974.92s)]
*  And I love this because I'm always trying to, whenever I'm pitching an idea, I want [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3979.52s)]
*  the idea to stand out and sound incredible. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3984.28s)]
*  But coming up with the right way to make your offer stand out is really, really important. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3987.54s)]
*  And it could be anything. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3991.44s)]
*  I don't know if you remember. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3992.44s)]
*  When Google first launched Gmail, I think they launched it on April Fool's Day in a [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3993.48s)]
*  given year when they offered you a gigabyte of free email. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=3998.52s)]
*  And that sounded like such a crazy offer. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4002.52s)]
*  They made it sound like it was April Fool's Day. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4004.96s)]
*  But it was real. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4008.48s)]
*  And they made an offer and it sounded so exciting that people were rushing to go try it out. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4009.98s)]
*  And I think you need to try and do that with everything. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4014.56s)]
*  Now, of course, giving away a gigabyte of email now costs nothing because storage is [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4016.68s)]
*  so cheap. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4020.1s)]
*  And now they have advertising to cover it. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4021.44s)]
*  But now it's a business too. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4024.16s)]
*  You can buy the business version of Gmail. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4025.48s)]
*  But coming up with a way that your offering sounds irresistible to people is very important. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4028.16s)]
*  Again, especially if you're a startup, you have limited funds, you have limited budget, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4032.56s)]
*  you have limited way to stand out. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4035.8799999999997s)]
*  Making your offering – Signal above the noise. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4037.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you have any good examples from your recent companies that you love? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4039.12s)]
*  I like going out and offering. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4042.96s)]
*  We came up with an idea of offering whatever your cost is for energy, we'll do a deal [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4046.2599999999998s)]
*  with you that's just 10% less. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4051.98s)]
*  Just show us your bill and we'll charge you 10% less. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4053.72s)]
*  So that way it's a no risk, you're going to save money in the first month. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4055.66s)]
*  That would be an example of remarkable offering. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4058.74s)]
*  Just coming up with anything that makes it so obvious for people to just say, wow, that's [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4060.66s)]
*  too hard to pass up. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4065.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes, irresistible offer. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4067.2599999999998s)]
*  Next is being success sensitive. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4070.98s)]
*  So we talked about this. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4073.24s)]
*  You asked about how much equity we give out early on. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4074.24s)]
*  And I learned that it's so hard to make a company work and you so badly want every one [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4077.3799999999997s)]
*  of them to work that forget about dilution, just do whatever it takes to make the thing [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4083.38s)]
*  successful. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4088.34s)]
*  The ratio of something to nothing is infinite. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4089.34s)]
*  Give out the equity liberally, make sure everybody wins, make sure investors get a good deal, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4092.06s)]
*  make sure employees have a good deal, make sure everyone is aligned. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4096.68s)]
*  When you have alignment, you have more success and to be so worried about each point of equity, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4100.52s)]
*  which is hard to give up as an entrepreneur. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4106.22s)]
*  But I learned – I could not agree more. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4109.02s)]
*  The times that I have failed on a couple of occasions when I drove the valuation up too [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4111.4s)]
*  fast and then you inevitably stubble because you're doing something big and bold, it's [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4118.08s)]
*  hard and then you're doing it down and around. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4124.24s)]
*  It's very intoxicating to drive the valuation up, but it's also dangerous. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4127.4s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4130.759999999999s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4131.759999999999s)]
*  And I learned that lesson and I really try and convince CEOs that sometimes CEOs get [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4132.759999999999s)]
*  this offer, someone wants to offer them a little bit more money or a little bit lower [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4137.6s)]
*  valuation and they're grinding themselves about whether they should take it and I say, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4140.4400000000005s)]
*  just take it. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4144.76s)]
*  Just if that person is going to help you be successful, just do it. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4145.76s)]
*  When's the best time to raise money? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4149.160000000001s)]
*  Right now. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4151.240000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4152.240000000001s)]
*  So getting great alignment between everybody is really, really important. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4153.240000000001s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4155.64s)]
*  That is maturity, by the way. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4156.64s)]
*  That comes with maturity and experience and it's wisdom. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4159.88s)]
*  Yeah, definitely learned that one the hard way, but very valuable. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4162.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4166.160000000001s)]
*  Building a complementary team. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4167.24s)]
*  Definitely, I learned, it took me until I was 35 years old to learn this one. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4169.0s)]
*  I wish I had learned this one when I was in college. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4173.36s)]
*  I was hiring people like me. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4175.96s)]
*  I was looking for people like you, like my brother, like other people to surround myself [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4178.12s)]
*  with people with the same view as me. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4181.5199999999995s)]
*  But to be successful in a company, you need a whole range of people. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4182.92s)]
*  And this chart is a good example of it. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4186.0s)]
*  If this chart is time on the X axis and success on the Y axis, the entrepreneur, the E type [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4187.88s)]
*  person starts the company. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4195.36s)]
*  That's the only person who can start a company. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4197.28s)]
*  It's the person who's a dreamer, person who's got the idea. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4198.5599999999995s)]
*  So the company goes up and to the right for a little while. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4201.639999999999s)]
*  But if the entrepreneur can't get anything done, can't finish, can't ship a product, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4204.2s)]
*  can't get, then the company will eventually fail. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4208.08s)]
*  Now just because you're an entrepreneur doesn't mean you can't finish something. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4210.36s)]
*  Like you and I both know how to, we know how to graduate college, we know how to get our [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4212.759999999999s)]
*  papers done, we know how to build something. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4216.16s)]
*  But you eventually have to bring the P or producer skill into the company next. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4219.74s)]
*  And the P skill is the ability to finish the product, ship the product, get it in customers [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4224.28s)]
*  hands, get a customer to buy it, raise the money, pay the bills. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4228.28s)]
*  So the P skill is necessary in a company too. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4232.599999999999s)]
*  But even that will only carry you so far. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4234.36s)]
*  Eventually, if you only have E and P skill in the company, you'll fail as well. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4236.44s)]
*  Now you need some A skill. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4240.92s)]
*  So what's the A skill? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4242.08s)]
*  That's the skill that I have none of. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4243.679999999999s)]
*  Not only do I have none of it, I have a negative. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4244.679999999999s)]
*  You're chief of staff, yes. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4245.679999999999s)]
*  A is chief of staff, A is the administration, A is the operations. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4247.44s)]
*  All the operations. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4252.12s)]
*  It's opening the bank account. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4253.12s)]
*  It's paying the bills on time. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4255.08s)]
*  It's making the payroll. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4256.08s)]
*  It's getting people's health care plans set up. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4257.08s)]
*  It's all the stuff we have no patients for. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4258.08s)]
*  Well, so that you and I have no patients for. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4260.08s)]
*  But there's some people who, that's what's incredible. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4261.599999999999s)]
*  There's people who not only have patients for it, they love that. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4264.48s)]
*  But I didn't understand that. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4268.08s)]
*  I so thought that everybody hates that. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4269.5599999999995s)]
*  I could understand there were people who actually love that. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4272.24s)]
*  And I wanted to find someone like that to compliment me. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4274.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4277.24s)]
*  And I finally learned that. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4278.24s)]
*  But then even further than the A, and you need the A. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4279.24s)]
*  So the A is the person who sort of makes the trains run on time, makes everything work [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4281.24s)]
*  together. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4284.599999999999s)]
*  But even beyond that, you'll still fail because all those three personality types, they sort [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4285.599999999999s)]
*  of hate each other's guts. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4291.16s)]
*  The A doesn't like the P. The P is demanding and is a bull in a china shop. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4292.44s)]
*  The P wants to make sales and feels like the A is holding the back. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4295.679999999999s)]
*  The E wants to invent new things and feels like the P and the A are holding the back. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4298.72s)]
*  So you need I. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4301.96s)]
*  The I is the integrator or the skill that can bring those people together and solve [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4303.96s)]
*  conflict. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4307.679999999999s)]
*  Now, again, it doesn't have to be a separate person. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4308.679999999999s)]
*  It usually is. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4310.5s)]
*  Well, they soon be an AI that's doing a number they see for you. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4311.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4314.7s)]
*  So you need to find these other skills. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4315.7s)]
*  For me, I didn't even know those existed, let alone could I get along with them. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4317.94s)]
*  But once I learned that there were wonderful I's that could help me match with P's and [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4322.32s)]
*  A's, it was fantastic. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4327.7s)]
*  And it's still hard. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4330.3s)]
*  Like even me describing this makes it sound like I'm good at this. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4331.3s)]
*  It's still hard. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4335.2s)]
*  The people part of the equation is still the hardest part and the most important. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4336.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4341.28s)]
*  But if you can get all those skills in harmony, you have an unstoppable company. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4342.28s)]
*  When you have all these in harmony, you have an advantage culturally over another company [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4346.08s)]
*  that doesn't. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4350.9s)]
*  This is where culture can beat another company. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4351.9s)]
*  So you can win a company with IP, better business model, better capitalization, better marketing [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4354.5599999999995s)]
*  and all that. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4358.34s)]
*  But you can also win with better culture. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4359.34s)]
*  Because if you have all these people in harmony, you really are unstoppable. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4360.34s)]
*  You can do things that other people can't touch. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4364.76s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4367.04s)]
*  So that's the complementary team. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4368.04s)]
*  Be a personal growth learning machine. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4371.12s)]
*  We talked about this a little bit earlier, but this is about getting feedback, improving [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4372.320000000001s)]
*  yourself, learning new things, learning new skills like me, learning that there's an A, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4377.400000000001s)]
*  learning that there's an I type person. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4382.84s)]
*  But I heard this one statement once, closing the gap. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4384.96s)]
*  I see people who I admire and I say, how could I be like that? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4391.7s)]
*  They're exhibiting some skills that I don't know how to do that. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4395.0199999999995s)]
*  Rather than thinking about the big leap between me and them, I think about, let me just close [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4398.94s)]
*  the gap a little bit. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4402.72s)]
*  Let me just try and close the gap between me and that skill a little bit each week or [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4403.72s)]
*  each month. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4407.5599999999995s)]
*  Let me just get a little closer. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4408.5599999999995s)]
*  It was a way of me thinking about it being not so big of a chasm that I had across to [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4410.54s)]
*  get there. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4413.98s)]
*  Got it. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4414.98s)]
*  And what little skills could I pick up that will make me a little bit better at the things [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4415.98s)]
*  that I'm lacking right now? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4419.679999999999s)]
*  There is a school of thought that says, if you're excellent in skills A, B, and C, and [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4421.16s)]
*  don't have D, E, and F, double down on A, B, and C. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4427.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4430.68s)]
*  And I agree with that. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4431.68s)]
*  But if there are skills, D, E, and F, that are pulling you down, that are negating you, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4434.320000000001s)]
*  that are hurting your other skills, you could find a way to minimize that. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4440.280000000001s)]
*  And that's an example of closing the gap for me. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4444.64s)]
*  And do you do this with a mentor? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4446.68s)]
*  Mentor? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4448.96s)]
*  Do you do this by reading? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4449.96s)]
*  How do you do this? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4450.96s)]
*  Mentor, coach, reading, and feedback. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4451.96s)]
*  And understanding, well, asking for feedback, learning how to take feedback and accept it, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4455.12s)]
*  learning how it's not personal but beneficial, having people you trust to give you feedback [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4460.12s)]
*  that's valuable. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4464.12s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4465.12s)]
*  One of my favorite sayings, I was in conversation at a Goldman Sachs event with Eli and he said, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4466.12s)]
*  my friends tell me what's great, my best friends tell me what sucks. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4470.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4474.36s)]
*  So you really need some best friends. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4475.36s)]
*  To tell you what sucks and to just make some impact on closing the gap, not eliminating [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4478.04s)]
*  it completely. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4483.16s)]
*  It's too hard. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4484.16s)]
*  You're not going to change yourself and you don't want to eliminate the strengths. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4485.16s)]
*  But finding a way to make it as an incremental improvement to be a little bit better. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4489.24s)]
*  Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4492.88s)]
*  If you did, did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Labs, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4494.98s)]
*  that they spent billions on bio-defense weapons, the ability to accurately detect viruses and [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4501.84s)]
*  microbes by reading their RNA. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4507.88s)]
*  Well, a company called Viome exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos Labs to build [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4510.12s)]
*  a platform that can measure your microbiome and the RNA in your blood. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4516.28s)]
*  Now, Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called Full Body Intelligence, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4521.28s)]
*  which collects a few drops of your blood, spit, and stool, and can tell you so much [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4525.96s)]
*  about your health. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4530.0s)]
*  They've tested over 700,000 individuals and used their AI models to deliver members' [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4531.16s)]
*  critical health guidance, like what foods you should eat, what foods you shouldn't [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4535.96s)]
*  eat, as well as your supplements and probiotics, your biological age, and other deep health [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4540.12s)]
*  insights. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4545.639999999999s)]
*  And the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4546.92s)]
*  As reported in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, after just six months of following [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4550.32s)]
*  Viome's recommendations, members reported the following. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4555.28s)]
*  Listen, I've been using Viome for three years. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4558.32s)]
*  I know that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4571.4s)]
*  Best of all, Viome is affordable, which is part of my mission to democratize health. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4576.719999999999s)]
*  If you want to join me on this journey, go to Viome.com slash Peter. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4581.76s)]
*  I've asked Naveen Jain, a friend of mine who's the founder and CEO of Viome, to give my listeners [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4585.64s)]
*  a special discount. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4590.18s)]
*  You'll find it at Viome.com slash Peter. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4591.64s)]
*  Number nine assess your commitment. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4595.56s)]
*  We talked about this earlier. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4596.92s)]
*  This is, do you wake up, and I told you about recruiting CEOs, do you wake up and say, I [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4598.320000000001s)]
*  can't sleep over this idea, it's too important to me. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4603.8s)]
*  So I taught a class in entrepreneurship at Caltech this last term. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4605.96s)]
*  It's the first time I've ever done that. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4608.56s)]
*  How big was the class? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4609.68s)]
*  It was 31 students. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4610.68s)]
*  I would have loved to visit your class. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4612.6s)]
*  We filmed it. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4613.6s)]
*  I'm going to try and get it online. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4614.6s)]
*  But it was really, really way harder than I thought, but way more rewarding than I thought. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4615.88s)]
*  It was really fun. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4619.4800000000005s)]
*  And I taught them about these kinds of things. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4620.6s)]
*  I helped them create business plans, take their ideas forward, and then we're having [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4622.400000000001s)]
*  a business plan competition that we funded so that they can get some awards to try and [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4625.200000000001s)]
*  take their ideas forward. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4629.04s)]
*  And when I was having them come up with 10 ideas, they're saying 10 ideas? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4631.64s)]
*  I'm not as good at ideas as you are, Bill. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4636.52s)]
*  I said, just come up with 10 ideas. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4638.96s)]
*  They don't even have to be ideas. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4640.96s)]
*  Just even come up with 10 problem statements, meaning things in the world that you wish [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4642.96s)]
*  were better. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4646.76s)]
*  Like, I hate traffic on the 405 when I wish there was a way I could – anything. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4647.76s)]
*  Just come up with something that you don't like that you wish were different. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4651.88s)]
*  That's an idea as far as I'm concerned. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4655.08s)]
*  So everybody in the class came up with 10 ideas. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4657.0s)]
*  Then I said, now – that was homework assignment number one. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4659.36s)]
*  Next homework assignment, you're going to pair them down. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4663.2s)]
*  So how are you going to pair them down? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4665.44s)]
*  I'm going to give you a spreadsheet with 16 columns in it. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4666.44s)]
*  You're going to pick any 10 of those columns and give a score. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4670.08s)]
*  So one column is what's the size of the market? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4673.2s)]
*  One column is are you capable of doing this? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4675.12s)]
*  How hard would it be to recruit people to do it? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4677.44s)]
*  How good would the margins be in this business? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4679.72s)]
*  And on and on and on. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4681.36s)]
*  And you pick any of the columns you want, but I just want you to fill up a spreadsheet, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4682.76s)]
*  a 10 by 10 matrix, just so you can figure out which of these you're going to take [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4685.92s)]
*  forward for your business plan in this class. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4689.64s)]
*  And one of the columns is how committed to you are this idea? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4692.32s)]
*  Would you spend a week on it, a month, a year? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4695.2s)]
*  How long would you spend on it? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4697.18s)]
*  So two people in the class came back on that column and said, I would spend the rest of [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4698.66s)]
*  my life on this. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4703.0199999999995s)]
*  I said, you spend the rest of your life on this. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4704.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I care about this so deeply. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4706.34s)]
*  Well, that's your idea. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4708.0199999999995s)]
*  Forget the other nine columns. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4709.38s)]
*  You don't have to worry about anything else. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4710.38s)]
*  That's the criteria. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4712.0199999999995s)]
*  So if you could assess your commitment to something and decide, I care about this so [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4713.4s)]
*  much that I'll go to the end of the earth for it, that's the way you should decide. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4718.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I could not agree more. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4722.38s)]
*  In the parlance of what I write and teach, I call that your massive transformative purpose. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4724.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4732.28s)]
*  And this is just my way of saying that same thing. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4733.28s)]
*  But using a how long would I be willing to commit to this as a filter for your life, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4735.88s)]
*  for your ideas is a really great one. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4740.14s)]
*  And so I think a lot of entrepreneurs don't realize it takes a decade. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4741.76s)]
*  It takes at least a decade. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4747.08s)]
*  Point at any company. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4749.4400000000005s)]
*  People don't realize SpaceX is, you know, God, 20 plus years old right now. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4752.84s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4758.04s)]
*  It does take a long time. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4759.04s)]
*  It stinks, but it does take that long. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4761.04s)]
*  You don't know about it during its formative ages, its formative years. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4763.24s)]
*  Yeah, so you really have to be committed. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4766.4400000000005s)]
*  So I'm committed to this climate work that I'm doing right now. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4768.64s)]
*  It also happens to be the biggest business opportunity. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4773.04s)]
*  Well, it has a few things. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4775.12s)]
*  It's biggest business opportunity. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4776.76s)]
*  It matches my skill. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4778.18s)]
*  I'm a mechanical engineer and I love doing things like that. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4779.18s)]
*  So I'm choosing mechanical related things in the climate, but also I'll work on it [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4781.32s)]
*  for the rest of my life. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4785.04s)]
*  So it's exactly me as that criteria. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4786.04s)]
*  I didn't think about it that way, but it was really resonate with me when these two young [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4787.639999999999s)]
*  women said that about their ideas in this class about being important criteria. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4790.84s)]
*  And then finally, be persistent. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4795.599999999999s)]
*  So this graph is so great. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4796.94s)]
*  Every idea you start out with, like with blast off that we talked about earlier, but every [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4802.2s)]
*  idea I started out with, it's always this is the best idea ever. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4805.12s)]
*  You wouldn't start it if you didn't feel that. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4810.0s)]
*  But then after you get into it, you start learning there are challenges. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4811.4400000000005s)]
*  There are roadblocks. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4814.64s)]
*  There are things. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4815.64s)]
*  It's harder than I thought. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4816.64s)]
*  Reality sets in. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4817.64s)]
*  Reality sets in. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4818.64s)]
*  And my biggest learning over the last 25 years, over the last 50 years is that that just happens. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4819.64s)]
*  Like that is a fact of life. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4825.52s)]
*  That's part of the story. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4826.900000000001s)]
*  That's part of the journey. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4827.900000000001s)]
*  And in fact, climbing out that dark swamp of despair, that is the thing. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4828.900000000001s)]
*  Like that is the skill that makes the difference between succeeding and not. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4833.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's the persistence. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4837.320000000001s)]
*  For me, I remember with XPRIZE, I came up with the idea in 94, launched it in 96. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4839.0s)]
*  And then you've got the Columbia accident. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4845.4s)]
*  You've got a meltdown in 2001. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4848.679999999999s)]
*  And people literally call me saying, give up. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4853.5599999999995s)]
*  It's never going to happen. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4858.24s)]
*  You're never going to get it funded. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4859.24s)]
*  My other, my Zero G Corporation, have you flown with us? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4861.639999999999s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4864.92s)]
*  I have to come and fly. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4866.52s)]
*  But I remember. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4868.36s)]
*  Howard has done it multiple times. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4869.36s)]
*  Yeah, he's enjoyed it. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4870.36s)]
*  I remember coming up with the business model and being so naive. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4873.56s)]
*  Yeah, so naive about what it costs to operate 727s and do this and get through the FAA on [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4878.32s)]
*  this. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4883.64s)]
*  And of course, my favorite example was going into the FAA so confident with all my engineering [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4884.64s)]
*  done that we were going to be able to fly because NASA has been flying people in weightless [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4892.64s)]
*  parabolic flights. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4898.04s)]
*  And the associate administrators who I had in the room look at me and go, you can't do [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4899.04s)]
*  this. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4902.76s)]
*  It doesn't allow this. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4905.76s)]
*  You're not allowed to take people out of their seat belts. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4907.200000000001s)]
*  Okay, but Peter, you have the naysayer gene built into you. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4909.240000000001s)]
*  When people tell you that, it makes you want to do it even more. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4913.280000000001s)]
*  I told them, I said, listen, you're either going to retire or die before I give up. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4916.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4920.72s)]
*  So entrepreneurs who have been successful have automatically made it through this. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4922.2s)]
*  But if you want to bring new entrepreneurs in and they're young or they haven't experienced [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4928.4800000000005s)]
*  this yet, to teach them that this is going to happen is eye-opening because they so often [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4933.0s)]
*  hear stories of up and to the right where there is no swamp of despair in the middle. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4938.92s)]
*  So making people understand that that's part of it. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4943.400000000001s)]
*  And in fact, I think this is not true only of entrepreneurship. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4945.88s)]
*  Here on the top, it says, emotional journey of creating anything great. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4950.2s)]
*  This is the emotional journey of graduating from college, of writing a book, of doing [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4954.36s)]
*  a play, of anything that you want to do that is an important thing. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4957.64s)]
*  And in fact, you don't appreciate it unless you go through something like that. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4961.76s)]
*  It's given to you. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4965.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4967.28s)]
*  So I really end on this. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4968.28s)]
*  And the only thing I add to that is this try again, which was a great lesson I learned [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4970.5199999999995s)]
*  from Reid Hoffman. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4974.72s)]
*  So I'm at a Lean Startup Conference and Reid Hoffman is presenting. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4975.72s)]
*  And he talks about how LinkedIn was his third social network. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4979.28s)]
*  He had two failed social networks before that. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4985.16s)]
*  I didn't know that either. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4987.48s)]
*  And each one, he learned something that made him want to try again. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4989.12s)]
*  And he was willing to try again because he felt, oh, now I know how to do this a little [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4993.2s)]
*  bit better. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4996.8s)]
*  So if you fail at something and you don't learn anything new and you don't know a new [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=4997.9s)]
*  way to do it, I don't recommend trying again. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5000.719999999999s)]
*  But if you failed at something and you learn something and you say, ah, so for example, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5003.12s)]
*  the Z.com, which we learned our mistake of being too early. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5008.04s)]
*  If I had known that back in 2004, 2005, I could have tried again. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5010.96s)]
*  It's not appropriate to try again now. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5015.6s)]
*  It's too late. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5016.88s)]
*  But this lesson I took away to think of each of these things as at bats, where you go up [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5018.28s)]
*  at if a baseball player goes up at bat and they strike out, they don't give up. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5025.92s)]
*  They don't never play baseball again. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5029.24s)]
*  They look at the tape. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5030.8s)]
*  They ask their coach about what was that last pitch? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5031.98s)]
*  What did I miss about the signal? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5035.24s)]
*  What did I do? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5036.24s)]
*  And you go up at bat again. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5038.04s)]
*  You go try again. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5039.04s)]
*  And the idea of taking a company even that it failed and doing that same idea again, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5040.04s)]
*  but with new knowledge, didn't really resonate with me until I heard Reid Hoffman say it. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5046.44s)]
*  And now I really even feel that. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5050.44s)]
*  I've done that twice before, one with International Space University, then Singularity University [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5052.24s)]
*  and learning from the first business model failure and creating it again. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5059.32s)]
*  And then with human longevity and fountain life. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5063.12s)]
*  How about yourself? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5065.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5067.04s)]
*  So I did different solar companies that I learned from, different storage companies [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5068.04s)]
*  I learned from. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5072.84s)]
*  And again, sometimes you miss the timing and now it's too late to try it again. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5074.280000000001s)]
*  But sometimes you learn something and now the timing is right. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5079.6s)]
*  So one example, I did an energy storage company in 2013 that didn't work out. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5082.64s)]
*  But that's because solar energy wasn't cheaper than fossil fuel at that time. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5087.160000000001s)]
*  So I knew what was going to happen. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5090.4800000000005s)]
*  But now 10 years later, 2013, 2023, now all of a sudden PV prices came down, not by my [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5093.42s)]
*  doing, by China's doing, by Germany investing in subsidies and other things happen in the [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5099.3s)]
*  world that I couldn't make happen. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5103.9s)]
*  I was hoping they would happen. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5105.22s)]
*  They took 10 years. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5106.22s)]
*  Like you said, everything takes 10 years. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5107.22s)]
*  It took 10 years for PV prices to come down to be competitive with fossil fuels. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5108.78s)]
*  But that happened as an externality that now makes going back and focusing on storage [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5112.38s)]
*  valuable. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5116.74s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5117.74s)]
*  Bill, to close us out here, I typically say entrepreneurship is the greatest joy. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5119.0599999999995s)]
*  I love it. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5130.78s)]
*  I love the art of starting a company. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5131.86s)]
*  I'm on 27th now, not under 50, but... [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5134.46s)]
*  That's incredible, 27th by the way. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5138.98s)]
*  Anyway, it's joyful. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5140.98s)]
*  What are your thoughts to the entrepreneur who's on the verge of taking that risk? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5146.38s)]
*  Well, I would say it's one of the most rewarding things of all time. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5153.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a great thing for personal growth. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5156.820000000001s)]
*  It's a great thing for bonding with other people. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5158.92s)]
*  My children were in the school play in high school. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5161.780000000001s)]
*  I never was. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5164.700000000001s)]
*  And I saw the bonding and camaraderie that they had working on something together and [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5165.96s)]
*  the celebration they had when the play was done. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5169.820000000001s)]
*  And I thought, God, I really missed out on that life. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5172.860000000001s)]
*  And I realized, no, I didn't. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5174.46s)]
*  I did it with entrepreneurship. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5175.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5176.58s)]
*  I make my own way of having celebration with a team. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5177.58s)]
*  So it's a wonderful way to bond with other people, change the world, make the world a [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5181.38s)]
*  better place. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5186.22s)]
*  And I would say over the course of my career, it's gotten easier in the sense that people [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5187.66s)]
*  understand entrepreneurship. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5193.0199999999995s)]
*  There's way more investors available to do this now. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5194.78s)]
*  There's way more openness. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5197.42s)]
*  Entrepreneurship is celebrated in a way that it wasn't. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5198.94s)]
*  When I graduated from college, I was hiring some people after I graduated from Caltech. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5200.86s)]
*  I had to take their parents to dinner to convince them I wasn't some pariah because they had [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5204.94s)]
*  offers at JPL and aerospace companies. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5208.82s)]
*  And here I was getting them to come to a little startup. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5211.259999999999s)]
*  Like, what are you doing to my child? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5213.139999999999s)]
*  But now that doesn't happen anymore. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5216.219999999999s)]
*  I think we're around the same age for when we were in high school into college, it was [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5217.98s)]
*  Wall Street, which was the place to be. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5223.86s)]
*  You would graduate, you go get a safe job and a big business. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5227.46s)]
*  The idea now, the other thing that's really great for entrepreneurship, especially in [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5230.82s)]
*  the United States and especially in California, but everywhere in the United States, is people [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5235.3s)]
*  who have a failure, that can almost be a badge of honor. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5240.58s)]
*  And you learn. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5243.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5244.82s)]
*  So I think there are some cultures that treat it a little bit more like a scarlet letter [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5245.82s)]
*  as opposed to a badge of honor. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5249.5s)]
*  But here, if you've learned something from your entrepreneurship, you can go do anything [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5251.66s)]
*  still even if it doesn't work out. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5256.54s)]
*  So the combination of the impact it can have, the camaraderie, the joy, the learning, and [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5258.3s)]
*  then the upside, of course, the upside is pretty incredible too. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5264.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, having an ownership stake in a company, I said it before, but I'll say it again. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5267.14s)]
*  It unlocks human potential. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5272.900000000001s)]
*  If you ever got into a business where the owner is behind the counter or a hired hand [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5273.900000000001s)]
*  is behind the counter, you know the difference about when someone feels like they're an owner, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5278.5s)]
*  about how great the service can be, about how powerful the feeling of ownership is. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5281.9800000000005s)]
*  So I love the idea of giving people significant ownership in a company and seeing what happens. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5286.06s)]
*  It's really exciting. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5290.22s)]
*  Bill, thank you for all that you've done. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zv1eXcX2pc&t=5291.580000000001s)]
