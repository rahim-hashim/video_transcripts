# The Future of Bitcoin w/ Michael Saylor (2024) | MOONSHOTS EP #92
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg)
*  Is there a situation or an event that you view that could potentially lead to the collapse of Bitcoin? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=0.0s)]
*  I think the way to understand Bitcoin is everything you learned in economics and about money in your entire life [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=7.28s)]
*  was pseudo-science, you know, and superstitious. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=14.0s)]
*  So I think all the smart money, all the smart people in the world that don't trust the bank, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  don't trust the currency, want to keep their money, they're all discovering Bitcoin. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  It's been quite the journey, buddy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=30.96s)]
*  Quite the journey. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=34.96s)]
*  Yeah, I thought I was just going to retire into obscurity in 2020. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=36.96s)]
*  And then COVID hit, the world turned upside down, everything stopped, and Bitcoin presented itself. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=42.96s)]
*  You know, what I find fascinating, a lot of people don't know this, is you discovered Bitcoin [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=50.96s)]
*  not in 2010 or 2014 or 2018, but as a result of COVID. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=56.16s)]
*  I remember being with you in Miami, you were telling the story, I'm going, that's incredible. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=62.96s)]
*  Yeah, I really, I heard about it back eight, nine years earlier, I think I tweeted very famously in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=67.92s)]
*  2013 that it was interesting, but I thought it would go the way of gambling and get banned. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=77.44s)]
*  And then I forgot that I tweeted that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=83.52s)]
*  And then in August of 2020, I tweeted that I bought $250 million of it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=86.8s)]
*  And at that time, it didn't occur to me that I was the first person to publicly announce that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=95.44s)]
*  I'd spent that much money. And then, you know, on my Twitter, or my ex account now, I have this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=101.2s)]
*  phrase, you know, Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets. And the cyber hornets were all the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=110.0s)]
*  people on the internet, like the person that made that video. That was not me, I did not make that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=115.68s)]
*  video. But they're always doing that. And so one of the hornets scanned every single thing I tweeted [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=120.16s)]
*  in my entire life, and they dredged this up, like, ha ha ha ha ha, you know, look how much money you [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=127.92s)]
*  lost, you could have bought it $100 or something. And I just kind of recycled the Bitcoin trope, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=132.8s)]
*  which as I said, everybody gets Bitcoin the price they deserve. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=139.52s)]
*  That's true. You know, speaking about the ups and downs and so forth, you have extraordinary [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  tolerance for risk and resiliency, I think is the right word. I dredged this up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=156.24s)]
*  On the left is an article from 2000. Lost $6 billion in a day. And then on the right is, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=164.88s)]
*  actually, February, that's the wrong date, 2024, not 2000, where you made similar million dollars [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=176.64s)]
*  in a day. How do you sleep at night with that kind of fluctuation? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=184.64s)]
*  You just got to have a mission, right? You got to have a mission in your life. So [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=190.32s)]
*  you can't really control the fluctuations in the market, you can control your reactions to them. So [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=196.4s)]
*  in this particular case, my view on Bitcoin is the reason to do it is because it represents [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=202.56s)]
*  freedom and sovereignty, truth, integrity, and hope for the world. And that being the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=209.04s)]
*  case, it's going to outlast all of us. So I'm kind of thinking the Bitcoin goes on long after [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  MicroStrategy is gone and MicroStrategy, the company, probably goes on long after I'm gone. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=225.28s)]
*  And my view is if we're remembered for advocating and accelerating the adoption of Bitcoin, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  throughout the world, then that will have been success and I don't need anything else. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=242.88s)]
*  It's amazing. And I'll take the beatings as they come or go in order to get to that end goal, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=246.56s)]
*  because I'm sure it doesn't come without turbulence. But the conviction that you've had [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=253.92s)]
*  that's guided you consistently, right? Does that go to like first principle thinking of physics [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=258.32s)]
*  here of like, this, this is just not going to go down, this is going to go up, there's only [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=263.36s)]
*  going to be so many and so forth. Is that first principle thinking that led you to make this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  commitment in the face of everybody else questioning it? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, I think one of the great things about MIT is that it teaches you to think and also it [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=281.36s)]
*  teaches you to start from first principles and the combination of that and aeronautical engineering, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=288.32000000000005s)]
*  where you have to literally, you have to build a machine that will fly through the air or through [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=293.44s)]
*  space by combining, you know, all manner of engineering. I think that makes you confident. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=298.96s)]
*  My first memory of MIT was, was the materials engineering professor, he walks out and he says, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=308.48s)]
*  here's a tile, it just burned off the space shuttle. And NASA doesn't know why it burned [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=315.76s)]
*  off and we don't know how to fix it. What do you think? And it was 18 year old kids and we're all [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=321.36s)]
*  sit 500 of us, we're sitting in a room and a guy who's consulting for NASA looks at us and he says, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  you know, NASA doesn't know the solution, but what is the solution? Everybody looks at each other [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  and you can see first we're all like, well, did I miss the reading? Like, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=338.72s)]
*  like was this in a reading? And then you're like, and then, then you have this dawning, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=343.2s)]
*  horrifying observation that the answer to this question is not in any book written in the history [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=347.2s)]
*  of the world. And the guy that had NASA with the original problem, sent it to a professor who knows [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=353.28s)]
*  more than you know, who's telling you he doesn't know the answer, but he's asking you. And so first [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=360.32s)]
*  you kind of, you're thinking I didn't read the reading. And then second, you're like scared. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  And then some kid in the front row raises his hand and says, well, you know, have you thought [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=371.12s)]
*  about changing, you know, the lamination on the, on the composites and everybody else looks and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=374.88s)]
*  they're like, the professor's going to call the kid an idiot, right? And we're all afraid. And he [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  goes, no, that's a good idea. That's what I thought too. And we tried that, but that didn't work. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=385.2s)]
*  And then we all go, and then the next kid, you know, raise of the hand, then you think, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=389.84s)]
*  I guess they actually expect us to think for ourselves. And that, and that was how MIT started [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=394.56s)]
*  and it just got, it just continued along that line. And so if anything, when I left school, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=400.32s)]
*  when I left MIT, my thought was you have to work excessively hard, don't be afraid of hard work, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=406.32s)]
*  but you can solve the problem. And that's what they do here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=413.28s)]
*  We were classmates together in unified engineering, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=416.48s)]
*  which is probably one of the toughest courses there. The only way we could get through it was [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=420.88s)]
*  by working in teams on problem sets. I think I probably cheated off your problem sets more [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=426.72s)]
*  than in the way we're out. You're too kind. Let's talk about Bitcoin. So actually I want to talk [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  about abundance, Pete. I have one observation, which is, which is the whole, the whole essence [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=444.48s)]
*  of Bitcoin is about creating perfect money and the discovery of what we call digital scarcity, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=452.16s)]
*  as a, as a digital scarcity, as a commodity basis for sound money. And, and, and one of the, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  another one of the tropes in the community is when money is abundant, everything else is scarce. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=466.88000000000005s)]
*  And when money is scarce, everything else in the society is abundant. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  What's the logic behind that? If you go to Zimbabwe, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=477.6s)]
*  or you go to Venezuela, or you go to any country going through hyperinflation, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  when they print the currency, the currency collapses. As the currency collapses, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  the end, everyone in the economy doesn't want to take the currency anymore. And, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  and you get ripped back to Stone Age border. And so like in Nigeria this week, the Naira went from [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=497.36s)]
*  400 to the dollar to 1600 to the dollar. So in an economy where the currency, I mean, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=505.52s)]
*  that's a 75% currency debasement in a week. When that happens, and I see you in Nigeria, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  and I want to buy your house, you know, next year, well, the issue is, well, with what, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=519.28s)]
*  and what will it be worth next year? You'll buy it today or you won't buy it at all. How do I sign [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=524.48s)]
*  a 12-month contract if the money is going to be worthless in nine months? So there are no term [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=529.92s)]
*  contracts. You know, how do I trade with you if you have to trade with someone else and the supply [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=535.92s)]
*  chain is 18 months long? Right? When the currency unwinds and the assets unwind, the supply chains [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  break. When the supply chains break, specialization of labor breaks down, the entire economy breaks [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=548.4799999999999s)]
*  down. Eventually everyone has to grow their own food, right? You want abundance, you don't actually [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=554.96s)]
*  grow your own food in your backyard, right? Productivity drops by a factor of 100 to 1000 [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=560.64s)]
*  if you can't solve this coincidence of wants problem. So you need sound money and it needs [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  to work across time and space. And the currencies that we use as a medium of exchange, they might [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=573.12s)]
*  be tradable over parts of space. Right now, by the way, it's probably illegal to actually pay [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=580.08s)]
*  someone in a dollar in Nigeria. Really? Yeah. Like so. Just currency controls? Yeah. Capital [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=585.5200000000001s)]
*  control. You see capital controls all over the world, especially when the currencies collapse, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=592.4000000000001s)]
*  the capital controls go in place. So you can't trade money or you can't trade the currency across [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=597.12s)]
*  borders. And of course you certainly can't trade the currency with your future self 10 years from [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  now. And how do you even trade a currency, you know, in collapsing countries you'll find [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=609.04s)]
*  nobody wants to sign a three year contract because the local currency is not going to be worth the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=615.76s)]
*  same amount in three years. So you have a hard time trading in time with counter parties or in [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=621.76s)]
*  space. And so the key to abundance is fixing the money problem. So you have this insight about, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=628.64s)]
*  you know, digital currency, digital property, the, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=636.0s)]
*  how long did it take you from studying this idea to making the decision to buy 250 million worth of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=642.0s)]
*  Bitcoin? I started thinking about it, I guess, late March, April, it took about eight weeks before I, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=648.4s)]
*  four to eight, four to eight weeks of constant thinking before I came to the conclusion it was [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=658.0s)]
*  a good idea. And it was probably, you know, for me to make the decision, I had made the decision [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=662.96s)]
*  personally by late May, I bought $175 million of Bitcoin in late May of 2020. Personally, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=670.4000000000001s)]
*  personally, but that was just me negotiating with myself. And I guess I started probably [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=679.6s)]
*  late March, early April. So that's six weeks to get there. And then we had, we have a public company. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=685.84s)]
*  So for a public company to do something, the officers have to buy in the outside directors [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=693.44s)]
*  have to buy in the accountants, the lawyers have to buy in. So I want to take us there, right? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=699.12s)]
*  So one of your board members, when you're outside board members, great guy, Rick is here with us [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=703.36s)]
*  today, call him out. But you walk in, what was the process of getting a public board [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=706.96s)]
*  to do this? Well, in that case, I actually pull the three most compelling videos on Bitcoin off of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  YouTube, you know, an Andreas Antonopoulos overview of Bitcoin, a debate by Eric Voorhees and Peter [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=726.64s)]
*  Schiff over over Bitcoin versus fiat currency is money. Probably some other background on Bitcoin, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=736.0s)]
*  I put those three together, there's probably three hours of watching. I included some articles, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=744.8s)]
*  some short articles, maybe by by some of the Bitcoin OGs. I sent the package off to each [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=751.44s)]
*  board member, I said, I got some homework for you, it's probably going to take three to five hours [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=759.28s)]
*  for you to read through all this, read through all of it. And then I want to meet with you. And [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=764.56s)]
*  then I set up one on ones with each one of them. And so I met with each one individually, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=768.88s)]
*  I answered their questions. Then after that, we had a group meeting. Then after that, we broke into [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=773.68s)]
*  into committees to study different aspects, the accounting, the disclosures, the whatever. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=780.16s)]
*  And so it was a group process. And of course, the the CFO and the general counsel at the time were [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=785.68s)]
*  also heavily involved. Did they threaten to resign? No. Okay. It was, it was never a question of, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=792.24s)]
*  of do it or don't do it. It was an observation that the world had come to a grinding halt, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=800.64s)]
*  we had $500 million, yielding 0% interest, we were under our stock had hit $90 a share. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=806.8s)]
*  The enterprise value of the company was about $60 a share. $60 a share, you know where the stock is [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  right now. And we had been competing with Microsoft for about a decade. And for all of those of you [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=823.2800000000001s)]
*  who compete with Microsoft, you have an idea of what that's like. They have every company on earth [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=830.1600000000001s)]
*  as their customer, and they can bundle your product into their whatever. So it's not easy [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=836.64s)]
*  competing as Microsoft, we had experience, and we are under pressure from our shareholders. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=841.68s)]
*  You know, it's like, you have half of the market cap of the company is cash, you're earning 0% [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=846.9599999999999s)]
*  interest, you're not beating the cost of capital, the cost of capital is the S&P return. So anybody [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=853.52s)]
*  looks at it says, you're not getting eight, nine, 10% on the capital, you should give it back to us [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  so we can invest it. And so we'd reached a point where the company was looking at a fast death, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=864.88s)]
*  we just sell the company and call it a day, or a slow death, we keep the cash, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=872.0799999999999s)]
*  and we and the stock is dead money. And that means the stock options are dead money. And that was the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=879.3599999999999s)]
*  time when it used to be employees work for you because they liked the community and the schools [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=886.3199999999999s)]
*  in their home. And maybe they were loyal to you because they saw you every day in the office. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  But think about what happened in the second quarter of 2020 when nobody came to the office, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=897.52s)]
*  and they could change jobs and go work for Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft or Google without moving. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=903.52s)]
*  All you do is just repath your zoom account. And so all of a sudden, you're staring at big tech, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=910.88s)]
*  you know, the big tech companies more powerful than most countries and getting more powerful. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=919.52s)]
*  And you've lost the human connection. They don't have to move to San Francisco, they can simply [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=925.12s)]
*  take a job and nobody ever got hired by big tech for less money than they're making working for you. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=932.48s)]
*  So from our point of view, you're on the precipice of a serious like sell the company or just watch [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=941.12s)]
*  all your employees dwindle, you're going to get boiled off. And after the after the good employees [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=947.9200000000001s)]
*  leave, you know, the product will gradually deteriorate, you know, and and you're competing [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=952.72s)]
*  against a digital monopoly that has more power than all but four countries on earth. And so [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=958.24s)]
*  we either do we either do that or do that, or we take a risk. And so we were basically at a point [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  where maybe we should take a risk. Now having said all that, what really happened there is [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=971.44s)]
*  we deliberated it took a long time to deliberate a lot of education. And at the end of the day, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=978.32s)]
*  we ended up announcing that we were going to do a Dutch auction and buy back $250 million of the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=984.6400000000001s)]
*  stock at a premium coincidental with the purchase of Bitcoin. So we didn't just take that risk, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=992.1600000000001s)]
*  we basically said, we're going to take the company on a path you may not agree with, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=998.48s)]
*  but we'll buy you out. And so we were prepared to give up half I had to I had to basically [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1003.04s)]
*  give up pay $250 million for the right to buy $250 million of Bitcoin in August of 2020. Right, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  that's the price we paid that Dutch auction where the stock was about 121 122 we offered to buy all [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1018.7199999999999s)]
*  our shareholders out at 140. We gave them 20 days to think about it. We bought the Bitcoin, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1025.36s)]
*  no company had ever bought that much Bitcoin in it. And by the way, you know, following that only [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1033.1999999999998s)]
*  block and Tesla did it afterwards, but but it was a very rare thing to do. Of course, Bitcoin [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1039.04s)]
*  cooperated by immediately trading down. We bought it we bought it 11,800 and it traded down to 9800 [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  or something. So I was looking like a genius again. Buying the top, the Dutch auction ran, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1053.9199999999998s)]
*  but the stock traded above the 140 price after a day or two, everyone that didn't like the idea [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1060.8799999999999s)]
*  just traded out at one above 140. We had $75 million tendered, we we bought that those shares [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1067.12s)]
*  at 140, we had $175 million left. And we bought Bitcoin with that. And then and so we had basically [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1074.72s)]
*  transformed ourselves into a company with Bitcoin as a Treasury Reserve asset through that capital [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1082.0s)]
*  markets activity, you know, and it was it was in a partnership with the outside investors. When you're [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1087.44s)]
*  a public company, you don't just do it, you have to transparently telegraph it. I just find it incredible [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1092.72s)]
*  the I think the Greek word is the gohanis. But to take no it's a it's the it's the action of a leader [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1099.28s)]
*  who's willing to take a big risk that put the company on its trajectory because it's so easy [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1109.92s)]
*  to ride a company to the ground. It's so easy just to do what everybody expected you to do. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1116.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm curious how many folks here in the room own Bitcoin raise your hand high. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1123.04s)]
*  Okay, so majority of you go home tonight and buy some good for you. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1128.24s)]
*  Everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1134.64s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you love. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1138.08s)]
*  Company is called Fountain Life. And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1143.4399999999998s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians. You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1148.72s)]
*  inside our body. We're all optimists. Until that day when you have a pain in your side, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1154.3999999999999s)]
*  you go to the physician in the emergency room and they say, Listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  you have this stage three or four going on. And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1163.84s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time. But because we never look, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1169.84s)]
*  we don't find out. So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1175.36s)]
*  centers. We have four across the US today. And we're building 20 around the world. These centers [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1182.0s)]
*  give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary CT looking [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1188.0s)]
*  for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive blood workup. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1194.08s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. 150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1200.48s)]
*  our physicians to find any disease at the very beginning when it's solvable. You're going to [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1207.92s)]
*  find out eventually. You might as well find out when you can take action. Fountain Life also has [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1214.16s)]
*  an entire side of therapeutics. We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1219.28s)]
*  add 10, 20 healthy years to your life. And we provide them to you at our centers. So if this is [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1223.6000000000001s)]

*  things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. All right, let's go back to our episode. So we had [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1270.72s)]
*  Kathy Wood on the on the stage last year and she'll be coming back again next year. And Kathy's [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1275.6000000000001s)]
*  prediction was, you know, a million to five million. And it was a good week the last couple of weeks. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1281.8400000000001s)]
*  And I can understand the decision. Well, let me back up a second. So Block and then Tesla bought [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1288.88s)]
*  Bitcoin in their treasury. I remember you having some conversations with Elon about trying to get [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1295.68s)]
*  him to step up even further. Why aren't other companies following suit in a major way? It doesn't [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1300.88s)]
*  mean I think you've made your point extremely well. No, I think the [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1310.24s)]
*  the primary impediment to corporate adoption by publicly traded companies is that indefinite and [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1317.2800000000002s)]
*  intangible accounting is toxic to the P and L and to the balance sheet. So no company with a healthy [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1323.36s)]
*  business that's fairly valued by the market or no company run by a management team that doesn't [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1332.8799999999999s)]
*  have voting control would ever adopt indefinite and tangible accounting because what it does is [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1340.0s)]
*  it doesn't just obscure your balance sheet. It also obscures your P and L and it even [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1346.6399999999999s)]
*  it even it even mixes investment gains with operating gains and investment losses with [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1350.8s)]
*  operating losses. So it in essence renders 100 pages of financial irrelevant. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1357.28s)]
*  And the current accounting is you can't even proform it out. So not only does it make all of your [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1363.84s)]
*  all of your accounting non-comparable across periods, it makes all your accounting non-comparable [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1370.48s)]
*  across competitors and it also ties your hands with the ability to explain that. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1376.0s)]
*  So you're not going to see a see you would do it because your choice was a fast death, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1384.24s)]
*  a slow death. And if you're looking at a fast death or a slow death and if you had voting control [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1390.64s)]
*  of the company and if you tried everything else then you would do it. So we were a unique company, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1397.2s)]
*  a unique place and by the way I don't think we would have done it if it hadn't been for COVID. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1403.92s)]
*  If the world had not shut down I don't think we needed COVID to hit. You need wars right. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1408.8000000000002s)]
*  People will say I don't believe in flying an airplane and a war hits and they start embracing [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1417.44s)]
*  air power. People will tell you they're not going to embrace you know whatever it is until the war [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1422.16s)]
*  hits. So we had a war, the economy shut down and then we had the central bank take interest rates [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1428.4s)]
*  to zero but they didn't just take them to zero. They also you know we had the head of the central [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1437.44s)]
*  bank give a speech saying I'm not even thinking about thinking about raising interest rates until [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1443.44s)]
*  the year 2024. So they took them to zero and basically signaled they were going to peg them [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1448.16s)]
*  at zero for four years. Now that didn't quite happen right you know. A lot of banks wished it [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1453.84s)]
*  had happened. I mean the people that believed it got caught on the wrong side of that trade and [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1460.48s)]
*  Silicon Valley Bank and the like crashed because they believed what was said. But the point is [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1465.28s)]
*  there was a crisis. We had a need. We were a very special company in the right time at the right place. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1472.48s)]
*  I had dinner with a minister from a middle eastern nation I wouldn't say who [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1478.6399999999999s)]
*  and during dinner he was convincing me that the US government was going to shut down bitcoin. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1483.12s)]
*  When? This was [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1495.04s)]
*  three months ago. Okay yeah well I think that the biggest challenge of bitcoin is that the industries [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1499.12s)]
*  refers to it as a cryptocurrency and oftentimes people refer to it as a digital currency and [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1506.64s)]
*  there's a very vocal contingent that wants it to be a currency and the rest of the world doesn't [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1514.16s)]
*  really understand money. So that being the case let's view this from first principles. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1522.64s)]
*  Money's economic energy. If you want to store your economic energy you put it in assets [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1532.08s)]
*  and the assets have different half-lives with which they store the energy. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1538.48s)]
*  Any textbook economist will say money is a store of value medium exchange unit of account and they [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1544.1599999999999s)]
*  stop and they don't really think much beyond that and then they'll like bark at you that you don't [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1549.6s)]
*  have money because you don't have this is not good for a medium exchange but nobody really thinks [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1554.3999999999999s)]
*  about what they just said. So if you thought about it you would realize that about 120 currencies [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1558.64s)]
*  in the world are mediums of exchange. The peso is a medium exchange, the naira is a medium of exchange. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1566.8000000000002s)]
*  So weak currencies the Turkish lira, the Lebanese pound, they're mediums of exchange. You can find a [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1573.5200000000002s)]
*  lot of them. The Venezuelan boulevard medium exchange but if you go to South America you'll [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1579.8400000000001s)]
*  find that it's not a unit of account. If you go to Argentina the unit of account is the US dollar [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1587.12s)]
*  and they think in terms of dollars. So there are only three currencies in the world that are units [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1593.04s)]
*  of account. They're the euro, the dollar, and the CNY and so why is that? Because the mediums of [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1597.04s)]
*  exchange are weak currencies inflating at 14 to 24 percent a year. They're losing their economic [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1606.2399999999998s)]
*  energy over three to five years. The half-life of the money in the asset is about five years or less. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1612.32s)]
*  Sometimes it's only five months. Like in the naira they lost 75 percent of their energy last week. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1619.36s)]
*  So the medium exchange only is dictated by the government as legal tender. Every government [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1626.8s)]
*  that's functional will dictate their currency as a medium exchange and enforce that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1635.6799999999998s)]
*  The unit of account is generally the dollar, the euro, and currencies pegged to the dollar. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1641.92s)]
*  And the store of value, well nobody in the United States thinks the dollar is a store of value. No [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1650.56s)]
*  rich person. If you look at wealthy people they would say the store of value, if they're really [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1657.76s)]
*  wealthy, if they're billionaires they own buildings, blocks, huge properties, or they own the [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1664.56s)]
*  Patriots. They own a sports team, a soccer club, or they own a collection of Picasso's. That's what [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1671.44s)]
*  the wealthy use as store of value. The middle class store of value is the Vanguard 500 or S&P index. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1677.52s)]
*  It's SPY. It's basically been the S&P or QQQ. It's basically a diversified portfolio [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1684.56s)]
*  of stocks. And that's been the status quo since 30, 40 years ago when Bogle did that. So [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1691.2s)]
*  the world today consists of 120 mediums of exchange, about three, four units of account. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1698.4s)]
*  No currencies or stores of value. And if you say to someone, what do you think about Bitcoin as [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1706.96s)]
*  digital currency? They say, well I think it threatens the dollar. I hate it. If you said, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1712.5600000000002s)]
*  what do you think about Bitcoin as digital property? I'm going to buy it instead of buying [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1717.04s)]
*  a building in Des Moines. They're like, oh have at it. If you simply conceptualize it as property, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1721.04s)]
*  which is store of value, all of the objections, all of the straw man objections, like it's used [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1727.12s)]
*  for money laundering, it's not legal tender, I can't buy coffee with it, it's not fast enough, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1734.72s)]
*  it's not private enough. All of these things disappear because it's about as stupid as saying [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1742.48s)]
*  to Bob Kraft, you can't buy a cup of coffee with the New England Patriots by breaking off one of [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1747.52s)]
*  your tight ends. And you can't buy a cup of coffee with your building in Boston. Of course I can't. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1753.76s)]
*  You can't buy a cup of coffee with part of a Picasso, the lower left corner either. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1761.52s)]
*  But wealthy people have been using them as a store of value and as money for 500 years. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1766.8s)]
*  Let's talk about real estate as a store of value. It too can sublimate. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1772.8s)]
*  Yeah, so when you say, what is the question? What do I think of it? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1781.04s)]
*  Real estate itself as a store of value. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1786.96s)]
*  So what I think is, of course, if you just describe Bitcoin as digital property, a store of value, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1789.2s)]
*  all of the popular criticisms go away and everyone that hates Bitcoin would completely [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1796.08s)]
*  flip once they understood it isn't a currency. So people just ought to say it's a property, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1800.72s)]
*  it's not a currency, and every one of those criticisms and weaknesses is no longer relevant. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1805.76s)]
*  The second thing I say on store of value is, it's kind of silly to fight to be a digital currency [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1813.04s)]
*  because there's $900 trillion of wealth in the world, $400 trillion of it wants to be store of [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1818.24s)]
*  value, only $1 trillion wants to be a medium of exchange. Go to a wealthy person and ask them [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1824.56s)]
*  what percentage of their wealth is in their checking account. It's like 1% maybe? No wealthy [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1831.9199999999998s)]
*  person is holding more than 1% in ready cash. So it's not even worth fighting for. Like you can [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1838.6399999999999s)]
*  fight the government to be a currency, but you're just fighting someone that's got guns and police [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1846.48s)]
*  force, etc. The store of value is the use case that matters. And another word for store of value [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1851.92s)]
*  is property. And the third word for store of value is capital. And if we just thought this is digital [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1860.0800000000002s)]
*  capital, now you get to profound idea, right? Which is there's capital in the economy, where is [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1865.92s)]
*  it sitting? Well, it's sitting in buildings, we've monetized buildings, a rich person goes and I [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1873.8400000000001s)]
*  know a lot of wealthy people, they make a fortune. And what they do is they just go buy real estate [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1881.36s)]
*  that they don't need. They buy apartments they don't need. I mean, everybody can pick up the [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1886.3999999999999s)]
*  paper and they can see examples. People buy trophy assets and they buy buildings and they buy land, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1891.4399999999998s)]
*  they don't need land buying things. So real estate is a way to fight inflation or to preserve capital [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1897.36s)]
*  over the long term. Another way to do it is I invested in a company or I attempt to pick the [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1905.52s)]
*  right stock, a magnificent seven stock. A third way to do it is with art. I mean, Velasquez in [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1911.76s)]
*  the 16th century travels from Spain to Italy, he wants to buy all the great art and he's got the [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1919.36s)]
*  King of Spain's checkbook and an infinite budget. And he complains, nobody will sell him the art, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1927.36s)]
*  because all the rich people in Italy are using it as store of value so they can flee with their [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1934.48s)]
*  portable scarce desirable property when they have to leave town or they're using it as an inflation [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1940.1599999999999s)]
*  hedge. And I kid you not, go read Will Durant's history of the Renaissance and he notes, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1946.72s)]
*  it's an inflation hedge and a store in value 500 years ago. So that's the way people think. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1955.52s)]
*  Why is Bitcoin better? It's better because the problem with storing billions of dollars [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1962.16s)]
*  in a building is the building can't run and the building can't hide and everybody knows a rich [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1969.52s)]
*  person owns the building and therefore we're going to tax them. I mean, I just give you a simple [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1975.8400000000001s)]
*  question. I'm going to give you a billion dollars right now, I'm going to drop you in Africa. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1980.8000000000002s)]
*  What building in Africa are you going to buy in what country and hold for a hundred years? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1985.76s)]
*  A hundred years. Not to disparage Africa, there's not a single piece of real estate [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1990.8s)]
*  and a single country in Africa that any of you would be wise to purchase if you had to hold it [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=1998.8s)]
*  a hundred years. On the other hand, if you held a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin in Africa, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2004.72s)]
*  you'd probably still have the money a hundred years from now. And if you lost it, it's because [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2010.24s)]
*  you lost it, not because it was taken from you. Everybody walks past the biggest tower in the [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2014.96s)]
*  city and they look up and they say, there's a person with more money than me. And then they [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2021.92s)]
*  think, why don't we tax them? What are they going to do? Move the building? Right? You're not going [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2027.3600000000001s)]
*  to move the building. And so then they walk past the parking lot and they think, well, let's just [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2032.0800000000002s)]
*  go ahead and put a zoning restriction on that. So you can't actually build on that parking lot. So [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2036.64s)]
*  at the end of the day, your property is getting rent controlled, expropriated, taxed, et cetera. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2041.92s)]
*  And so it's the best idea in the 20th century. I think that's the important point. But we're [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2048.88s)]
*  not in the 20th century. We're in the 21st century. I wanted to get that point across [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2056.64s)]
*  because a lot of people think about real estate as somewhat unique real estate on the beach, on [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2060.88s)]
*  park, on Central Park. But it has those issues. I'd like to take the conversation [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2068.24s)]
*  to Bitcoin as a technology, lightning rewards. Some time ago, you spoke about [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2076.4799999999996s)]
*  a Bitcoin lightning reward mechanism out of MicroStrategy, which I thought was brilliant. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2087.2799999999997s)]
*  Would you go there? Well, I think Bitcoin layer one is all about creating [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2094.08s)]
*  monetary integrity in the base layer. And it's meant to be a settlement network for high powered [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2105.84s)]
*  money. So in essence, where you see it going is trillions and then hundreds of trillions of dollars [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2113.92s)]
*  in a network. It needs to be extremely robust. But the way you get robust is you create a block [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2121.92s)]
*  every 10 minutes and you put thousands of transactions every 10 minutes. So it's [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2128.8s)]
*  destined to move blocks of money, $10 million at a time, $100 million at a time. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2135.04s)]
*  And for that, it's pretty good. You can imagine banks, corporations settling with each other [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2142.4s)]
*  at that speed. And if you want to move a billion dollars from New York to Tokyo, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2148.3199999999997s)]
*  spending $10 seems pretty cheap and doing it in half an hour is not a big deal. But if you want [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2153.04s)]
*  to get to transactional applications, you can't do it on the base layer. There's two approaches. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2158.64s)]
*  One approach is you change the base layer to give it higher throughput. But the problem with that is [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2164.3199999999997s)]
*  that you're changing the underlying scarcity parameters, which undermines the stability of [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2170.4s)]
*  the system and the integrity and the security of the system. So ultimately, you make the network [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2177.36s)]
*  more fragile. And so most things don't scale all at one layer. You scale in layers. So lightning [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2182.56s)]
*  is the most famous of the layer twos. And really, it's an example of an open protocol layer two [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2189.04s)]
*  system that sits on top of Bitcoin and it's channel-based. So the idea is if I want to move [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2196.8s)]
*  $10 back and forth a million times an hour, I probably don't need to put the entire trillion [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2204.48s)]
*  dollar network at risk. I could probably just set up a channel that had $5 million on this side or [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2210.7200000000003s)]
*  $5 million on this side, and I could move back and forth. And then I'll settle on the base layer as [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2218.48s)]
*  I open and close the channels. So the brilliance of that approach is you're still using Satoshi's [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2224.48s)]
*  or underlying Bitcoin as gas. So you've got an ethical network and an economically sound network. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2232.48s)]
*  But you've created an infinitely scalable network because once you go to this channel approach, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2241.12s)]
*  there's no reason why you can't clear millions of transactions a second. And so lightning is [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2247.6s)]
*  the layer two to clear millions of transactions a second thing. The idea of Bitcoin rewards is if [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2254.0s)]
*  you want to give people small micro payments or very, very rapid payments for engagement, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2260.0s)]
*  you show up to a meeting, you get rewarded with something of monetary value. If I want to come [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2266.8s)]
*  to offer people a reward to come and register on my website, I do it using an open network that [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2274.32s)]
*  isn't subject to the constraints of the fiat credit system. I do imagine that we're going to [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2282.0s)]
*  very quickly head to a world where everybody's got a digital wallet and is transacting in the same way [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2287.28s)]
*  we have a leather wallet in our pocket. And I love the vision that you had. Like if you show up for [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2292.96s)]
*  the HR meeting on time, you get a certain number of Satoshis. If you turn in your report on time, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2298.08s)]
*  if you perform at this level, so you get what you incentivize. And the idea that this is an [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2304.32s)]
*  incentivization process. I keep on waiting for X to announce wallets and an incentive plan like [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2310.72s)]
*  that. There's a profound statement made by JP Morgan a hundred years ago. He said gold is money, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2318.7999999999997s)]
*  everything else is credit. And just like first principles, most people don't understand what [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2325.3599999999997s)]
*  money is. Money is a bearer instrument. Most people don't understand what credit is. Credit is when [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2331.04s)]
*  you have an IOU from a counterparty and they may or may not honor the IOU. So what we have today in [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2336.16s)]
*  the internet is you have a lot of profound applications that are digital transformation [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2343.52s)]
*  of information. We have figured out how to digitally transform photos and music and books and [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2350.7999999999997s)]
*  things like that. But we haven't implemented digital money. So whenever you pay anybody [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2359.84s)]
*  on the internet, you're paying with credit, not with money. And the problem with paying with credit [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2366.8s)]
*  is Visa, MasterCard, your bank, the correspondent bank, the central banks. There's a stack of seven [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2372.32s)]
*  counterparties in between me and you. And that means that if I wanted to give you 50 cents, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2381.44s)]
*  let's just say I want to move any amount of money around. If I want to move a dollar around, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2388.32s)]
*  every time I move it, there's a 30 to 60 day settlement delay and there's a 2.5% fee. So when [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2393.28s)]
*  I move the money 40 times, it took 48 months. It takes four years to move the money from 40 people [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2402.7200000000003s)]
*  in the room. If you just started moving any amount of money, it would be four years before it finally [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2411.44s)]
*  settles and all the money would be gone because it would be like a 100% commission you would pay [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2417.12s)]
*  to the banks. So the problem with the credit networks are they're brittle, they're slow, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2425.8399999999997s)]
*  they're expensive. And by the way, if you're an AI bot, you can't get a credit card. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2432.88s)]
*  And if you're, and so robots aren't people, AIs aren't people, but you know, and I'm going to make [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2439.6000000000004s)]
*  fun of them because Bitcoin gives AIs in cyberspace sovereignty. If you want to release [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2446.5600000000004s)]
*  a service powered by an AI into the ether, outside the control of a person, a government, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2455.1200000000003s)]
*  a company, you're going to need to finance it with money, digital money, which means Bitcoin. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2463.2s)]
*  So AIs aren't people yet and Bitcoin will give them sovereignty of sorts, but people aren't people [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2470.0s)]
*  because 6 billion people on the planet, they don't have credit. Like I dare you to try to send money [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2476.8799999999997s)]
*  to someone in Africa on Saturday, or try to cross borders, try to send some money to someone in [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2482.7999999999997s)]
*  China, see how it works out. Right. So, and by the way, that's the countries shut down at the border. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2490.56s)]
*  But even when each within each country, most people, a lot of people don't have credit card. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2499.2799999999997s)]
*  So Bitcoin is money. Everything else is credit. And you cannot build the 21st century cyber economy [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2504.96s)]
*  if you don't have money. Money needs to move at the speed of light and lightning is an approach. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2517.52s)]
*  There's a couple, there's a bunch of other approaches. So, I mean, Bitcoin is the financial [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2523.6s)]
*  side of the internet that didn't exist in the 1990s. It's the profound big idea is Google, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2528.2400000000002s)]
*  Facebook, Apple, Amazon. They made all their money based on the digital transformation of [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2534.48s)]
*  information apps, which are non-conservative in the thermodynamic physical sense. They are [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2539.76s)]
*  non-conservative. I can give every one of you my music file. Whereas we're now moving into a new [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2546.32s)]
*  transition. I think it's a 30 year transition. It's digital energy. It is, it is, it's digital [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2553.1200000000003s)]
*  energy, digital money, digital capital, digital property. These are all just different words for [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2559.92s)]
*  things that are conservative in cyberspace. If I give you a billion dollars, I have to lose it. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2566.48s)]
*  I can't give everybody a billion dollars. Right? Some, you know, there has to be, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2571.52s)]
*  there has to be a conservation of energy or conservation of money here. And none of the [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2578.48s)]
*  great companies have been built on digital energy or digital monetary apps. But if you think about [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2585.12s)]
*  the next set of applications, the ones where, where I can take a block of a billion dollars of [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2592.4s)]
*  capital in cyberspace and I can decompose it to a million smaller blocks, send it to a million [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2600.08s)]
*  different places in one hour, recompose it three hours later, chop it into a bunch of $10 segments, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2606.72s)]
*  pull that back, oscillate it, program it, transfer it, or just store it for, how do you store money [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2613.52s)]
*  for 50 years? Right? And the metaphor I give you as an aeronautical engineer, which I think Elon [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2622.32s)]
*  would like and I think you'll like, is it's the difference between you launch something and it [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2629.04s)]
*  goes ballistic and comes back to earth. Suborbital versus orbital. And you launch it and it reaches [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2634.96s)]
*  escape velocity and it goes orbital. One, one is in space forever and the other is in space [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2639.84s)]
*  for a blink of an eye. And what we're trying to do is put energy in cyberspace or put money in [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2647.2799999999997s)]
*  cyberspace, reach escape velocity such that it lasts forever with zero friction. It's like [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2653.2s)]
*  hype superconducting. Everybody, I want to take a break from our episode to tell you about an [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2662.08s)]
*  amazing company on a mission to prevent and reverse chronic disease by decoding your biology. The [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2666.3199999999997s)]

*  you optimize your gut microbiome, your oral microbiome, and your cellular health. As you [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2678.24s)]
*  probably know, your microbiome is a collection of trillions of microbes that live in your gut [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2683.7599999999998s)]
*  and mouth. These microbiomes influence everything, your digestion, immunity, mood, weight, and many [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2689.52s)]
*  other aspects of your health. But not all microbes are good for you. Some can cause inflammation, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2695.9199999999996s)]
*  toxins, and actually lead to chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and even cancer. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2702.3199999999997s)]

*  health. Because of the data they collect and the AI engine they've built, it gets better every single [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2737.68s)]
*  day. I love getting health scores and seeing how my diet and lifestyle affects my microbiome and my [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2744.3199999999997s)]

*  Trust me, you won't regret it. All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2775.44s)]
*  Let's talk about the path towards what seems to be inevitable, for which there is tremendous [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2778.96s)]
*  social disbelief, institutional resistance, manipulation. So let's say the decade of [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2787.68s)]
*  2000 to 2018-19 was still the very entrepreneurial, highly risk area. We started to have adoption by [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2796.56s)]
*  wealthier individuals and we finally moved into institutions, the release of the ETFs. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2809.36s)]
*  And I talk about going from deceptive to disruptive and we're in that near the curve. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2820.56s)]
*  Right? I mean, so this is an example of the 60s, right? We've digitized money, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2824.1600000000003s)]
*  you've dematerialized it, right? You effectively demonetize the ability to transmit [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2827.6s)]
*  and you've democratized access to it. And it's going from deceptive to disruptive. What is the, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2833.84s)]
*  is there a final card to flip, domino to fall? Is it governments beyond El Salvador adopting this? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2841.52s)]
*  You know, I think 2020 to 2024 was, you know, the, it was the, I don't know, high volatility, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2851.2799999999997s)]
*  high uncertainty. It's like that early stage of institutional adoption, but really we start [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2863.52s)]
*  mainstream institutional adoption. I would date it to January 2024 with the approval of the ETFs, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2869.92s)]
*  the spot ETFs. And I think it runs, we have about a 10 year gold rush. It runs to 2034 November. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2875.36s)]
*  Between 2024 and 2034, we will have mined 99% of all the Bitcoin. So Bitcoin becomes for all [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2883.44s)]
*  practical purposes fixed by November of 2024. The last 1% comes out over a hundred years. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2893.28s)]
*  Okay. So we, we, we have this 42 quarter period where at the beginning of the period, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2901.2799999999997s)]
*  what percentage are we at now? Right now we're like 94%. So you've got, you've got, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2908.8799999999997s)]
*  you think it's not much, but I mean, 5% is a lot over 10 years compared to 1% over a hundred years. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2918.0s)]
*  So there's actually still Bitcoin available for sale right now. The miners have to sell it. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2925.28s)]
*  So at the beginning of this period in Q1, we're in Q1 now, if you go to January 1st, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2931.1200000000003s)]
*  no institution could buy it even if they wanted to, it just wasn't on their radar. And so you [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2936.5600000000004s)]
*  really have 42 quarters of people learning what it is, studying it. It takes 10 hours to scratch [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2944.5600000000004s)]
*  the surface and it takes a hundred hours before you get a degree of comfort. Most people, you know, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2951.84s)]
*  once they get past the age of 40, they don't want to spend a hundred hours learning a new thing. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2957.6000000000004s)]
*  It's, it's very rare. So you've got Wall Street firms spinning up massive education apparatus. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2962.88s)]
*  You've, you've got a whole set of stages of adoption. First, can I buy it? Then is it on [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2969.6800000000003s)]
*  the approved list for solicited sale? Then it is on the approved list for unsolicited sale. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2977.04s)]
*  Is it marginable? Can I borrow against it? Is it optionable? Can I hedge it? Is it recommended? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2982.32s)]
*  Is it structural? Is it built into a fund? That's like seven layers of adoption. People take a year [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2988.96s)]
*  to think about each of those layers. There's a hundred powerful entities that control huge amounts [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=2995.2s)]
*  of money that'll go through that in the Western world. So I think we're in this, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3002.16s)]
*  this institutional education stage and in 2034, it'll simply be the new thing. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3007.6s)]
*  Right now it's like, it's like the scary exotic thing for most people. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3017.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. My mom asked me what she should be doing with her, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3024.64s)]
*  her mandatory distributions. And I said, buy the Bitcoin ATF. Right. Talk to me one second about, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3027.84s)]
*  I don't want you to give financial advice, but I do want you to speak to, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3038.32s)]
*  how do I put this? How should a person think about what percentage of their wealth they've put here? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3045.1200000000003s)]
*  I think it depends upon where you live, who you are, what your, what your life situation is. And [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3053.4399999999996s)]
*  also whether you're a corporation, a charity, a government, a family, an individual that matters [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3062.3999999999996s)]
*  too. So for example, if you were asking me for that advice for a business owner in Nigeria right [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3069.2799999999997s)]
*  now, I would say most. I would say, can the question you got to ask yourself is, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3078.32s)]
*  can I trust the government? Can I trust the bank? Can I trust the currency? And, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3086.32s)]
*  and can I leave with my stuff? So if you're saying to me, Mike, should I buy a building in, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3092.8s)]
*  a building in Nigeria or, or should I buy a business or should I buy a diversified portfolio? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3100.48s)]
*  Would I recommend a diversified portfolio of Venezuelan stocks or a diversified portfolio [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3107.6s)]
*  of Cuban stocks? Like it really depends on where you live. North Korea, Cuba are kind of, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3114.0s)]
*  are kind of simple all through Africa. If you lived in Egypt, the currency is unwinding. If you [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3119.2s)]
*  follow the Turkish lira, the Turkish lira has gone from seven lira to the dollar to 32 lira to the [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3125.6s)]
*  dollar in 36 months. Let's make believe we're living in the US or a European. Okay. And [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3131.52s)]
*  and if you're, and if you're 70 years old and you're retired and you don't expect to ever have [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3137.2s)]
*  to flee for your life, then you probably should buy the ETF. And if you're 20 years old and you've [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3142.64s)]
*  got your entire life ahead of you and you think you might want to relocate to a different country [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3149.12s)]
*  and you don't, you can't predict it, then generally you're better to buy the underlying asset. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3153.6s)]
*  Some, some people should buy the, buy the Bitcoin in self custody. Some people should buy the Bitcoin [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3159.3599999999997s)]
*  and they should institutional custody. Some people should buy the ETF. And then if we flip [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3165.6s)]
*  the companies, there are companies where it's illegal for them, you know, to, to say self custody. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3171.2s)]
*  There are companies where there are, there are investment companies where they can't buy certain [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3177.92s)]
*  commodities, but they could buy security. So, so the real issue is what's the entity and then [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3183.52s)]
*  what's your time horizon? As a general rule, the longer your time horizon, the more you would [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3189.84s)]
*  prefer to hold the, the money that the underlying commodity asset, because if you hold the asset, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3196.88s)]
*  you can transfer it to any counterparty in the world. You can custody it anywhere. You can self [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3203.76s)]
*  custody and it, and it doesn't come with a taxable event. Let's make, nice to make believe you're [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3209.36s)]
*  speaking to 400 CEOs in the room who are asking the question about, you know, I've got. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3214.08s)]
*  Okay. I'm going to give you a very simple observation. Everybody looks at Bitcoin and [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3226.08s)]
*  they think, well, how do I create the next cash app or the next mobile app or the next fidelity [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3231.7599999999998s)]
*  or the next Coinbase or the next whatever? And they, they think really hard about that or, or [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3238.4s)]
*  how do I, how do I topple JP Morgan? It's like, that's a very difficult thing to do. I give you [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3243.52s)]
*  a very simple idea. You have a treasury in your company. If you put your treasury into sovereign [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3249.52s)]
*  debt, you're going to yield 5% pre-tax, 3% after tax, and you're not going to beat the cost of [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3257.36s)]
*  capital. The cost of capital right now is 8 to 10% in the U S easy. So if that's the case, your [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3263.92s)]
*  treasury is a liability, which means that any rational person would look at you and say, you [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3271.68s)]
*  should decapitalize. You should give all, you should run on the minimum working capital or [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3275.8399999999997s)]
*  negative working capital, and you should run on debt. But I'll give you another idea. If you [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3280.96s)]
*  actually are investing in something you expect to go up 20 to 40% a year for the next decade, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3286.08s)]
*  you're beating the cost of capital by a factor of two. That means the right thing to do is go back [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3290.56s)]
*  to your venture capitalist or your bank and just raise a hundred million dollars that you don't [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3295.2s)]
*  need and buy Bitcoin with it. Because if the business you're running doesn't work, you will [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3300.08s)]
*  have a business that's growing 20 to 30% a year scalably for the next 30 years. That will work. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3307.68s)]
*  You'll double the hundred million two times in the next six years. So you'll be 200, 400 million. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3315.7599999999998s)]
*  In six years, when the thing that you're doing right now doesn't work, you're going to have a [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3321.52s)]
*  business that's growing 20% a year off a $400 million base, which is a monopoly. So most, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3325.44s)]
*  I think the number one, I mean, this is a simple hack, but every venture capitalist in the world [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3331.36s)]
*  is getting two in 20. They're getting a 2% management fee and a 20% participation. And [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3338.64s)]
*  their mandate is they have to invest in operating businesses that are private. And if they were to [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3344.32s)]
*  go and buy a billion dollars of Bitcoin with limited partner capital, their limited partners [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3350.48s)]
*  will say, are you crazy? I could have bought the Bitcoin. So the VC can't buy Bitcoin, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3355.04s)]
*  which is the risk-free return of 20, 30% a year. The VC can give you the a hundred million dollars. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3360.48s)]
*  You can buy the Bitcoin. They end up with debt and a private company. You end up with a hundred, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3367.04s)]
*  200, $500 million business growing 20, 30% a year. That's scalable that you run with yourself and [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3375.2s)]
*  your CFO. It's good for them. They're going to make a fortune. They want to invest the money. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3380.0s)]
*  The real problem in the world, and by the way, this is back to the Dow of Steve and the Dow of [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3387.84s)]
*  Steve, there's a guy sitting on the bed and he's smoking marijuana and someone's saying, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3393.84s)]
*  well, you know, like, why aren't you out there doing something? And he says, doing stuff is [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3398.48s)]
*  highly overrated. Okay. So here's the big idea, which is there's a couple hundred trillion dollars [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3402.4s)]
*  of capital in the world that's debasing at 10% a year right now. And the big idea is just stop [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3410.96s)]
*  investing in toxic money, right? If you simply flip your treasury to something accreting at 10% a year. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3417.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. You see, it's like everybody wants to like do, they want to hire a hundred people and do a [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3425.04s)]
*  lot of stuff that's risky, but really that here's the, this is very painful, but it's, if I told you [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3435.68s)]
*  the water that you're giving your kids is toxic and it's full of pathogens. And that's why half [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3446.96s)]
*  of your children died. And you said, well, what's the big idea? I would say, give your kids clean [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3452.96s)]
*  water. Is that easy? Yeah. And if I said the food, well, the food's not cooked and there are worms [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3458.08s)]
*  in it and pathogens, and that's why you're dying. What's the big idea? Eat clean food, right? I mean, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3465.12s)]
*  that whole idea is what about clean air, clean air, clean the food, clean the, here's the one, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3472.32s)]
*  all my doctors, they want to give me bad drugs and bleed me whenever I sneeze. What's the big idea? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3479.7599999999998s)]
*  Stop taking the bad drugs and stop letting them bleed you. Okay. So if you're running a business [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3485.6s)]
*  and you're running a business on cash, the cash is losing 8% of its value a year. You're basically [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3492.7999999999997s)]
*  bleeding out energy on your balance sheet right now. And the simple idea for max performance is [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3500.48s)]
*  turn your balance sheet into an asset. Anybody could do it. And what happens? Well, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3508.08s)]
*  the micro strategy story is we had a $600 million enterprise value with $600 million of cash, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3515.12s)]
*  which was a liability. What do we do? We flipped it to be $600 million of Bitcoin [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3520.96s)]
*  and a $600 million enterprise. And then the Bitcoin kept growing. And then Bitcoin's been going up [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3526.4s)]
*  40% a year. Bitcoin is going, I can't tell you what it will do, but I can tell you it will outperform [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3531.68s)]
*  the S&P 500 over time. That I'm quite sure of. So you flip your balance sheet to become an asset. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3537.84s)]
*  And today the enterprise value of the company is $30 billion. The stock's up by a factor of 10, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3547.6800000000003s)]
*  the equity market cap's up by a factor of 20, and the enterprise value is up by a factor of 40. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3555.1200000000003s)]
*  It took 42 months. Not four years. I haven't graduated from my senior year in Bitcoin. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3560.64s)]
*  I'm halfway through my senior year in Bitcoin. But the profound idea is [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3568.72s)]
*  every company in the world has toxic assets on its balance sheet. They're all liabilities. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3577.2s)]
*  And we've taught the conventional wisdom in corporate finance is if you have capital, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3584.8s)]
*  give it back and dividend it out. Facebook is buying back $50 billion of their stock and [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3591.2000000000003s)]
*  dividend out billions of their stock. Apple is buying back their stock and dividend out their [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3596.88s)]
*  stock. Scratch your head and think about this a second. I'm going to apply this to Harvard and MIT. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3601.76s)]
*  Give back the endowment and just raise the cost of the tuition 20% a year and stack twice as many [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3608.0800000000004s)]
*  students per class. And that's how you fix the university. Right? Not no. Right? How about this [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3615.36s)]
*  is an idea for your family. I want you to take all the money your family has. I want you to give it [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3622.48s)]
*  away to charity. And I just want you to tell your wife, your husband, your kids just to work harder [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3627.6000000000004s)]
*  and ask for a 15% raise next year. And that's how you're going to fix your family. They're both [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3634.0s)]
*  pretty silly. Right? You would never in a million years have that as your strategy. We give up all [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3640.48s)]
*  the capital and work harder. But you know what the corporate playbook is? Give up all the capital, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3647.36s)]
*  raise your prices, work harder, grow your cash flows by 15% a year, and then you'll be fine. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3653.68s)]
*  And you know, that's why 99% of the companies fail. That's why the life expectancy of a [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3661.4399999999996s)]
*  corporation is 10 years. And you know what? I mean, Harvard, Oxford, Yale, they lasted more [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3667.3599999999997s)]
*  than 10 years. Did they do it by raising their prices 10% a year and working harder? No. In fact, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3674.0s)]
*  there's not much productivity boost in any of those places in 500 years. So here's the profound [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3681.2799999999997s)]
*  idea, which is, you know, if we adopted a different financial model in corporations, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3687.68s)]
*  you're going to have companies last for hundreds of years. You don't have to die, right? For example, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3693.7599999999998s)]
*  you're a dentist. You know, why do I have to raise my prices 10 or 20% a year to be viewed [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3699.8399999999997s)]
*  as successful as a dentist? Right? It's like, it's because I'll tell you why, because we keep [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3707.3599999999997s)]
*  expanding the currency supply by 10%, which means the price of everything you want to buy goes up [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3713.68s)]
*  by 10%, which means you have to grow your cash flows by 10%. And that's why the magnificent seven [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3719.2s)]
*  generate all the returns in the S&P 500. And there are 493 companies that return nothing, zero, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3727.12s)]
*  right? And by the way, it's not their fault, right? We blame them. We blame the companies like we [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3736.3999999999996s)]
*  blame the workers for not working harder. It's not their fault. You cannot outwork inflation. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3742.88s)]
*  And we're back to this issue of if the person that runs the currency or the money printer just [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3750.7200000000003s)]
*  keeps printing 20% more money or 10% more money a year, you just stop the heart. You basically [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3755.6800000000003s)]
*  create a heart attack for every worker in the economy. And so my advice to anybody who's a CEO [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3764.2400000000002s)]
*  is don't work harder, work smarter, but really you're in a rowboat. You're trying to row, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3770.16s)]
*  the wind is blowing, get yourself a sail, put the sail up and let the wind blow you. Instead of [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3777.8399999999997s)]
*  trying to row across the Atlantic, you're not going to make it. How many folks here right now [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3784.7999999999997s)]
*  in the back of their mind, they're thinking, as soon as I get home, I'm going to look at putting [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3789.7599999999998s)]
*  a chunk of my treasury or a chunk of my personal into Bitcoin. Can you raise your hand if that's a [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3794.8799999999997s)]
*  conversation that you're having with yourself right now? So right in 2014, I gave everybody [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3799.6s)]
*  in the room here Bitcoin as a gift. We had a Bitcoin ATM. And you have no idea how many people [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3805.04s)]
*  came to me years later saying, remember the piece of paper you gave me? Can I have a copy of it? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3814.3199999999997s)]
*  No, but you're getting the equivalent right now. Right? You're getting the equivalent right now, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3819.6s)]
*  which is to say, if you can appreciate the logic here, the first principle thinking that Michael [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3826.4s)]
*  is putting forward, then you probably are thinking about going back and making that change. Now, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3835.68s)]
*  the degree to which you want to put some or all of your treasury or some of all of your cash or [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3844.8s)]
*  some of all of your stocks into Bitcoin is up to you. But I am curious, and I will ask you next [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3849.44s)]
*  year or maybe in the next meetup that we have, how many did that? And then we'll see a year from now [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3858.32s)]
*  or five years from now, how many billions of dollars that was worth to the room. It'll be [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3865.28s)]
*  interesting to experiment. The low risk way to do it, Pete, is you just go to a venture capitalist [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3872.2400000000002s)]
*  and next time you raise $50 million in capital, raise $100 million in capital, and then put $50 [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3877.68s)]
*  million into Bitcoin and the other $50 million or whatever. I mean, how many people in the room have [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3883.52s)]
*  a business they think they can grow 20% a year every year for the next decade without taking any [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3889.6s)]
*  more capital, without a capital investment, without hiring another person, without taking [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3894.96s)]
*  competitive risk? If you're honest with yourself, no one is sure they can do that. There's like seven [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3901.04s)]
*  companies that have done it, Google, Facebook, Amazon. We know their names because for every one [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3908.08s)]
*  of them succeeded, 10,000 companies failed. It is statistically very difficult. But on the other [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3915.2799999999997s)]
*  hand, so when you invest in Bitcoin, it's probably the least risky thing you're doing. But I'm not [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3923.6s)]
*  telling you, by the way, the big idea is not just take every last penny and buy Bitcoin. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3928.96s)]
*  The real big idea is that their venture capitalists like SoftBank with $10 billion, $20 billion, $50 [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3934.16s)]
*  billion, their problem is they need to invest the money. They need to invest the money. They need a [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3940.7200000000003s)]
*  use of proceeds. And Bitcoin is the world's greatest use of proceeds because it's accretive, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3948.8s)]
*  it beats the cost of capital. Sovereign debt does not beat the cost of capital. Cash does not beat [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3956.16s)]
*  the cost of capital. By the way, you can't do this with art. You can't do it with real estate. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3965.2s)]
*  The closest thing would be I'm going to raise billions of dollars, I'm going to buy high quality [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3971.44s)]
*  real estate. And so that's a real estate development thing. But that's a 20th century idea. And we're [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3976.7999999999997s)]
*  in the 21st century and you need to think about cyber real estate. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3983.36s)]
*  Let me go to about 20 minutes of questions here. If you have a question, please go to this [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3988.2400000000002s)]
*  microphone. One of the microphones here. Michael, while people are lining up here, what about AI [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3992.56s)]
*  and Bitcoin? Okay, I think the way that AI is empowered by Bitcoin is literally Bitcoin is [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=3998.08s)]
*  digital money and AI is digital intelligence. You think about the idea like I create a digital [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4006.8s)]
*  accountant that gives advice or a digital lawyer that gives advice. Well, how does it get paid? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4014.4s)]
*  What if I wanted to actually release that digital thing and have it learn to do this in every [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4019.76s)]
*  country? But how do I cross borders? How does the AI get credit cards? It can't. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4024.6400000000003s)]
*  We talked about having a appropriate jurisdiction where AI can self-incorporate, start their company [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4032.9599999999996s)]
*  and run it. Charlie, let's kick it off with you, pal. Wow. Thank you. So I have a question about [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4039.6s)]
*  governments getting into digital currency. What's your opinion about governments getting into [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4048.72s)]
*  digital currency as a way of directing how people will spend money? So the example being [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4055.6s)]
*  government issues of digital currency says if you make less than $250,000 and you do X, Y, and Z, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4064.96s)]
*  we'll give you A, B, and C. But if you make over a certain amount, you get the point of what I'm [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4073.12s)]
*  talking about. Yeah, so just to be clear, so I am, I don't think Bitcoin's digital currency, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4077.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it's digital property. But an example of digital currency is Tether or USD or Euros or CNY [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4083.76s)]
*  moving on a digital device. Governments, as long as there's an effective government and they have [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4090.8s)]
*  power, they're going to designate legal tender. And currency is a system of control as well as a [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4097.92s)]
*  medium of exchange. And so it's going to be a very political issue, very controversial. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4105.12s)]
*  There'll be lots of politics. In an authoritarian government, they will use a digital currency as [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4110.96s)]
*  a system of control. In the US, there's a massive fight on Capitol Hill over whether or not there [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4116.32s)]
*  should be a digital currency. And people that believe in freedom and the like, they're going [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4121.92s)]
*  to fight it and do their best to stop it. I think that you'll see that debate in every country in [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4128.08s)]
*  the world, it'll continue. And it'll be layered in with another debate, which is, for example, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4135.12s)]
*  if the people that love the digital dollar in the form of Tether are actually the Argentines that [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4142.5599999999995s)]
*  want a medium of exchange. So the positive of a digital currency for the United States is, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4150.5599999999995s)]
*  if the US actually mandated a digital currency, the dollar would collapse and replace every other [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4157.84s)]
*  currency in the world, including it would metastasize through Russia, through China, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4163.6s)]
*  through all of our enemies and our friends. And you would have allies of America complaining [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4169.52s)]
*  that their local currency collapsed. And you would have enemies of America not liking that. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4174.88s)]
*  So it can be used as a tool to spread, to make a certain currency, a reserve currency. And if you [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4180.64s)]
*  want the US dollar to remain the world's reserve currency, you would actually argue in favor of a [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4189.6s)]
*  digital currency, because why wouldn't you want China to run on the dollar if you could get it to [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4194.72s)]
*  work that way? But equally, there's the issue of who controls it. Are you going to have a private [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4200.96s)]
*  corporation issue it running on a crypto rail, or are you going to have a government issue it running [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4206.56s)]
*  on a state controlled banking rail? Look, I don't have the answer. It's very controversial. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4211.12s)]
*  I do think that the future of digital currencies in the US will probably be influenced heavily by [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4217.52s)]
*  the November elections and by the next administration. Thank you. Adam? Michael, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4223.200000000001s)]
*  I'm curious how you think about the identity of Satoshi. Does it matter a lot to you? Have [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4228.240000000001s)]
*  you spent a lot of resources trying to investigate this? No, I don't think it matters at all. And I [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4234.320000000001s)]
*  think it's better that we never know. And I think that what makes Bitcoin special is it had an [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4238.240000000001s)]
*  immaculate conception. Look, there's a fundamental, a very asset test. Is it a commodity or is it a [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4245.28s)]
*  security? If a crypto asset is a commodity, that means it's an asset without an issuer. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4252.08s)]
*  If it's going to be a commodity, it means no person, no company, no government, no group of [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4257.92s)]
*  people can exercise undue influence over the future of the protocol. If there was a Satoshi alive [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4264.24s)]
*  speaking, tweeting today and Satoshi said, I think we should change this part of the protocol, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4272.16s)]
*  that would be an awful, awful fact. It would undermine the integrity of the network. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4278.48s)]
*  There's the guy that invented gold is not tweeting that he wants to change the atomic [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4284.639999999999s)]
*  characteristics of gold and the density of gold. That's why it's actually a commodity. And so [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4290.719999999999s)]
*  it's, I think Bitcoin is unique and that it had an immaculate conception. Satoshi's gone, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4297.92s)]
*  walked away and the thing didn't even monetize until pizza day 18 months later. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4305.44s)]
*  And I think that it can't be ethical. It can't, it can't be ethical money and global money, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4312.5599999999995s)]
*  unless it's a commodity. It's easy to create a security. You can create a million securities. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4319.84s)]
*  You could spend them up in three hours. It's hard to create a commodity because the, the, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4325.28s)]
*  the miracle of Bitcoin was we released something to the hobbyist that's worthless. And then on [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4330.8s)]
*  pizza day, a year and a half later, someone wants to pay a fraction of a penny for it. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4337.92s)]
*  And it spontaneously monetizes. That's never happened in the history of the world. It may [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4344.32s)]
*  never happen again. And Satoshi is, it's not necessary. It's not relevant and it's an open [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4349.76s)]
*  source protocol. Read the code, right? And, and decide for yourself whether you trust it. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4356.88s)]
*  Thomas. Yeah. I totally liked the idea to swap your treasury into Bitcoin. And I want to discuss [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4364.56s)]
*  another idea with you because all the people who hold Bitcoin today, and we are huddling as a [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4371.76s)]
*  thing that we are doing for, for many years, and we have locked so far more than a trillion [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4377.84s)]
*  of dollars in assets into Bitcoin, which is in a way, capital, which is idling, you know? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4384.0s)]
*  So that's why I want to hear your opinion about defying on Bitcoin, which would be, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4390.8s)]
*  enable that you can borrow against your Bitcoin and then reinvest it in assets like decentralized [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4399.52s)]
*  infrastructure. I think we've got an open market and there are thousands of experiments and [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4405.2s)]
*  thousands of projects going on right now. Well, for example, MicroStrategy has more than 200,000 [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4410.72s)]
*  Bitcoin. I just borrowed 1.4 billion last week. That's DeFi, right? And so how do we do that? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4416.8s)]
*  We did that working with options market, convertible debt market, the NASDAQ spot market. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4424.88s)]
*  IBIT, you know, is a BlackRock application. Sometime in the next year to two years, I'm sure that [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4430.96s)]
*  major wirehouses like JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs will give you loans against that. That's a [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4439.12s)]
*  different way to do it. There's a bunch of crypto approaches, right? At the end of the day, the issue [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4444.16s)]
*  of, you know, do you want to be able to get yield on your, you can get yield. The people that bought [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4451.2s)]
*  my convertible debt, they're getting yield, right? And so there's a lot of ways to get yield. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4458.24s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to generate credit. They all come with counterparty risk and the question is, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4464.639999999999s)]
*  which counterparty do you want to trust? And, you know, sometimes we trust something like FTX or [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4471.5199999999995s)]
*  Genesis and they let you down. Other, you know, some people don't trust the CME or NASDAQ. Some [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4478.16s)]
*  people don't trust whatever. I would never endorse anything. What I would say is that [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4483.6s)]
*  there's a hundred thousand experiments that will run. They're going to be, the answer is going to [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4488.8s)]
*  be different in Singapore than it is in China, than it is in the US, than it is in France. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4493.04s)]
*  And it's going to be different five years from now than it is right now. So all these are morphing. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4498.4800000000005s)]
*  But I do think that Bitcoin at the end of the day is the highest quality capital. It is going to, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4504.0s)]
*  it is, you know, is the most credit worthy thing because you've got [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4510.48s)]
*  transparency to a 24-7-365. We have a situation where the credit markets and the payment markets [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4514.88s)]
*  are immature. There's a huge amount of work to be done over the next decade to build out all of these [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4522.72s)]
*  various parts of the financial universe. And like some people will do it very enthusiastically, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4529.2s)]
*  like Sam Bankman Fried was very enthusiastic, didn't know what he didn't know and blew up. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4534.96s)]
*  Other people will go slower, but they'll do a better job. And the answer will be different [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4541.68s)]
*  for every type of entity. So I am enthusiastic, but I don't think there's any one answer. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4550.72s)]
*  I think it's a market economy. Warren. Hi. I love what you're doing in your stock. In fact, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4556.16s)]
*  I've made five times more on your stock and derivatives around it than buying Bitcoin. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4563.68s)]
*  So one of my questions would be, why should we buy Bitcoin? Why don't we just buy your stock? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4569.4400000000005s)]
*  And what do you think the halving event is really going to do to the price? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4574.96s)]
*  Bitcoin is a commodity. It's an asset without an issuer. Whenever you invest in a company, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4579.6s)]
*  you're taking counterparty risk. In order to invest in my stock, you should reasonably read [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4585.68s)]
*  1,000 pages of disclosures. And I'll make the obvious point, people in Nigeria can't [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4590.72s)]
*  self-custody MicroStrategy stock. So what we're trying to solve the problem of creating integrity, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4599.280000000001s)]
*  sovereignty, truth and hope for the world, that's going to be done by a protocol. MicroStrategy is [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4606.8s)]
*  simply a high-performance business. There's a lot of other businesses and every business does their [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4616.88s)]
*  thing in the world as best they can. So we offer a very particular thing to us. We offer convertible [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4624.72s)]
*  debt to convertible arbitrageurs, and they have billions of dollars of capital and they can only [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4633.12s)]
*  convertible arbitrage. So if we didn't give it to them, their capital wouldn't come in the ecosystem. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4638.8s)]
*  And so that $1.4 billion that I got came from them that went into Bitcoin. I need to do something [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4644.24s)]
*  for them. It's a complicated something. There's a lot of volatility to it. There's a limit to how [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4651.4400000000005s)]
*  much we can do. You know, the truth is I would recommend anybody that's interested in Bitcoin, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4658.56s)]
*  they should study Bitcoin before they buy anything. And then after they study Bitcoin for $100, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4666.88s)]
*  they ought to, I would say you ought to buy the Bitcoin. The real debate ought to be, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4671.44s)]
*  do you buy the Bitcoin in self-custody, buy the Bitcoin in institutional custody, buy the Bitcoin [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4677.599999999999s)]
*  through an ETF? Because Bitcoin is the innovation, right? Bitcoin is the innovation. If you're a [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4682.4s)]
*  professional investor and you have billions of dollars of capital, by the way, the investors [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4691.28s)]
*  of my company aren't allowed to buy Bitcoin, nor are they allowed to buy the ETF. Their charter is [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4696.16s)]
*  here's $10 billion. You have to invest in publicly traded operating companies. So my company is [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4702.0s)]
*  meeting a need for certain types of investors that are sophisticated. I'm not here to promote [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4709.44s)]
*  my company, right? I expect Bitcoin will be here a thousand years from now. My company won't be, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4714.639999999999s)]
*  I won't be, right? There's not much to be said there. What about the having? What do you expect [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4722.4s)]
*  to see? Bitcoins, right now there are 900 Bitcoin naturally produced every day available for sale [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4729.36s)]
*  and the miners generally have to sell them. They have high electricity bills and high debt bills [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4736.5599999999995s)]
*  and build outs. Around April 20th, that'll be cut in half. That's 23 million a day or 20 something [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4741.839999999999s)]
*  million a day. That's like taking $8 billion a year of supply out of the market. It will be the [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4750.32s)]
*  most consequential having in the history of Bitcoin in my opinion. It will create a squeeze. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4756.24s)]
*  It means at that point, if the natural organic demand is an excess of, you know, 25 million a [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4763.28s)]
*  day, then there is no natural seller. So it's obviously, it's very bullish for the asset class [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4770.48s)]
*  and for Bitcoin holders. I think that by 2028, you'll be down to 225 Bitcoin a day. It'll start [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4779.36s)]
*  to become second order and by 2032, it's a rounding error in the noise. Who are the sellers of Bitcoin [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4787.28s)]
*  over the last six months in a year? I think that there's a number of classes of sellers. The [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4794.96s)]
*  bankruptcy of states like FTX bankruptcy, Genesis bankruptcy, a lot of these people have billion [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4801.5199999999995s)]
*  dollar positions of Bitcoin and other crypto assets and they're not long term investors. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4807.92s)]
*  They're just looking to unwind and get their creditors whole or unwind the trust. So they're [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4813.4400000000005s)]
*  the big natural sellers right now. So they were flushed out of the system? And they're getting [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4819.36s)]
*  flushed out of the system. And then I think the miners are the persistent natural sellers. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4824.16s)]
*  Otherwise, the volatility in the system, it comes, there's a, the primary volatility is that Bitcoin [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4831.04s)]
*  is cross collateralized and cross traded with the other crypto assets. It's an unregulated market [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4841.28s)]
*  traded offshore 24-7-365. There are many, many billions of dollars of Bitcoin held offshore. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4849.36s)]
*  There's $400 billion of ETH in the market cap. There's 80 billion and 80 billion of Solana and [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4857.04s)]
*  BNB right now. If you had a billion dollars of crypto tokens offshore, you could post it as [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4863.36s)]
*  collateral and you could do a $10 billion trade in an hour on Saturday night, unregulated, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4869.2s)]
*  unreported. So the wild west, the number one source of volatility in my opinion is unregulated offshore [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4876.48s)]
*  after hours crypto trading. The second, the lesser source of volatility is the options and the futures [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4884.64s)]
*  and derivatives market onshore during normal trading hours in the western world. But I think that [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4892.320000000001s)]
*  although they are capable of face ripping trades, you know, the degenerates and the crypto ecosystem [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4898.320000000001s)]
*  put them all to shame in terms of what people will do. Face ripping trades. Over the years, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4906.08s)]
*  I've experimented with many intermittent fasting programs. The truth is I've given up on intermittent [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4912.0s)]
*  fasting as I've seen no real benefit when it comes to longevity. But this changed when I discovered [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4918.4s)]
*  something called Prolon's 5-day fasting nutrition program. It harnesses the process of autophagy. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4924.08s)]
*  This is a cellular recycling process that revitalizes your body at a molecular level. And just one cycle [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4930.88s)]
*  of the 5-day Prolon fasting nutrition program can support healthy aging, fat-focused weight loss, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4937.68s)]
*  improved energy levels and more. It's a painless process and I've been doing it twice a year for [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4944.0s)]

*  I appreciate everything you're saying. I just want to know what's your thoughts on Ethereum or [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4978.16s)]
*  Litecoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies out there? I stay in my lane generally and I say [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4984.24s)]
*  you should buy Bitcoin. Don't sell your Bitcoin. Bitcoin's good. I like Bitcoin. It's an ethical [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4992.96s)]
*  commodity. Everything else in the crypto. What I'll say about everything else is the rest of [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=4998.32s)]
*  digital asset ecosystem is a bunch of good ideas with a lot of regulatory uncertainty and competitive [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5006.24s)]
*  uncertainty and technical uncertainty. So they're all interesting ideas. Digital currency is [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5013.92s)]
*  interesting. It's very controversial. Digital tokens are interesting. They're very controversial. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5020.8s)]
*  Digital securities are interesting. Very controversial. Digital exchanges are interesting. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5026.72s)]
*  They're very controversial. I have no recommendations one way or the other. I just think they're [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5031.68s)]
*  complicated. Hi Michael. So I'm bullish on Bitcoin. So I'm a big supporter. But is there a [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5038.72s)]
*  situation or an event that you view that could potentially lead to the collapse of Bitcoin? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5047.4400000000005s)]
*  Have you guys thought about what that event may be? Putting it differently, I was going to ask that [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5054.4800000000005s)]
*  question. If it's 10 years from now and Bitcoin has failed, what caused it to fail? You know, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5057.52s)]
*  when I started searching around and I discovered Bitcoin, I thought, okay, well, this is crypto [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5066.0s)]
*  gold, but it's got none of the defects of gold. It's got all the attributes of a big tech monopoly. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5071.36s)]
*  It's better money than any economist has ever conceptualized in the history of the world. So I [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5078.72s)]
*  thought, this is kind of perfect money. I can't see it being more perfect. So the question is, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5084.4s)]
*  is it going to be banned? Is it going to be copied or is it going to be hacked? You know, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5090.08s)]
*  you start as the denier. It's not a good thing. And then you go to skeptics. Skeptic is it's too [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5095.2s)]
*  good to be true. So when I got to my skeptical phase, I just asked, will it be banned? Will it [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5101.12s)]
*  be copied? Will it be hacked? And I stared at it. And the conclusion was, it's only if it's [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5106.88s)]
*  understood to be property, not currency, then no, it's not going to be banned in a country that [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5114.16s)]
*  gives you property rights, which means it's banned in Cuba. It's banned in North Korea. If the world [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5119.92s)]
*  becomes communist and they deprive you of the ability to own things, that's an existential risk, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5125.28s)]
*  but that's not a problem in Russia or China or the U S right now. So not banned. Will it be copied? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5130.48s)]
*  It was copied 10,000 times. They all failed. This is, this is the winner of that 10,000 experiments. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5138.08s)]
*  So not so yeah, it, it worked and now will it be hacked? And Satoshi's got 50, 60 billion dollars [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5144.48s)]
*  in a wallet out there. Then that's the reward for hacking it. And no one's figured out how to get [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5153.76s)]
*  the money yet. So it hasn't been hacked. And I know, I know it's, it's able to store 60 billion [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5158.0s)]
*  without anybody hitting it. So what I think is I think the way to understand Bitcoin is, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5164.64s)]
*  is everything you learned in economics and about money and your entire life was pseudo science, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5172.400000000001s)]
*  you know, and superstitious and, and you can't blame the economist for being mired in pseudo [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5179.280000000001s)]
*  science and superstition because we never had, we never discovered perfect money. And so Bitcoin [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5187.76s)]
*  is the first time that we actually discovered a thermodynamically sound, mathematically sound [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5197.04s)]
*  economic protocol in the history of the world. So I think we will date things before Satoshi and [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5203.360000000001s)]
*  after Satoshi. And I think that you can't think of it as a network or as a product. You have to [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5210.32s)]
*  look at it as a protocol the human race discovered like base 10 math, massive protocol, like the [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5218.16s)]
*  metric systems of protocol, like English as a protocol. And, and so this is the first sound [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5224.88s)]
*  protocol, economic protocol in the history of the world. Now we finally realize why seashells and [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5233.04s)]
*  bales of tobacco and fiat currency and gold coins and silver coins and copper tokens and glass beads [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5239.44s)]
*  and the giant stone coin of the YAP people. We feel we understand why that stuff never worked. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5245.839999999999s)]
*  Now, you know, if you really understand Bitcoin is because I've got an asset where the energy [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5251.679999999999s)]
*  has a half life of forever and the half life of energy and gold is 30 years and the half life of [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5256.799999999999s)]
*  your money or your energy and the dollar is 10 years and the half life of your energy and the [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5264.4s)]
*  boulevard is one year. And now once you understand that basic breakthrough, now the light bulb goes [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5269.599999999999s)]
*  off. So I think all the smart money, all the, all the smart people in the world that don't trust the [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5278.16s)]
*  bank, don't trust the currency, want to keep their money, they're all discovering Bitcoin. It's like [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5285.839999999999s)]
*  all the smart people decided to use math and use this language and now what happens in the future? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5291.52s)]
*  Well, stuff will advance, but you're going to have a trillion and a 10 trillion and a hundred [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5300.8s)]
*  trillion dollar network. And if someone comes up with a new crypto algorithm and it's better, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5306.080000000001s)]
*  we're just going to fold it into this network. And if someone comes up with, with another twist or [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5311.68s)]
*  tweak, we're going to fold it in the network. You're not going to, it's like saying everybody [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5317.44s)]
*  uses English in the world of science and trade today, but English doesn't have a word for my [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5323.599999999999s)]
*  widget. So I think we should all switch to Swahili because they've got the word. And my answer is, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5328.799999999999s)]
*  I think we're just going to put the word into English and we're going to stick with English. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5334.639999999999s)]
*  So Bitcoin is a protocol. It's going to go on a long, long, long time. And I think that as long as [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5339.2s)]
*  the world doesn't plunge into some Orwellian, no property rights situation, I think we're good. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5347.04s)]
*  I'm going to take three last questions from Paul, from Mark and from Marina on zoom. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5354.72s)]
*  Paul. Hi, Michael. Paul from Chicago, Illinois. Very essential talk. You've convinced me to [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5360.72s)]
*  get crypto, but not just reason. He's not pitching crypto. I mean, Bitcoin, Bitcoin. So that's, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5368.56s)]
*  that's, um, to be more specific, how do you think about these other, other stable coins like [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5375.68s)]
*  Cardano and Ethereum and is crypto in general, a zero sum game or not a zero sum game? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5385.04s)]
*  Cardano and Ethereum aren't stable coins. They're, they're crypto tokens, you know, which are probably [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5392.08s)]
*  unregistered securities. And so Cardano has been designated as an unregistered security by the SEC [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5399.68s)]
*  explicitly in lawsuits. Ethereum is this massive gray zone. So, uh, at the end of the day, Bitcoin [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5406.0s)]
*  is the only, the only thing in the world universally acknowledged by every rational, intelligent [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5413.76s)]
*  person is Bitcoin is a commodity. Everything else you're going to see people disagree on and [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5419.280000000001s)]
*  fight over and litigate politically. And there's a war that will go on. And so what I think is [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5426.64s)]
*  there's 10,000 things that people are going to fight over. There's one thing that is institutional [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5433.200000000001s)]
*  adoption. It's clear. So it's like asking me which of the 10,000 mobile apps would I suggest [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5441.04s)]
*  I should invest in? My answer is none of them because there's a 99% failure rate in startups. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5448.0s)]
*  So I'm not going to, I'm not going to recommend you invest in a company. Which of 10,000 buildings [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5454.72s)]
*  should you buy? I don't know. Which of 10,000 pieces of art should you buy? I don't know. I mean, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5459.84s)]
*  that's your business, right? If you want to do that, you do that. The only thing that I'm here to say [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5466.320000000001s)]
*  is Bitcoin is a digital commodity. If you want global money, then it has to be a commodity. It [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5471.280000000001s)]
*  cannot be a security, right? I'm not going to tell you to buy Apple stock. Apple stock will not be a [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5478.400000000001s)]
*  store of value in China in a hundred years, right? I mean, even Tim Cook would tell you that. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5483.28s)]
*  So the world is very complicated when you get into securities and other types of [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5488.96s)]
*  investments. The idea of Bitcoin is what if we had a global money that was based on a crypto [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5495.5199999999995s)]
*  network that's decentralized and ethical? It is zero sum. Ultimately zero sum. No, I think Apple [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5503.5199999999995s)]
*  will be a successful company. Is crypto economy zero sum? If the administration flips and they [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5510.8s)]
*  allow companies to issue stable coins, then a company that issues a stable coin in a compliant [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5522.64s)]
*  regime will make a lot of money issuing it. And if the next head of the SEC says that Tom Brady [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5528.16s)]
*  can issue Tom Brady coin and 10 million tokens and file a quarterly statement saying how many [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5533.92s)]
*  tokens are out there, then there's a business there. So there's a million, as I said, there's [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5540.72s)]
*  a lot of good ideas. If you've got a regulatory regime that will allow you to do it in a legal [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5545.76s)]
*  fashion, then it might be a good business. Right now, again, Bitcoin is, if you're trying to replace [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5553.28s)]
*  global money, if the question is which is the global money, Bitcoin's the global money, it's [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5563.44s)]
*  going to eat everything. If you want to talk about what's going to eat, forget about cryptos, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5568.799999999999s)]
*  there's no money in crypto. Probably the total amount of money invested in all the cryptos since [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5573.919999999999s)]
*  the beginning of time other than Bitcoin probably isn't even $50 billion. My company's invested $7 [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5579.44s)]
*  billion. There's not a single person that's publicly disclosed who invested $100 million [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5587.52s)]
*  in any other crypto project in the last decade I can think of. So I don't think there is any capital [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5596.400000000001s)]
*  there. The capital is in gold, real estate, art, corporations, the S&P index, and corporate bonds. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5601.68s)]
*  And so what's really going to happen next is Bitcoin is demonetizing gold, silver, it's going [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5609.76s)]
*  to demonetize a lot of real estate, it's going to demonetize a whole lot of... Why would you put [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5616.0s)]
*  your money in the S&P index when 493 of the companies are failing? So you talked about [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5622.96s)]
*  demonetization, right? The money, $500 trillion of it is in the 20th century economy, it's not in [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5629.2s)]
*  the crypto economy. That's what's going to be attacked next. Hey Peter, thank you. Michael, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5637.6s)]
*  after doing the amount of research that you've talked about, in 2017 I made a very large bet, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5642.56s)]
*  put all of my investable net worth into Tesla. And then in 2020 when COVID hit, I started doing [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5649.4400000000005s)]
*  what you said not to do, giving it away. And I put a half million dollars to fund the Denver Basic [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5656.88s)]
*  Income Project. And so as we're making this transition into this new economy that we're not [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5662.8s)]
*  all sure what it's going to turn out to be, I'm curious about what you think the role is of [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5667.28s)]
*  universal basic income and Bitcoin as maybe a tool to finance that in the idea of trying to create [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5672.4s)]
*  an economy that works for all and seeing human capital as a type of capital that we might want to [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5679.84s)]
*  invest in more heavily as we think about putting our resources into capital. Well, I mean, the issue [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5687.5199999999995s)]
*  of UBI is above my pay grade, so that's an issue which I'm not going to opine on because I'm not [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5694.64s)]
*  an expert and it's not my area of expertise. With regard to Bitcoin though, I do think that [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5701.04s)]
*  one of the killer apps of Bitcoin is to endow a charity. So using Bitcoin to power the end, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5709.04s)]
*  I'm using Bitcoin to power my nonprofit, which gives away free education. And the promise of [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5716.8s)]
*  Bitcoin is you can do it forever. And so you could power a church, a park, any kind of charitable [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5722.96s)]
*  activity using Bitcoin because the number one problem they have is they need their endowment [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5730.4800000000005s)]
*  to go up over time. And so anybody that's got any amount of capital, if you're investing it, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5736.24s)]
*  you're getting a 20% return instead of a 5% return, you're actually going to be able to [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5742.32s)]
*  perpetuate your mission. Bill Ackman had a proposal of putting $10,000 into the S&P 500 [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5748.4s)]
*  when the child was born and it would be worth so many millions of dollars when they're ready for [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5754.4s)]
*  retirement. But I think it's a much sounder, put $10,000 at the government to put it into Bitcoin [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5759.839999999999s)]
*  and then you don't have any dependencies thereafter. And the money is made available [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5766.879999999999s)]
*  after retirement age. You can't touch it. I gave a pretty famous speech in Madeira where I said [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5771.28s)]
*  Bitcoin is for everybody, everyone. And the point really is- A lot of crowds cheering for you there. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5778.8s)]
*  Yeah, well anybody that flies all the way to Madeira to talk about Bitcoin likes Bitcoin. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5786.08s)]
*  But my point really was you can power a city, a state, a country, a church, a charity, a nonprofit, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5791.44s)]
*  a family, a company. You can power any of those things. And if you've seen my other talks, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5800.96s)]
*  we didn't go into it, but the S&P index is pretty much going up 7% a year for 100 years [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5808.24s)]
*  and the US dollar currency supply is going up 7% a year for 100 years. And it doesn't take a rocket [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5815.44s)]
*  scientist to see that what you have is a basket of assets that are holding their value in real terms [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5822.56s)]
*  while they trend up in nominal terms. And that's not awful. I mean, at least you don't get poor. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5829.76s)]
*  But what you really want is you want something to go up 14% in value a year, why the currency [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5835.92s)]
*  supply goes up 7%. And the way you do that is you strip away all the counterparty risk of a company. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5843.2s)]
*  I mean, you're all in companies, right? If you watch the news, you can see Amazon might get unionized, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5850.24s)]
*  Apple might get fined, Facebook might get sued, right? I mean, Microsoft has their thing. So [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5856.72s)]
*  corporations are tax surfaces for regulation, taxation, tariff. And that's why over 100 years, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5862.8s)]
*  it's likely that you're not going to be able to do any better than simply keep up with inflation [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5872.240000000001s)]
*  under the best of circumstances. And if you want to power a family or a charity, you need to beat it. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5879.2s)]
*  You need to grow faster. And now we're back to my phrase, like doing stuff is highly overrated. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5886.16s)]
*  Apple's on the iPhone 15. If you have to ship the iPhone 99 in the year 2100 in order to not [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5893.04s)]
*  have your stock crash, there's a lot of risk in that. There's a lot of work. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5903.12s)]
*  Marina, we're going to you for the final question on Zoom. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5909.92s)]
*  Thanks. My question is really practical and logistical. So for those of us who have our [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5914.8s)]
*  Bitcoin in self-custody, what are your thoughts around the best way of keeping it safe when we [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5922.96s)]
*  compare something like a cold wallet versus a multi-sig solution like CASA? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5928.48s)]
*  Yeah. I wouldn't feel comfortable giving a particular recommendation on that. I really [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5933.44s)]
*  think that it's a function of who you are, like what stage in your life you are, how technically [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5939.759999999999s)]
*  capable you are, your family situation, your political situation. So I will say this, which is [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5948.96s)]
*  if like if you're a retiree and your hands shake and your eyesight's not good [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5957.4400000000005s)]
*  and you simply would like to not run out of money or live comfortably, you probably ought to buy [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5964.8s)]
*  iBit or buy FBTC or buy some Bitcoin ETF through your broker that you've been dealing with for 40 [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5972.0s)]
*  years because the truth is you're probably not qualified. You probably can't literally type in [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5978.4800000000005s)]
*  the keystrokes necessary to recover or manage that and it would be foolish for you to even go there. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5985.759999999999s)]
*  If you're at a different stage in life, then you might find that the best of all worlds is [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5992.799999999999s)]
*  you buy Bitcoin but you leave with an institutional custodian with the understanding that on one week [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=5999.919999999999s)]
*  notice you can self-custody if and when you need to or when you lose faith in the counterpart [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6006.719999999999s)]
*  of the custodian, right? And there are a lot of people for which that's the appropriate thing. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6014.32s)]
*  And then there's another set of people that they would self-custody because they're capable [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6019.28s)]
*  and it's appropriate and there are a lot of organizations that should. Again, if you're [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6025.12s)]
*  running a company in a certain country where there is no reliable custodian or institutional [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6030.0s)]
*  custodian, it's inappropriate to suggest that the risk of holding Bitcoin at fidelity is the same [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6035.2s)]
*  as the risk of holding Bitcoin at a bank in the middle of a war zone. They're not the same, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6044.96s)]
*  right? And so you've got extreme differences depending on who you are and where you are. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6052.48s)]
*  And I think that, but well, I will say the obvious thing, which is when you decide to go to [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6060.88s)]
*  self-custody, you're taking on a much greater responsibility and you need to be technically [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6065.84s)]
*  much more proficient and capable. So you have to put more time in and be prepared to do that [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6071.599999999999s)]
*  if you're going to do it. Michael, thank you, buddy. Thank you for joining us tonight. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cifuTy4fBfg&t=6079.599999999999s)]
