# AI Leaders Reveal the Next Wave of AI Breakthroughs (At FII Miami 2025) | EP #150
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw)
*  Welcome, welcome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=0.0s)]
*  We're about to have a conversation, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1.84s)]
*  and I want you to listen up. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=3.36s)]
*  This is the technology that's going to reshape [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=5.36s)]
*  your families, your lives, your businesses, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=8.2s)]
*  your industries, your nation states. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=12.0s)]
*  And the question I'm going to be asking at the end here [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=14.8s)]
*  is are you ready? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=16.92s)]
*  So, let's dive in. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=18.68s)]
*  I'm going to be going through two rounds of questions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=22.2s)]
*  I'm embarrassed that we should in fact [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=24.2s)]
*  have a three hour session for our panel, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  but we've got 30 minutes, so you'll excuse me [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=29.52s)]
*  as we run through this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=31.68s)]
*  Prem, I love what your company has done, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=35.2s)]
*  and you're an example of a CEO who takes a company [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=38.2s)]
*  and like, it doesn't 10 exit, you 100 exit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=41.6s)]
*  Stability AI, what are you doing, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  and how are you going to impact the world? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=49.44s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=52.08s)]
*  So, Stability is the creator of Stable Diffusion, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=52.92s)]
*  which launched August 22, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  which changed everything in image based AI generation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=59.04s)]
*  It was the chat GPT moment for image. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=63.8s)]
*  There's been over 270 million downloads [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=67.48s)]
*  of Stable Diffusion to date. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=70.88s)]
*  Give you a sense of scale. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=74.04s)]
*  The number two most popular model [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=76.0s)]
*  has been downloaded nine million times. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=79.12s)]
*  So, it is by far the market leader. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=80.52s)]
*  What we're using it now for is my background [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=83.52s)]
*  is in professional film and television, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=86.68s)]
*  and we're now fine tuning what I call ultra narrow AI, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=88.72s)]
*  fine tuning our model to work [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=93.52s)]
*  in a professional content creation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=96.88s)]
*  So, film, TV, gaming, and marketing, and advertising. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=98.52s)]
*  So, you brought Jim Cameron onto your board. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=101.6s)]
*  You have investors. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=103.92s)]
*  I'm an investor, full disclosure. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  You brought in Eric Schmidt, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=106.2s)]
*  an incredible group of individuals. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=107.6s)]
*  How far are we from creating reality [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=110.88s)]
*  given the technology that exists right now? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=115.0s)]
*  We're already there with certain workflows. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, what we're doing with, to make this a full reality, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=120.72s)]
*  we're doing exactly as the artist creates a film. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=124.64s)]
*  So, what we've seen in other text to video models [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=128.28s)]
*  are one text and one video. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=131.28s)]
*  That's not how professional content's created. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=133.72s)]
*  Professional content is created in shot elements, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=135.88s)]
*  and then they're composited together to make the shot. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=138.32s)]
*  So, what we're doing is going step by step [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=141.36s)]
*  in each one of those processes, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=143.6s)]
*  whether that be rig removal or paint and rotoscope, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=145.6s)]
*  or camera match, plate reconstruction, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  and doing hyper narrow AI models around each and every step. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=150.84s)]
*  We're probably about two dozen models in, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=155.24s)]
*  and about 50 to 60 models. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=158.72s)]
*  How far are we from me starring [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=160.56s)]
*  in my favorite episode, Star Trek? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=163.6s)]
*  You should be in that now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=166.48s)]
*  I know. If it was up to me. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=167.6s)]
*  But in all seriousness, in terms of video generation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=168.92s)]
*  on the fly where I have a request [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=173.8s)]
*  to create something extraordinary that looks real. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  I would say we're probably, that's gonna happen this year. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  I think within six to 12 months. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=183.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  All right, so how does your reality change [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=186.0s)]
*  when you're not sure if you've created it, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  or if someone else has created it? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  What's possible for you in your businesses, in your lives? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=192.52s)]
*  All right, we'll come back to you in a moment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=197.52s)]
*  Alexander, Ramin, excuse me, Ramin. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  Investor in your company, so full disclosures over here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=204.64s)]
*  Liquid AI. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=207.76s)]
*  You came out of the gate, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=209.92s)]
*  zero to two billion dollar valuation in just about two years. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=211.64s)]
*  At the end of the day, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=216.28s)]
*  you're enabling private AI capability [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=217.76s)]
*  with your liquid models. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=221.84s)]
*  So I know a number of companies that are fearful, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  they don't allow their employees to use ChatGPT [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=226.6s)]
*  because they're concerned [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=229.2s)]
*  that OpenAI has accessed all the data. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=230.28s)]
*  So what's possible using liquid AI? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=232.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=235.8s)]
*  So yeah, we are a foundation model company. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=236.64s)]
*  We are building AI system, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=239.48s)]
*  generative AI systems for enterprises, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=241.96s)]
*  and we are providing these systems, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=245.72s)]
*  we are powering these systems by a new technology, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=247.72s)]
*  not the transformer architecture [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=250.68s)]
*  that enabled the new wave of AI. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=252.52s)]
*  We have created something on top of something [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=254.84s)]
*  that we invented at MIT, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=256.96s)]
*  liquid neural networks at Daniela Rous's lab. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=258.88s)]
*  These are warm inspired AI [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=262.0s)]
*  that transferred into something, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=264.64s)]
*  we evolved these kind of systems [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=266.84s)]
*  into something that is more tangible [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=268.12s)]
*  and now we can create value off of this new type of AI. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=270.76s)]
*  The very special thing about this technology [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  is that the amount of compute that is needed [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=276.64s)]
*  for packing a lot of intelligence into a device [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=279.2s)]
*  is very, very minimal. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=283.08s)]
*  So as opposed to other type of AI, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=284.35999999999996s)]
*  you can get ChatGPT experience on a phone, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=286.44s)]
*  locally on a phone, on a laptop. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=289.44s)]
*  And in places where privacy matters. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=291.4s)]
*  From a product perspective, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  what we did today with enterprises, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=298.2s)]
*  wherever there is sensitivity on data or security issues [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  that you cannot actually use a cloud kind of solution, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  or you don't have access to GPU-based infrastructures, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=308.2s)]
*  this is the places where liquid can immediately come in [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=311.56s)]
*  and expand at large, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=314.32s)]
*  like putting our type of, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  enabling enterprises to use generative AI. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=318.72s)]
*  I mean, you just raised a killer round with G42 [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=321.8s)]
*  as one of the leads, a quarter of a billion dollars. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=324.88000000000005s)]
*  Congratulations on that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=327.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=328.12s)]
*  You're tracking on revenues this year, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=329.12s)]
*  which are spiking, which is fantastic. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=331.04s)]
*  I remember you used your liquid neural networks [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=333.56s)]
*  to fly fighter jets. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  Can you take one second about that? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=340.16s)]
*  this was one of the only neural network architectures [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  that enabled safe applications of AI on device. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=343.68s)]
*  So they trusted, United States Air Force trusted [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=348.0s)]
*  our technology to be the first version of a neural network [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=350.52s)]
*  that can navigate autonomously a flyer jet. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=354.04s)]
*  And you can imagine, like private AI [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=357.2s)]
*  is not just having a chat GBT experience on the phone, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=359.56s)]
*  it can power cars, you know, it can go on a satellite, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=363.12s)]

*  And the applications of these things is phenomenal. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=371.0s)]
*  Like recently I talked to some CEOs [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=374.52s)]
*  of an education company that they're providing tablets [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=376.64000000000004s)]

*  First of all, I have to point out, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  Jack is dressed in Miami. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=401.48s)]

*  Does everyone agree? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=423.8s)]
*  Yes? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=424.64s)]

*  And by the way, Miami Business means [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=427.92s)]
*  wearing avocado dress socks. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  We have avocado dress socks. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=431.68s)]
*  There's many others to choose from though. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=433.64s)]
*  I do want to do a commercial for Jack's US book, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=435.24s)]
*  AI or Die. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  It's very subtle, Peter. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  But it is something that every person should read. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  It is literally what you need to understand [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  as a leader about AI, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=446.76s)]
*  and it's written in a very readable fashion. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=448.44s)]
*  So Jack, you are the CEO of Sandbox AQ. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=451.4s)]
*  AI, A is for AI, Q is for quantum. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=456.44s)]
*  You've got incredible chairman of your board, Eric Schmidt. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=459.56s)]
*  You spun out of MIT with- [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=463.4s)]
*  Google. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=465.8s)]
*  I'm at Google here. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=466.64s)]
*  We also were very involved with MIT also. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=468.2s)]
*  Yeah, out of Google with a incredible seed round, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  I think of how many? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=474.88s)]
*  We raised 850 million now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=476.96s)]
*  850 million. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=478.6s)]
*  Wow, amazing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=479.44s)]
*  All right, so what do people need to know [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=480.28s)]
*  about Sandbox AQ and the quantum networks [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=481.92s)]
*  that you're producing, language models? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  Peter, it's a very exciting moment. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=490.08s)]
*  First of all, it's great to see so many friends [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=491.3s)]
*  on the panel here and in the audience. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=492.74s)]
*  And it's a beginning moment. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=495.5s)]
*  This is the incipient moment for AI. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=497.38s)]
*  Everyone's excited, lots of businesses looking at it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=500.02s)]
*  But I think we're past, hopefully, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=502.88s)]
*  the shiny object phase of AI, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  and now it's getting serious. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=506.54s)]
*  Everyone on this panel has very serious offerings [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=507.94s)]
*  that really impact business and impact how Hollywood works, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=511.14s)]
*  how many, many parts of the major sectors of the world work. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=514.66s)]
*  At Sandbox AQ, what we realized is that language models [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=518.84s)]
*  are fundamental. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=522.2399999999999s)]
*  Everyone, it's table stakes, should be using language models [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=523.0799999999999s)]
*  to cut costs. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=525.88s)]
*  If you have customer service, because you're Delta, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=527.0s)]
*  you're Hertz, you're Hilton, any company with thousands [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=529.64s)]
*  of customers must be using large language models [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=532.68s)]
*  to cut those costs and actually deliver [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  better customer service. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=537.52s)]
*  I think we all know customer service can get worse, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=538.9799999999999s)]
*  you know, as it's delivered now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=541.52s)]
*  So it's only gonna get better. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=543.4s)]
*  But we at Sandbox AQ decided, Peter, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=545.04s)]
*  let's actually go for a different part of the economy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=547.64s)]
*  Let's go for the quantitative AI, not the language AI. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=550.98s)]
*  And what do we mean by that? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=554.26s)]
*  If you're Sanofi, if you're a drug company, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=555.9000000000001s)]
*  if you want to create a new medicine for cancer, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=557.9000000000001s)]
*  for Alzheimer's, for dementia, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=561.02s)]
*  each of our families here in this room, unfortunately, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=563.1800000000001s)]
*  will all be impacted at some point in our lives [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=565.84s)]
*  by these diseases. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=568.36s)]
*  Language models can help initially when they scour [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=569.82s)]
*  and look at all the summaries of scientific literature, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=572.9000000000001s)]
*  very, very helpful, to give you some ideas [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=575.5400000000001s)]
*  about what's been done before. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=577.9000000000001s)]
*  But ultimately, Peter, if we're talking about [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=579.82s)]
*  building a molecule, we need an AI [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=581.5200000000001s)]
*  that is not trained on social media and cat pictures, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=584.12s)]
*  but is trained on molecules and atoms. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=587.0400000000001s)]
*  That's fundamental. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=590.2800000000001s)]
*  And that is the AI that Sandbox AQ [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=592.0400000000001s)]
*  is the global pace setter in. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=595.12s)]
*  Very importantly, you're not talking about [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  using quantum computers to run these quantitative networks. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=598.6400000000001s)]
*  You're using, you know, current... [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=603.2800000000001s)]
*  Quantum equations on the GPUs. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=605.12s)]
*  So what kind of quantum equations are you using on the GPUs? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=607.46s)]
*  Right, so this is something that everyone, of course, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=609.94s)]
*  we all know from elementary school, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=612.1400000000001s)]
*  Schrodinger's equation, all the equations [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=613.86s)]
*  that everyone is familiar with, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=615.6600000000001s)]
*  but what we realized, the breakthrough that we had, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=617.7s)]
*  is that GPUs were getting so much better. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=620.58s)]
*  We have a hardware person on the panel [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=622.98s)]
*  representing token, hardware person, thank you, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=625.22s)]
*  on the panel. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=627.98s)]
*  Fundamental to GPUs is the ability to run [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=629.48s)]
*  in parallel matrix algebra. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=632.1600000000001s)]
*  Imagine a spreadsheet like Excel [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=634.0600000000001s)]
*  times another big spreadsheet, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  a million rows by a million columns, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=637.92s)]
*  and a million rows here by a million columns. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=640.56s)]
*  That magnitude of matrix algebra, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=642.52s)]
*  we can actually convert the quantum equations, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=646.76s)]
*  the equations of drugs, of treatments, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=649.4799999999999s)]
*  of new energy, of battery storage, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  all that we can convert to the language of that GPU. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=653.9599999999999s)]
*  And that's the breakthrough that we had. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=656.9399999999999s)]
*  Now, when quantum computers come in scale, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  we just had a great announcement from Microsoft, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=661.0s)]
*  people may have seen that yesterday, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  another announcement from Google just a few weeks ago. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=664.9s)]
*  These announcements you're gonna see [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=667.9s)]
*  come in a great cadence, culminating in a crescendo, Peter, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=669.26s)]
*  in about five to seven years [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=673.1s)]
*  of having great quantum computers. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=675.26s)]
*  We'll add those to the arsenal. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=677.22s)]
*  We'll have GPU, QPU, quantum processing unit, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=679.02s)]
*  in one mesh cloud hybrid. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=682.14s)]
*  But today, Peter, we use the GPUs to get the work done [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=684.5s)]
*  with drug companies, with Aramco. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=687.82s)]
*  Aramco, I see, is the sponsor. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=690.02s)]
*  Our newest announced customer is Aramco in Saudi. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=691.52s)]
*  Why Aramco? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=695.02s)]
*  Because they wanna take the hydrocarbons [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=696.3s)]
*  coming out of the ground [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=698.62s)]
*  and convert them to higher order chemicals [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=701.1s)]
*  using carbon and hydrogen, not low grade fuels, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=704.5s)]
*  but carbon composites, as an example, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=707.54s)]
*  that could be used to make a car lighter, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=709.66s)]
*  that could be used to make a space rocket lighter, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=711.66s)]
*  that could be used to make an airplane lighter [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=713.72s)]
*  for Airbus or Boeing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=715.38s)]
*  This is the kind of transformation that we focus on [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=717.02s)]
*  with LQM's large quantitative models [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=719.46s)]
*  versus the very necessary large language models. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=722.36s)]
*  Amazing, amazing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Jack is a nuclear power plant behind that man. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  All right, Jim Keller, TenStorm, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=731.32s)]
*  you're a hardware manufacturer. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=734.9200000000001s)]
*  You're our sole hardware manufacturer [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=736.48s)]
*  against all of these software geeks. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=738.44s)]
*  Congratulations on your recent round. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=742.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, pretty good, $700 million of a Series D round. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=745.0s)]
*  So you've got a capital to build hardware. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=748.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=750.18s)]
*  I... [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=751.02s)]
*  I'll take that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=751.86s)]
*  So what kind of hardware are you building? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=755.18s)]
*  And when someone says, no, I only do software, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=758.3s)]
*  how important is hardware versus software today? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=761.14s)]
*  Yeah, so GPU's got a real solid head start on building AI [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=763.74s)]
*  because they had parallel computing, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=769.3399999999999s)]
*  but they're still relatively complicated, the program, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=771.5s)]
*  and the way they do like handle tensors and stuff [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=774.6s)]
*  actually wasn't native to GPUs. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=778.5s)]
*  Now GPUs have evolved to add tensor processors. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=780.5s)]
*  TenStorm builds a native tensor processor [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=783.38s)]
*  that's simpler and easier to program. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=786.46s)]
*  Also, we build it so that the tensor processors [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=789.1800000000001s)]
*  natively talk to each other really nicely. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=791.94s)]
*  And then we, last year, we open sourced our software stack [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=794.88s)]
*  and like the, it's really interesting. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=799.08s)]
*  The fundamental math AI is simple. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=801.34s)]
*  A equal B times C plus D. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=803.4s)]
*  Like it couldn't be simpler at some level, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=805.52s)]
*  but the scale of it is amazing. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=807.84s)]
*  When I started building computers 40 years ago, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=810.76s)]
*  we were doing millions of instructions a second. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=814.2s)]
*  Now we're doing trillions of trillions [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=816.28s)]
*  of instructions a second. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=818.76s)]
*  And the scale of that takes like a special collaboration [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=820.48s)]
*  between the hardware and the software. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=823.8s)]
*  So when you, when your machines are up and operating, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=825.08s)]
*  I guess the question is what are they enabling [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=828.36s)]
*  for people in the room here? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=832.04s)]
*  Well, right now there's a really large family of models. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=834.5s)]
*  So our mission is to run all the models [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=838.5s)]
*  with really simple transparent code. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=840.86s)]
*  So big LOM, people say, oh the software is huge, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=843.4599999999999s)]
*  actually it's 600 lines of code. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=846.5799999999999s)]
*  It's not very complicated at the program level, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=848.26s)]
*  but when you go down in the software stack, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=851.06s)]
*  it can really explode. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=852.9s)]
*  And that's where by building a native software stack [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=854.78s)]
*  that is tensor based, it's communication based, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=857.78s)]
*  and it's open source, people can see exactly [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=861.56s)]
*  how that works and how it runs. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=863.9799999999999s)]
*  And I think that's gonna unlock a lot of AI applications [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=865.9s)]
*  that are currently hard to program with GPUs. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=869.38s)]
*  So there's been a lot of debate on open source [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=871.3s)]
*  versus closed source AI models. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=873.7399999999999s)]
*  And we just saw the R1 model being open source. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=877.1999999999999s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of conversation [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=879.7399999999999s)]
*  where the leaders are saying, you know, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=881.8599999999999s)]
*  open source will win. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=883.8s)]
*  I think there's been an extraordinary velocity [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=885.26s)]
*  in open sourcing. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=888.3s)]
*  How important is open source as far as you see? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=889.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I have personal experience working with GPUs [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=893.76s)]
*  where we're trying to solve a hard software problem. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=897.24s)]
*  We couldn't because the math library was encrypted [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=900.08s)]
*  or part of the software stack was proprietary. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=903.26s)]
*  And because we couldn't look all the way down the stack, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=905.84s)]
*  we couldn't figure out the problem and solve it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=908.76s)]
*  Now open source AI is really wild [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=911.36s)]
*  because most of the high end research is published. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=913.52s)]
*  Many of the models are open source. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=916.94s)]
*  Some of the weights, not that much of the infrastructure, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=918.92s)]
*  not that much of the foundation library. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=922.8199999999999s)]
*  So it turns out to be kind of a mixed bag. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  Like one thing we're gonna do [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=927.92s)]
*  is we're gonna open source a whole software stack. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=929.0s)]
*  And it's for our hardware, but I encourage people, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=931.5999999999999s)]
*  if you have your own hardware [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=933.8s)]
*  and you want software stack that works, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=934.86s)]
*  you know, steal our software, it's a beautiful thing. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=936.7199999999999s)]
*  And then I wanna make it so many of the foundation models, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=939.04s)]
*  the environment, the framework, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  to build and train your own models [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=945.02s)]
*  are also open source and available. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=947.0s)]
*  And I think it's really important to democratize [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=949.46s)]
*  the hardware stack and the software stack [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=952.9s)]
*  so it's not just a few very large players [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=954.56s)]
*  that control the AI world. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=957.08s)]
*  So we have a lot of people from around the world here. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=958.36s)]
*  Are the machines that you're building [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=960.84s)]
*  likely to be used in the global south [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=963.04s)]
*  more than in North America? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=966.72s)]
*  No, we're gonna sell to everybody. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=969.48s)]
*  We licensed a small AI configuration [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=971.04s)]
*  to go on a television chip. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=973.16s)]
*  And we're building machines [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=974.76s)]
*  that can train large language models [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=975.84s)]
*  and everything in between. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=977.44s)]
*  And the other part of our business model, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=978.96s)]
*  and again, I think innovation comes [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=980.6600000000001s)]
*  from lots and lots of input. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=983.0400000000001s)]
*  So the software's open. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=984.44s)]
*  It's been our best hiring strategy, by the way. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=985.52s)]
*  It just is great. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=988.2s)]
*  Our programmers look at our software stack. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=989.36s)]
*  They like it, they send a resume, or worse or funnier. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=991.6s)]
*  They don't like it and they send me a resume [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=994.96s)]
*  because they wanna come fix it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=996.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's really great. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=998.2800000000001s)]
*  And then we've licensed our AI [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  and our RISC-V CPU technology to people. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1003.08s)]
*  And they like it and they use it [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1006.16s)]
*  and they send us feedback. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1007.0s)]
*  So we're gonna license our AI technology, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1008.2s)]
*  but also build and sell systems. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1010.32s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1013.2s)]
*  How many folks here have heard of McKinsey? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1014.96s)]
*  Everybody, right? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1016.9200000000001s)]
*  How many folks here have heard of Quantum Black? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1018.34s)]
*  Could you raise your hand? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1020.08s)]
*  You need some publicity, Alexander. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1023.72s)]
*  So Alexander runs Quantum Black, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1026.38s)]
*  which is a 5,000 person software [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1029.24s)]
*  and engineering team inside of McKinsey [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1033.0s)]
*  on their AI-focused area. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1035.6s)]
*  Your story's been incredible. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1039.16s)]
*  Tell us about Quantum Black, please. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1041.52s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1043.6s)]
*  I think there are basically two worlds. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1044.44s)]
*  There is a beautiful and shiny world that is on this stage [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1046.84s)]
*  and we all enjoy the age of AI, enjoy the valuations, right, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1050.2s)]
*  and having great life. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1053.4s)]
*  And I think we have quite a confused audience [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1055.0s)]
*  that kind of hears it, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1057.48s)]
*  but doesn't see any impact in their lives, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1058.56s)]
*  be it a bottom line, but be it also a human being, right? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1061.1599999999999s)]
*  And kind of, so the question is, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1064.32s)]
*  how do you reconcile these two? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  And if you look at the numbers [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1068.04s)]
*  and we take the technology companies aside, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1069.3999999999999s)]
*  the said number in the last five years is 11%, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1071.9199999999998s)]
*  meaning only one out of 10 use cases [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1077.0s)]
*  ever saw the light of production. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1079.8s)]
*  Everything else is kind of entertainment. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1082.0s)]
*  We play with it, but it's irrelevant. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1083.6399999999999s)]
*  Now, while we're inspired by Gen.AI, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1085.8s)]
*  the success rate is maybe 7% at the best. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1088.8s)]
*  So what we're trying to do in Quantum Black [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1092.92s)]
*  is basically bring these two worlds together, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1094.6s)]
*  where we're trying to move from 11% into 100%. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1097.48s)]
*  And what we got today, exactly like you alluded to, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1103.28s)]
*  is 5,000 people working in 50 countries, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1105.68s)]
*  trying to transform nations and company. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1108.84s)]
*  We have five R&D centers that are working [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1112.76s)]
*  on the most precious products for humanity, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1115.8s)]
*  and we roughly 40 free products that we deploy globally. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1119.04s)]
*  And we clearly work with a lot of colleagues [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1122.96s)]
*  to kind of try to bring their innovation [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1124.88s)]
*  into day-to-day of enterprises around the globe. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1127.2s)]
*  And kind of, indeed, McKinsey is known for producing slides [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1130.28s)]
*  and many other funny things, but also to be fair, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1133.08s)]
*  it's reinvented the consulting profession already twice, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1135.92s)]
*  and this is the third attempt, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1139.2s)]
*  and humbled to be here and try to reinvent it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1140.44s)]
*  One of the things I say is that by the end of this decade, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1143.8s)]
*  there are gonna be two kinds of companies, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1148.56s)]
*  those that are fully utilizing AI [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1150.8s)]
*  and those that are out of business. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1152.84s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1156.4s)]
*  I agree with it, but I think the problem [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1158.04s)]
*  is slightly different, that today, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1159.76s)]
*  most of this transformation, and I think everybody here [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1162.04s)]
*  tried to do a digital transformation, right? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1164.8s)]
*  Or at least declared it to their boards and shareholders. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1166.76s)]
*  Now, the success rate is not high, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1169.84s)]
*  because what we're trying to do is to infuse technology [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1171.52s)]
*  into, by definition, broken process, into the old process. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1175.12s)]
*  And what I truly believe we are, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1180.52s)]
*  instead of kind of learning technology, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1182.28s)]
*  as all the colleagues here on the stage, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1183.8799999999999s)]
*  and stepping back and trying to reinvent something [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1185.8799999999999s)]
*  and understand completely different reality [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1189.12s)]
*  that operates on very different cost structure, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1190.92s)]
*  different social rules, we try to force it, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1192.96s)]
*  and therefore it fails. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1195.2s)]
*  So if anything, I truly believe that we are [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  at the end of age of mediocracy. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1199.16s)]
*  Whatever mediocre, whatever standard, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1201.6s)]
*  could be kind of played by machine, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1203.72s)]
*  but actually beginning of the age of creativity, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1205.56s)]
*  because the notion of how do you create something [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1207.84s)]
*  with technology that is a commodity [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1210.2s)]
*  becomes much more interesting. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1211.72s)]
*  Fram, back to you. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1215.08s)]
*  Most important thing that the audience here [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1216.96s)]
*  needs to take away from the work Stability is doing, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1220.44s)]
*  from your perspective on AI as a enterprise, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1224.28s)]
*  creativity tool, speak to us about that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1229.68s)]
*  Sure, so probably everybody's seen so much controversy [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1233.6399999999999s)]
*  around AI in the entertainment industry, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1238.3999999999999s)]
*  and even the industry went on strike for over a year, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1240.68s)]
*  and then they've settled, and all the guilds [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1244.56s)]
*  have cut deals with the studios. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1246.8799999999999s)]
*  And this is really no different [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1249.08s)]
*  than what really happened in 1927 [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1251.96s)]
*  when movies went from silent to talkies, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1254.3999999999999s)]
*  what they called before. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1258.92s)]
*  There was great controversy at that point. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1259.8000000000002s)]
*  They thought everybody in the Broadway, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1262.28s)]
*  they thought talking was for Broadway, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1264.44s)]
*  and movies needed to be silent, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1266.1200000000001s)]
*  and obviously that was proven wrong. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1267.52s)]
*  Color took forever. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1269.5600000000002s)]
*  Color took decades to actually catch on, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1270.64s)]
*  and then finally in the 60s it did, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1273.0s)]
*  and now it's unthinkable. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1275.0s)]
*  You know, it's like an artistic choice, obviously, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1276.2s)]
*  to be in black and white, and then of course, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1278.8000000000002s)]
*  in digital transformation, everybody kind of fought it [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1281.3200000000002s)]
*  at first, and they're confusing headwind with tailwind. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1283.96s)]
*  I think it's probably the best way I can summarize it. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1287.92s)]
*  And of course, when digital kicked off in 2000 [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1291.16s)]
*  instead of film, by 2017, I think 98% of all films [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1294.24s)]
*  were made on digital. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1298.72s)]
*  So the last thing, statement for the film industry [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1300.3200000000002s)]
*  is don't look at AI as headwind, look at it as tailwind. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1303.16s)]
*  And do we see stability becoming a creative agent [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1307.0400000000002s)]
*  so that every individual can become a creator? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1309.8000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1314.16s)]
*  And we're gonna see it in Avatar 3, 4, and 5? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1315.52s)]
*  Well, Avatar 3, Jim's editing now, so I think he hasn't done, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1319.36s)]
*  but the, and hopefully it'll come out in December, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1322.72s)]
*  but definitely, I think, in the later Avatars and others, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1325.92s)]
*  I think you're gonna hopefully see [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1330.36s)]
*  a lot of our tools in there. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1331.6s)]
*  All right, well, congratulations on the success. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1332.52s)]
*  Prem came in as a CEO, how long ago? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1336.2s)]
*  About eight months ago. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1338.8s)]
*  Eight months ago, and it just revolutionized the company, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1340.16s)]
*  had a huge legacy of models and capabilities, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1342.88s)]
*  but it really driven it in an extraordinary way. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1345.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1347.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1348.72s)]
*  Prem in, the world needs another LLM? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1349.5600000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1356.5600000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1357.64s)]
*  So what the world needs is, as I mean detailed out [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1358.7600000000002s)]
*  very nicely, it's the phase right now [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1362.88s)]
*  that we have to make AI useful. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1365.3200000000002s)]
*  It doesn't matter what runs AI, I mean, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1367.2s)]
*  and then we are in this amazing period of time [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1369.5200000000002s)]
*  where at every scale AI can bring value, you know? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1373.0s)]
*  And you put it nicely, like I can see a future [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1375.88s)]
*  where everything is going to be integrated in our society. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1379.72s)]
*  It's not that we need a different type of LLM, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1384.24s)]
*  we need to do it right, you know? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1386.88s)]
*  We have a motto in our offices that, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1388.48s)]
*  you know, like every engineer at Liquid AI, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1390.64s)]
*  we are designing AI, we call it ML done right, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1392.8s)]
*  machine learning done right. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1396.88s)]
*  So that means we don't need to consume a lot of energy [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1398.56s)]
*  to build AI systems, we don't need to use a lot of energy [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1402.0s)]
*  to host AI systems. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1405.48s)]
*  So what we do, we are basically democratizing [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1406.8s)]
*  kind of access to AI. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1409.4s)]
*  So if you think about it in the cheapest possible way, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1410.4s)]
*  so hosting a foundation model on a phone or on a device, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1414.3600000000001s)]
*  today with Liquid AI costs zero dollars [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1419.8s)]
*  because it doesn't run on a GPU anymore. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1422.28s)]
*  Is everything, is everything is on a device? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1425.4s)]
*  Is every device in my home, in my car, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1427.88s)]
*  in my office going to be AI enabled? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1430.04s)]
*  Correct, yes. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1432.16s)]
*  So what's your world look like when everything is intelligent? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1433.52s)]
*  Every single device you're touching, talking to, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1436.4s)]
*  thinking about is intelligent. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1438.92s)]
*  I think it's going to be amazing. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1441.6s)]
*  And the human humanoid robots that runs in our homes [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1442.76s)]
*  in the future, they're not going to have, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1446.0s)]
*  they're not going to be connected to the cloud, you know? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1448.04s)]
*  They're going to have their own kind of local AI banks [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1449.68s)]
*  when they have like privacy issues. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1452.84s)]
*  That'll make it safe so Elon can't actually, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1453.68s)]
*  you know, sort of start the robot revolution. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1455.28s)]
*  Jack, you see the future and you're leading it [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1458.52s)]
*  and it's just, it's 100Xing, it's not 10Xing. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1464.36s)]
*  As we start to see, you know, QLMs [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1468.8799999999999s)]
*  and as we see quantum computers coming online, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1470.92s)]
*  is the world ready for how much is going to change [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1476.36s)]
*  in the next five years? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1480.56s)]
*  I think it's going to be a fascinating next five years. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1483.84s)]
*  But Peter, if I can just give maybe two ideas [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1486.76s)]
*  that can help the audience to help absorb [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1489.44s)]
*  what's about to happen. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1491.52s)]
*  First is the power of small teams. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1492.96s)]
*  What I recommend to every one of us [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1495.8s)]
*  and what we're practicing is that armed with LLMs [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1497.76s)]
*  and LQMs, armed with these new AI tools [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1501.28s)]
*  that are from the panelists or from others [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1503.64s)]
*  at this conference and elsewhere, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1505.8799999999999s)]
*  small teams can change the world. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1507.84s)]
*  Small teams. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1510.8799999999999s)]
*  If you're a big company, portion off a team of 10 people [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1512.12s)]
*  and say you're going to be in this new area, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1515.32s)]
*  you have this mission, go. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1517.72s)]
*  So you're moonshot teams. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1519.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and so at Sandbox, thank you [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1520.3999999999999s)]
*  just to give you one practical example. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1521.6799999999998s)]
*  There's a big issue when you try to fly a plane now, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1523.4399999999998s)]
*  there's no more GPS. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1525.6399999999999s)]
*  If you try to go to parts of Europe, no more GPS. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  If you go to anywhere in the Gulf region, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1528.8799999999999s)]
*  Saudi, you're landing in Riyadh or Daman, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1531.08s)]
*  if you're landing in Abu Dhabi or Dubai, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1533.2s)]
*  there is no more GPS. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1535.2s)]
*  It's being jammed, it's being spoofed, it's out. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1536.52s)]
*  In the Indo-Paycom area, in the Pacific, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1539.08s)]
*  again, PRC China is blocking GPS there. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1541.28s)]
*  An 11 person team, Peter, that we arm with this kind of AI [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1544.6s)]
*  and some quantum sensors, solve the problem. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1548.24s)]
*  It's flying now on the United States Air Force. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1550.4399999999998s)]
*  And so small teams now are the order of the day. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1553.08s)]
*  As managers, as leaders, this is what we're doing, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1557.6799999999998s)]
*  this is what I think more people will start to realize. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1560.52s)]
*  And the second thing I would leave you with, Peter, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1562.84s)]
*  is that I know a lot of people are still concerned about AI, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1564.84s)]
*  concerned about what are the implications of AI. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1568.12s)]
*  Let me also say that what we're concerned about [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1571.24s)]
*  is people not embracing AI fast enough [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1573.92s)]
*  to solve the big problems of our current society. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1576.44s)]
*  Let's hit the big diseases that have plagued us [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1579.72s)]
*  and challenged us for 40 plus years. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1583.24s)]
*  Let's bring battery storage to a new level, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1585.1200000000001s)]
*  going beyond lithium ion, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1587.5600000000002s)]
*  going beyond the current chemistries. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1588.92s)]
*  This is where we need to really focus more embracing, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1590.72s)]
*  yes, responsibly, of course, but making sure we lean in. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1594.3600000000001s)]
*  And I was pleased to see at the Paris AI Summit [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1598.2s)]
*  that we all just came from, that there was a lean-in attitude [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1600.44s)]
*  rather than two years ago when people were like, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1603.72s)]
*  oh, no, should we even touch this stuff? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1605.76s)]
*  So small teams, and let's lean in, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1607.24s)]
*  and let's solve the big problems in society now. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1609.68s)]
*  Amazing. It's a tear for that. Nice job, Jack. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1612.6000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1614.5600000000002s)]
*  Jim, what do you want people to take away [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1618.48s)]
*  from the work that you're doing? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1621.28s)]
*  What should they remember? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1622.96s)]
*  How should they utilize the tech that you're building? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1624.64s)]
*  Yeah, so AI doesn't have to be unbelievably expensive, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1628.64s)]
*  unbelievably big, unbelievably proprietary. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1632.92s)]
*  That's not required. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1636.92s)]
*  The computational hardware is fairly straightforward, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1638.3600000000001s)]
*  and we want to make that available to lots of people [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1641.88s)]
*  so they can use it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1644.24s)]
*  I think there is going to be a big upleveling [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1645.76s)]
*  on how we build and write software and build machines. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1648.3200000000002s)]
*  It shouldn't take two years to build a computer. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1651.1200000000001s)]
*  We want to pull that down. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1653.8400000000001s)]
*  It shouldn't take $10,000 to buy a single chip. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1655.04s)]
*  We're going to take that down drastically. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1658.1200000000001s)]
*  How much cheaper is the systems you're building compared to... [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1660.68s)]
*  Our target is 5 to 10x cheaper. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1663.2s)]
*  I'm sorry? 5 to 10x cheaper. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1665.16s)]
*  5 to 10x cheaper. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1666.88s)]
*  Than the current systems, and then we have a roadmap [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1667.88s)]
*  to continue to make that better. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1670.48s)]
*  And then the other piece is, like, you have to... [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1672.92s)]
*  I like the big swing approach on using AI, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1675.92s)]
*  but start small, right? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1678.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, I'm asking my software team [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1680.8000000000002s)]
*  to double their productivity this year, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1682.2800000000002s)]
*  and everybody's starting to use the code generators, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1684.3600000000001s)]
*  the code helpers. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1687.5200000000002s)]
*  We're building our own tools to go check the quality, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1689.04s)]
*  and just start working on it and get used to it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1692.0s)]
*  Because, like, you're right, if your system's broken, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1695.44s)]
*  like, patching up the broken system isn't quite right, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1698.16s)]
*  but getting a real feel for it and using it, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1701.0s)]
*  and then starting to iterate on how your system works [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1703.52s)]
*  is really important. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1706.0s)]
*  And I think everybody should, you know, dive in and embrace it, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1707.4s)]
*  but we don't have to solve world peace first. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1711.12s)]
*  I would like to make my code have a few less bugs. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1713.52s)]
*  Alexander, last words from you. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1716.56s)]
*  Who typically comes as a customer to Quantum Black, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1719.48s)]
*  and what is your value proposition that you offer them? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1722.48s)]
*  Is it, we're going to understand your problems [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1725.04s)]
*  and solve your problems? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1727.12s)]
*  No, basically, first of all, and it goes back to a question [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1728.72s)]
*  of what needs to be done, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1731.44s)]
*  the customer is the chairman of the CEO. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1732.9199999999998s)]
*  Unless number one in our head of the state [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1735.6s)]
*  is really interested in this problem [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1739.1599999999999s)]
*  and really going to invest her or his time, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1741.48s)]
*  don't waste your time. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1743.72s)]
*  It's not going to work. We're never going to do it. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1744.92s)]
*  It's so important, right? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1747.0s)]
*  Unless you've got buy-in from the very top of your organisation, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1748.2s)]
*  to be prepared to make yourself an AI first. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1751.8400000000001s)]
*  One of the biggest challenges a lot of companies have here, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1754.44s)]
*  you're not competing against your other typical companies, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1757.1200000000001s)]
*  you're competing against the start-up [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1760.8000000000002s)]
*  that is AI native from the beginning. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1763.0s)]
*  And it starts with your own literacy. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1766.4s)]
*  Because I think this room, and we grew up under the paradigm [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1768.52s)]
*  that unless I cannot explain you something in two minutes, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1772.0s)]
*  I'm probably incompetent. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1775.2s)]
*  And it's all right, but we need to speak the same language. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1776.8799999999999s)]
*  And the first thing is kind of go and study language. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1779.84s)]
*  And while we could claim that AI failed in many things, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1782.56s)]
*  but you could clearly see the drop of AI during summer. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1785.48s)]
*  And you ask yourself why? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1789.08s)]
*  Because all the kids are out of school or university, right? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1790.72s)]
*  Because AI was the best tutor to this world. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1793.52s)]
*  So first of all, use AI to educate yourself. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1795.8s)]
*  Kind of, that's number one. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1798.04s)]
*  Number two, why I'm saying it's a leadership challenge, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1799.76s)]
*  because what you need to do is really to go fully in [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1801.84s)]
*  to transform the enterprise. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1806.1599999999999s)]
*  You need to get the data right, that never is right. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1808.04s)]
*  You need to change your architecture. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1811.3999999999999s)]
*  That essentially means changing politics [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1813.3999999999999s)]
*  within the organization. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1815.1999999999998s)]
*  And we don't like to change politics. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1816.1999999999998s)]
*  Then hopefully you need to hire good people, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1818.56s)]
*  but then teach rest of the body of the church [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1821.0s)]
*  what the hell is it and how to ensure you embrace it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1824.7199999999998s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you have team with human beings [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1828.3999999999999s)]
*  and certain agents and kind of how do you operate it yourself. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1830.96s)]
*  Now you multiply the likelihood of these things [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1833.84s)]
*  and likelihood to success. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1836.6s)]
*  Unless you believe and go fully in, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1838.28s)]
*  it's risky because you put your career, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1841.32s)]
*  you put your company future on the line [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1843.24s)]
*  and you cannot go small. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1845.32s)]
*  You need to go big to succeed. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1847.04s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1848.56s)]
*  just use AI as the way to make the world [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1849.8s)]
*  into the better place. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1852.6399999999999s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, let's give it up [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbG2CWrmKTw&t=1854.28s)]
