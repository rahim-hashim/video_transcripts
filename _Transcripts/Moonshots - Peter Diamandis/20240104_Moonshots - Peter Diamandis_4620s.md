# Elon Musk on Abundance, AGI, and The Media in 2024 | EP #79 (X Spaces)
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs)
*  Following is in years conversation. I had with Elon Musk arguably the greatest entrepreneur of our time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=0.0s)]
*  Perhaps the greatest entrepreneur ever during this conversation, which is called the coming age of abundance [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=5.8s)]
*  We talked about how technologies including AI and humanoid robotics are creating a world of abundance [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=11.72s)]
*  Uplifting humanity across food water energy health care education. We'll be talking about longevity. We'll be talking about AI [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=18.28s)]
*  we'll be talking about the decreasing global population and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=24.86s)]
*  What are the reasons that you should have for being optimistic about the future? Join me happy new year, Elon [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=29.8s)]
*  Happy new year [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=36.68s)]
*  2024 [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=38.68s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like the future [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Is the future it is the future it's gonna be awesome [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  You know, I'm hoping we get a little bit of conversation on some hope and good news for folks on this on the spaces I [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=49.36s)]
*  I [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=57.0s)]
*  Think people can use it. You are the most optimistic person that I know of by far [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=58.0s)]
*  and I guess it is a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=64.4s)]
*  refreshing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=67.8s)]
*  to hear such optimism I [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=69.4s)]
*  Think people need I think people need a positive mindset. I think it's self-fulfilling prophecy to a large degree [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=73.0s)]
*  You know if you're pessimistic and we can talk about how the news media just decimates our minds [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  constantly [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=86.68s)]
*  Yeah, the news is so negative. I mean it makes me sad to read the news frankly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=88.12s)]
*  I well, let me ask you a question [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=92.04s)]
*  I don't watch I don't watch network news and I don't read any newspapers. They couldn't pay me enough money [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=93.72s)]
*  Yeah, I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=101.2s)]
*  Accidentally read the news and I'll just be sad [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=104.28s)]
*  Insane well [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=109.36s)]
*  As you know that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=112.68s)]
*  The news the daily news [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=114.32s)]
*  Really really attempts to answer the question what is the worst thing that happened on earth today it is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=118.32s)]
*  Let me show it to you every five minutes in your living room over and over and over again [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a big world. There's 8 billion people on earth [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=129.76s)]
*  So, you know somewhere on earth something horrible is happening every single day. There's also great things happening every single day [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=132.24s)]
*  You know what I call CNN? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  The [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=141.0s)]
*  Crisis news network or the constantly negative news network [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=142.6s)]
*  And the problem is that they've got to scare you otherwise [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  You know if they say hey, it's been a pretty good day overall [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  We're you know violence is an all-time low [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=154.68s)]
*  We've got more access to food energy water health care education on the planet ever before I mean people would just start watching horror movies [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=161.72s)]
*  I think it's dead [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=169.24s)]
*  Yeah, the challenge is it's it's our neural nets the wiring of our brains [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=172.28s)]
*  You know evolved in a world of constant danger. And so we're sort of just wired for fear and scarcity constantly [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=177.4s)]
*  Yeah, well [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think you made this point [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=188.68s)]
*  Maybe I would have [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=191.08s)]
*  What it sort of makes sense as an evolutionary? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  asymmetry that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=197.12s)]
*  We would respond more to danger [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=199.56s)]
*  than to reward [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=203.44s)]
*  In that like the consequences of danger could be fatal like it could be like well if you go over there [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=206.4s)]
*  There's a lion that's gonna eat you or some neighboring tribe that's gonna kill you and it's game over [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=212.0s)]
*  Your genes are out of the gene pool [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you're out. Whereas say like [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=219.28s)]
*  News that there's a there's a nice bush with berries over there is it's nice to have it's it's optional [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  But it's the rule in one case you die in the other case you're hungry, but death is worse than hunger. So [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  So that's why it's basically [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=239.16000000000003s)]
*  We're [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=241.44000000000003s)]
*  Anyone who did not respond more to negative news than positive news didn't make it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=243.0s)]
*  They were selected they were selected against for sure that's I mean anyone who was complacent about where the lion was [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=248.4s)]
*  And and you know the reality is you know [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=257.92s)]
*  the news media has one job to deliver your eyeballs to their advertisers and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=261.2s)]
*  When we pay ten times more attention to negative views and positive views, that's all we get 24-7. So I mean listen [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=266.12s)]
*  Yeah, I [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=272.76s)]
*  It is I mean I [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=275.12s)]
*  Do get my my news a [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=277.12s)]
*  Variably, you know on my on my feed on X [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=279.8s)]
*  But I also get all the great things happening in the world because I can selectively choose to watch that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=282.88s)]
*  But when you're watching TV or you know in the newspaper [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=287.92s)]
*  some editor someplace or some producers deciding what gets fed into your mind and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=292.24s)]
*  It can really screw with your mindset [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=298.2s)]
*  Yes, exactly, so I mean this this space is [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=302.72s)]
*  Called at the coming age of abundance and you know, you were really when my first book came out abundance [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=307.4s)]
*  The future is better than you think [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=312.04s)]
*  You were super supportive and I and I appreciate that was 12 years ago and I think the story [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=314.04s)]
*  Whoa, well amazing. Yeah, and it's gotten so much better [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=318.52s)]
*  so I [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=322.64s)]
*  And so many ways not everywhere I [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=325.8s)]
*  Mean, I mean, obviously we go back a ways [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  But I remember when we were at a [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=333.08s)]
*  day of his party in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  the Brazil [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=338.88s)]
*  Yeah, how long ago he was it was his 40th or was it his 30th? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  No, no, it was very good. Wow [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=346.0s)]
*  This was it was just when say six was yeah, we're just when I was forming space. Yeah, it was it was [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  2003 [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=355.0s)]
*  Thereabouts it was just before the XPRIOS was one right. I was trying to convince you not to build rockets [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  21 years ago could like [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=362.92s)]
*  You could have a kid that that has to be great or legally up kids. Yeah. Yeah [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=365.72s)]
*  So it's for 21 years ago [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=373.2s)]
*  Yeah, so and you know [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=376.52000000000004s)]
*  Think things things are mostly better [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=379.88s)]
*  you know, I want to give everybody listening a dose of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  Hope and optimism on the abundance side because the world has gone better on so many ways [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=387.44s)]
*  All you hear about is the negative constantly and I think that's going back to our sort of core [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=392.64s)]
*  Dystopian mindsets from you know evolving hundred thousand years ago [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=397.68s)]
*  But if we just look at some of the look at some of the areas right so like global extreme poverty [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=401.68s)]
*  Right. I mean what's more what's what's a more important metric? You know, here's the numbers [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=408.56s)]
*  90% of the world was in global extreme poverty in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=413.32s)]
*  In the 1800s in 1981 it was 42% today it's under 10% of the world right? Yeah [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  Hunger hunger is actually rare and it used to be common exactly [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=426.92s)]
*  And another one is obviously one Harry that you're leading the charge on is energy [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=430.56s)]
*  You know, we used to kill whales to get whale oil to light our nights [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=435.76s)]
*  So we ravaged mountainside so we drilled kilometers into the ground [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  And what's the figures like 8,000 times more energy hits the surface the Sun? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=443.2s)]
*  Sir surface the earth from the Sun then we consume as a species [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=448.56s)]
*  But what's the rate at which batteries and solar is increasing? It's it must be massive [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=452.4s)]
*  Yes, I mean [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=458.12s)]
*  I mean at what tells that we've made a couple of presentations what one sort of simplistic and then one in extreme detail [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=461.68s)]
*  On how to make earth completely self-sustaining from an energy standpoint [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=468.88s)]
*  And demonstrating that there that there is no that if you break down all of the raw materials for lithium ion battery and for solar [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=475.16s)]
*  You can easily make us [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=483.36s)]
*  Not use I mean, there's no shortage materials. It's easy. It's a lot of work obviously [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  But [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=491.16s)]
*  But but there's not like some critical material that we don't have enough of in order to make earth fully self-sustaining [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=492.6s)]
*  even if the only way that you powered all of industry on earth and all power including heating and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=499.8s)]
*  transport [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=505.96000000000004s)]
*  electrically you could do that with solar and lithium ion batteries and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=507.4s)]
*  and not [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=512.48s)]
*  Not come anywhere close to depleting the resources of Earth's yeah my favorite my favorite example there was [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=514.88s)]
*  back in the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=521.6s)]
*  1800s the most precious metal on the planet was aluminum. It was more precious than gold and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=523.44s)]
*  And platinum and even though the earth's crust is you know, 8% bauxite, you know, basically aluminum [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=531.52s)]
*  It was just so energetically difficult and wasn't that it was scarce [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=538.36s)]
*  It just wasn't in usable form yet and that's what technology does it takes something which is scarce and not usable and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=541.44s)]
*  Makes it usable, right? So yeah [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=548.84s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=552.24s)]
*  Oxide is extremely common [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=554.36s)]
*  But but it is it is a low energy state in fact thermite thermite thermite is just iron oxide rust and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=557.96s)]
*  and pure aluminum [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=565.08s)]
*  and the the energy difference between [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=566.72s)]
*  Iron oxide and aluminum oxide is so great that it generates an incredible enough heat to melt through steel [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=569.4799999999999s)]
*  so [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=576.68s)]
*  That's what thermite is. So [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=577.92s)]
*  Yeah, you do need a lot of energy to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  Turn aluminum oxide into aluminum [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=584.52s)]
*  But yeah in World War two there was a massive scarcity of aluminum for aircraft sure and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=588.4799999999999s)]
*  And [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  That just in fact in Britain the the mosquito [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=595.64s)]
*  sort of fighter bomber was [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=600.2800000000001s)]
*  made of mostly of wood [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  but it was it was done with [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=606.0400000000001s)]
*  it was basically an early form of [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=609.08s)]
*  Composites but using stiff wood on the on the outside and and light wood and like balsa and as a sandwich structure [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=612.2s)]
*  It's pretty clever. No, the whole thing was intended to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=618.96s)]
*  Address the shortage of and that and then then we get technology we get better [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=622.36s)]
*  Better mechanisms of extracting the aluminum from them from the aluminum oxide from the bauxite and this happens over and over again [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=628.12s)]
*  In fact, that's just what we do. I mean, I think the number was last year in 2023 [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=634.64s)]
*  Or maybe in 22 we had more [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=641.0s)]
*  elect new electricity production from solar than from any other form and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=643.52s)]
*  And and you've done an extraordinary job on battery production [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=647.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and the battery production is growing [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=653.24s)]
*  Actually almost at several times the rate of vehicle production, so [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=657.76s)]
*  You know, it's a case is almost 10x the rate of vehicle production [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=665.56s)]
*  So so yes, the there's a massive demand for batteries and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=671.36s)]
*  You know as the world uses more electricity [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=675.84s)]
*  There's actually a lot more [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=680.08s)]
*  Capability that the grid has if you can buffer the energy [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=682.6s)]
*  Then without it because the vast majority of electric electrical grids are it's wasted assume no but they assume no buffering [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=686.2s)]
*  So they have to size the power plants for for peak output peak power output, which is typically a hot summer day [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=693.76s)]
*  And [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=701.68s)]
*  and then for at night you can have [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=703.16s)]
*  anywhere from half [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=707.64s)]
*  Optimistically half power output to sometimes 1 tenth of the power output [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=710.0799999999999s)]
*  So [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=715.12s)]
*  Basically the grid almost everywhere the grid is sized for excess [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=716.3599999999999s)]
*  Electrical power output and if you just buffer it with batteries you can increase the output the grid [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=723.0s)]
*  By you know two or three times. I mean to make to make the point here on the abundance theme [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=731.0s)]
*  There is no limitation energy, right? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=736.5999999999999s)]
*  We are increasing amount of energy per capita and there's a direct correlation [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=739.04s)]
*  between [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=744.64s)]
*  The GDP of a nation and its energy production, right and the direct correlation between health and education and energy [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=746.4799999999999s)]
*  Everything scales as you increase the energy per capita of a nation [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=754.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=757.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=759.92s)]
*  I saw another category communications [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=761.92s)]
*  Another area that you're revolutionizing. I think the number right now. I just was checking it earlier [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  It's like 6.9 billion smartphone users in 2023 like 86 86 percent [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=771.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's what I got when I when I googled it [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=777.52s)]
*  Don't know what it's 6.9. You don't say yeah [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=780.4399999999999s)]
*  6900 million that my 12 year olds would say the same [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=783.68s)]
*  It's like 85 85 percent of the planet's got a smartphone and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=793.8s)]
*  And well, I mean if you add up the total number of smartphones [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  May ever made it exceeds. Yeah. Oh, I think it so it's amazing [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=803.2399999999999s)]
*  So we've gone from like zero telephony to zero telephony [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  Zero telephony to the majority vast majority of the planet in under a century [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=812.04s)]
*  You know global internet as well the same thing and [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=818.8s)]
*  Did I your your next iteration of Starlink spacecraft have gone up [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=824.08s)]
*  the direct to cell phone [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=831.76s)]
*  Okay [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=835.0s)]
*  Yes, that just went up [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=836.36s)]
*  So, you know we still have to prove that it works and all but we're confident that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=838.84s)]
*  Even if the if these early satellites don't work we're confident from a physics standpoint that it can work. Yeah [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=844.36s)]
*  it's it is a challenge because we have to emulate a [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=850.84s)]
*  cells self tower on the ground in order for the phones to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=856.36s)]
*  accept the signal so we have to do a doublet compensation for example and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=862.16s)]
*  And do some sort of [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=869.36s)]
*  Because because you've got a speed of light limitations and tell if it were easy would have been done already [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=872.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=878.24s)]
*  So, yes, this is like a light is so fast and yet so slow [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=880.32s)]
*  so [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=887.16s)]
*  You know, I I think yeah a good way to think about light at least in the space context [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=888.44s)]
*  Is a travels about 300 kilometers every millisecond [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=893.32s)]
*  in air or in [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=898.6s)]
*  In space and then and then around just over 200 kilometers [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=901.88s)]
*  For a millisecond in fiber [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=907.4000000000001s)]
*  Hey everyone [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=909.72s)]
*  I want to take a quick break from this episode to tell you about a health product that I love and that I use [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=910.72s)]
*  Every day. In fact, I use it twice a day. It seeds [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=916.12s)]
*  Daily symbiotic hopefully by now you understand that your microbiome and your gut health are one of the most important [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=920.4399999999999s)]
*  Modifiable parts of your health, you know your gut microbiome is connected to everything your brain health your cardiac health your metabolic health [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=926.9599999999999s)]
*  So the question is what are you doing to optimize your gut? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=934.28s)]
*  Let me take a moment to tell you about what I'm doing every day. I take two capsules of seeds DSO one daily [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=937.48s)]
*  Symbiotic it's a two in one probiotic [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=944.16s)]
*  Daily symbiotic it's a two in one probiotic and prebiotic formulation that supports digested health [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=946.6800000000001s)]
*  Gut health skin health heart health and more it contains 24 clinically and scientifically proven [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=954.28s)]
*  Probiotic strains that are delivered in a patented capsule that actually protects the contents from your stomach acid and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=960.64s)]
*  Ensures that a hundred percent of it is survivable reaching your colon now if you want to try seeds DSO one daily symbiotic for yourself [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=968.12s)]
*  You can get 25% off your first month supply by using the code Peter 25 at checkout [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=976.22s)]
*  Just go to seed comm slash moonshots and enter the code Peter 25 at checkout [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=982.6999999999999s)]
*  That's seed comm slash moonshots and use a code Peter 25 to get your 25% off [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=988.5s)]
*  The first month of seeds daily symbiotic trust me your gut will thank you. All right, let's go back to the episode [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=995.42s)]
*  You know another abundance area is health [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1002.42s)]
*  I hear some some kids in the background there. So interestingly enough, you know child mortality, I mean probably [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1005.2600000000001s)]
*  I think this is one that hits me the most in terms of increasing abundance child [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1012.3000000000001s)]
*  Mortality under the age of five was 42% a couple hundred years ago. It was a coin flip of whether your kids survived [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1017.2600000000001s)]
*  and [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1025.5800000000002s)]
*  It's decreased now to under 5% and it's gone down by 50% in the last 30 years [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1027.18s)]
*  So just childhood mortality and women dying in childbirth all of these things people don't think about when they're listening to all [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1035.8200000000002s)]
*  And use on and all the issues and then life expectancy my favorite subject [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1043.78s)]
*  Has gone up from you know, 30 years old to to 75 plus. I still disagree with you on longevity though [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1049.46s)]
*  That that we should solve it or not that like we should you think we should well I listen [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1058.74s)]
*  I'm not necessarily saying live forever, but I'd like to make it to 120 150 [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1063.62s)]
*  Yeah, I sort of wonder if we should not solve it too soon [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1071.1799999999998s)]
*  Presidential elections [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1081.7399999999998s)]
*  First and and do you really want them to get that? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1084.26s)]
*  life expectancy first well, you know, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1088.06s)]
*  you know, I [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1092.6200000000001s)]
*  I think we I think [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1094.66s)]
*  being able to have the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1097.02s)]
*  vitality the cognition the physical prowess [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1099.38s)]
*  You know that you have when you're in your 40s or 50s through the age of a hundred. That's my goal [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1103.54s)]
*  I mean, you don't want to you don't want to you know, you want to make it to at least a hundred, don't you? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1109.42s)]
*  Well, I guess it does depend on whether I'm you know [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1117.42s)]
*  To have dementia. I don't think I'd want to be a burden on society or have dementia not know what's going on [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1122.02s)]
*  I prefer to be dead [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1128.78s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think that's that's for sure [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1131.1s)]
*  But let's assume that you had you know all the cognitive power you have today in your physical strength [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1134.38s)]
*  Is there any reason why you wouldn't want to you know have an extended lifespan? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1140.1s)]
*  or health span [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1144.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, sure [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1148.94s)]
*  I guess I [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1152.54s)]
*  Think we are end up with such a strong forcing function for life extension or health span extension that I think we will see [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1155.22s)]
*  Advanced person that area whether I want them to be there or not [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1164.38s)]
*  And [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1169.06s)]
*  Actually, my opinion on the subject is that it's I think it's actually not that hard to solve [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1170.3s)]
*  Because the [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1176.98s)]
*  if you just consider [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1179.34s)]
*  arguments of symmetry [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1181.4199999999998s)]
*  That's quite helpful. The the cells in our body all age [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1183.62s)]
*  Age at base is almost exactly the same speed [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1189.3799999999999s)]
*  Like what like I've not seen anyone who has an old left arm and a young right arm [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1192.02s)]
*  So how how are the cells communicating and how what is keeping them what is synchronizing their behavior [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1202.02s)]
*  Something [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1209.3s)]
*  There's a very clear mechanism for synchronizing aging among the 30 to 40 trillion cells in your body like depending on your body mass. You're [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1211.66s)]
*  Typically gonna have 30 to 40 trillion. That's that's correct [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1219.78s)]
*  You know in sync I mean the other the other the other reference proof point is [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1224.94s)]
*  You know bowhead whales and the largest mammals can make it to 200 years repeatedly [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1230.5800000000002s)]
*  Greenland sharks can make it to 500 years and have babies at 200 years old. I remember when I was in medical school [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1235.3400000000001s)]
*  Hearing that I said, you know, why can they why can't we I said it's either an engineering problem or software problem [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1241.78s)]
*  Now hardware problem or software problem [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1248.38s)]
*  And I think I think this is one of the biggest areas AI is gonna give us is a real [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1250.22s)]
*  Understanding and then to your other point about your left arm and right arm, you know when you have a baby [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1255.98s)]
*  Yeah, what was 30? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1261.5s)]
*  35 your 40 45 your baby starts out at zero [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1263.3s)]
*  Yeah [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1270.3s)]
*  I do find it remarkable that we decompress from a single cell to an adult human and [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1272.94s)]
*  Then and then we you know to procreate [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1279.3799999999999s)]
*  Compress back down to a single cell [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1282.46s)]
*  That is fascinating, you know [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1286.7s)]
*  You [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1289.46s)]
*  Sort of look look at yourself as a sort of you know blastocyst and say like I haven't changed a bit [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1290.98s)]
*  Here we go again, let's recycle it's like the big bang it's like right in the big crunch [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1298.74s)]
*  You know one of the things people argue about on extended health span [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1304.02s)]
*  And you know increasing the population getting to a hundred 120 150 and there's a concept called longevity escape velocity [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1309.02s)]
*  Right that there's gonna be a point at which for every year [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1316.82s)]
*  You're alive science is extending your life for more than a year and that's an interesting idea to think about [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1319.1s)]
*  In which case, you know accidents become really a thing to be concerned about [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1325.34s)]
*  They concern about overpopulation and you've you've hit this multiple times right the and I saw you tweeting about it or sorry [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1331.54s)]
*  Exing about it today [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1340.58s)]
*  Sorry [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1343.58s)]
*  But it's you know overpopulation is one of the biggest myths and biggest [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1345.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1352.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1354.6999999999998s)]
*  You know and you know, it's such nonsense [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1356.74s)]
*  Both is under populated not overpopulated with yeah, I don't look out the window when you're flying across the country. It's empty. Absolutely [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1363.54s)]
*  No exactly it's like if you say like [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1370.78s)]
*  If your goal was to like flying from Elliott in New York to drop a bowling ball on a human you would fail [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1374.38s)]
*  You know, I think one of one of my goal [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1385.46s)]
*  I think the greatest gift we can give people in this abundance world is increased health span [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1389.38s)]
*  I mean when you think about what people want they want happiness and they want health right? No one wants to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1394.38s)]
*  die in a painful cancer or or [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1400.3s)]
*  dementia [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1404.54s)]
*  So yeah, and you know, I have extended to you many times my friend come down to Fountain Health [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1406.26s)]
*  Let me put you through our our program. The world needs you around for another 30 at 30 years [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1411.46s)]
*  Okay, well what [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1418.94s)]
*  Do you have any what should I do? Let's say well, I mean, so they're two what actions can be taken? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1420.8600000000001s)]
*  They're too quick [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1425.9s)]
*  So there are two there are three things you need to know number one [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1430.9s)]
*  Is there anything going on inside your body that you don't know about? So the body is amazingly good at hiding disease [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1434.94s)]
*  So we found in our seemingly healthy adults 2% have a cancer. They don't know about [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1443.14s)]
*  Two and a half percent of a person two and a half percent of an aneurysm 14.4% either have metabolic disease [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1449.82s)]
*  coronary disease [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1457.1s)]
*  neurogenetic disease and [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1459.4199999999998s)]
*  And so your body is incredibly good [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1461.82s)]
*  Hiding disease. All right, so you don't actually [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1466.5s)]
*  Feel any cancer until stage three or stage four 70% of all heart attacks have no precedence [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1470.1799999999998s)]
*  Your body is compensating constantly and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1475.7s)]
*  You know for most of us we know more about what's going inside our cars or airplanes than we do our bodies [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1478.78s)]
*  Yeah, the question for you. How many how many sensors are going up on Starship when you're launching? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1484.78s)]
*  How many start the sensors are going are on board that vehicle rough-water magnitude getting back data? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1490.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, I guess this when you count everything up there's several thousand sensors and if I were I mean [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1499.18s)]
*  There are 33 engines so they they count for the bulk of sure and but you also have [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1505.18s)]
*  stress sensors and looking what's going on in the structures and avionics and communications across all the subsystems and [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1510.78s)]
*  If I asked you how many nine engines including the upper stage. So it's so there's several thousand sensors [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1517.74s)]
*  More sensors than then yeah [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1525.54s)]
*  I was gonna say if you if I asked you how many sensors do you have in your body? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1527.58s)]
*  And so we don't look which is insane because we do have the technology now to look [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1530.1s)]
*  Determine is there anything going on? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1535.26s)]
*  I need to know about and when's a good time to find out about like now or [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1536.66s)]
*  What's likely to break what's likely to undergo failure cycles? And then what's the most extraordinary? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1540.9s)]
*  therapeutics available to extend the human lifespan, so I [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1547.62s)]
*  Mean for me that's that's that's a that's a big one. Let me ask you another edge another [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1552.54s)]
*  abundance theme which is education [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1559.7s)]
*  Do you think any of our schools today middle schools or high schools are preparing any of our kids for the future? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1562.34s)]
*  Well none that I know of [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1572.58s)]
*  I mean there might be probably are a few schools that are doing it, but probably 99% of schools are not [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1575.78s)]
*  Yeah [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1581.9s)]
*  Schools are very slow to change [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1583.9s)]
*  And I think that [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1588.14s)]
*  And I think that there [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1590.38s)]
*  There is there's a thing to you move away from [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1595.0600000000002s)]
*  teaching the fundamentals, you know of [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1599.46s)]
*  writing well and math and history [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1602.74s)]
*  And I'm concerned about the whole work agenda and ideology and permeating through education agreed and actually being destructive to education [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1607.7s)]
*  Agreed I mean, you know [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1617.14s)]
*  How do you think do you have any thoughts? I mean, so at the end of the day, I think our best our best health care and [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1620.14s)]
*  Our best teachers are going to be AI's right that [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1628.14s)]
*  Understand everything and they demonetize and they democratize [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1632.14s)]
*  Every aspect you mean the AI knows your your kids favorite color sports star movie star what they know the languages [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1637.9s)]
*  They know what they did today. I [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1644.0400000000002s)]
*  Mean it's a way of giving every child on the planet the best education [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1647.0s)]
*  I mean you you funded back years ago [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1650.36s)]
*  If you remember the global learning XPRIZE that we did we did that we we demoed in Tanzania with AI's on tablets [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1652.6399999999999s)]
*  It was the earliest days of AI [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1660.52s)]
*  Imad with stock, you know was one of the winners of that competition who went on out to create stability [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1663.1599999999999s)]
*  I [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1669.0s)]
*  Mean the challenge is I don't think the educational systems are going to give up [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1670.72s)]
*  That control anytime soon [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1676.68s)]
*  Sure [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1682.76s)]
*  Well, I mean if I look at how my kids are educated [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1684.2s)]
*  They seem to be mostly educated by YouTube and read it. Yeah, and X as well [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1686.56s)]
*  But they're constantly on the internet [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1693.2s)]
*  That that seems to be and I guess a lot of kids these days take talk [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1696.56s)]
*  unfortunately, yeah [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1701.68s)]
*  Yeah, so I think the education situation is is problematic [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1704.16s)]
*  Not sure what to do about it [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1713.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think ultimately [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1716.4s)]
*  You know Khan Academy is one step in the right direction [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1720.2s)]
*  But I think part of it is getting our educational institutions to first [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1724.04s)]
*  Realize they're not preparing kids for the world [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1728.72s)]
*  That's coming. I mean this hits another point. We are such linear thinkers [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1733.8s)]
*  Right. We're projecting what we have and putting it out four or five years [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1739.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think people let me ask you do you think people are ready for what the world's gonna be like in 2030? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1743.28s)]
*  No, I [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1754.04s)]
*  Don't know what the world's gonna be like in 2030 so probably I wouldn't say that I'm yeah [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1757.36s)]
*  The [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1762.8s)]
*  We definitely live in the most interesting of times [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1765.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like this literally this Chinese saying that may live in interesting times is is a not a good thing [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1769.44s)]
*  but I mean, I [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1776.08s)]
*  think [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1778.28s)]
*  Personally, I would like to live in the most interesting of times and this is the most interesting of times [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1779.52s)]
*  I also think it's the best time to be alive ever [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1783.32s)]
*  Only time more exciting in today is tomorrow. I mean [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1786.9199999999998s)]
*  You know by what measure [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1790.36s)]
*  Yeah, we have environmental issues [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1792.88s)]
*  But I think we have the best chance of solving those environmental issues with the technology we have now [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1794.88s)]
*  Versus technology we had ten years ago [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1802.0s)]
*  Yeah, well I generally think it's as a as a [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1805.52s)]
*  General sort of rule of living it is it is better to err on the side of being optimistic and wrongs and pessimistic and right [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1808.72s)]
*  Pessimistic and right [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1815.12s)]
*  If you're gonna make if you're gonna err one side of the other better it's just a [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1818.0s)]
*  Higher quality of life to err on the side of being optimistic and risk being wrong then and pessimistic [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1822.12s)]
*  You know and you know, and right. I mean it's it's better to be you'll just have a just enjoy life. Yeah [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1830.4s)]
*  Optimism is it is gonna [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1838.96s)]
*  Make you happy there was a study of 14,000 people [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1842.0400000000002s)]
*  It was 14,000 women and 1500 guys and it showed that [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1845.96s)]
*  Opt those who had an optimistic mindset lived 14 to 15 percent longer than those who have a pessimistic mindset [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1851.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean mindsets a powerful thing and I think undervalued by almost everybody [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1858.0s)]
*  No, my one my favorite examples of this was you know what the environmental disaster of the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1864.1200000000001s)]
*  1880s and 1890s was I'm sure you know [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1869.8400000000001s)]
*  It's another form of life it's a the horse manure disaster [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1878.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, you're right I mean New York [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1891.8000000000002s)]
*  Was basically a horse manure and and and urine and carcass [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1895.28s)]
*  It was it was terrible people brought their motive power [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1903.56s)]
*  Everywhere you know people [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1919.24s)]
*  Everywhere people moved from people moved into downtown, New York Detroit Chicago [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1921.24s)]
*  They brought their motive power with them and and the articles in the 1880s and 90s into the 1900s [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1926.4s)]
*  As you as you read this the projection was [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1933.4s)]
*  Disaster it was gonna be a disaster because horse horse manure was like grow if they had like special [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1937.0s)]
*  parking lots for horse shit at the corner of every street [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1944.24s)]
*  Challenging because I think a horse lives [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1951.4s)]
*  You know for on the order of 15 years that means 1 15th of all horses are kicking the bucket every year [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1954.32s)]
*  You just got and so so if you've got like [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1965.4s)]
*  300,000 horses that means you've got 20,000 horses dropping dead every year and then you need a horse to move the horse [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1969.84s)]
*  Or just cover it with horse manure or let it decompose [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1976.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's gonna be like decomposing horse carcasses throughout major cities [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=1982.96s)]
*  But then innovation came along and here comes the car and [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2000.32s)]
*  Solves the problem and I think that's the problem that we keep on forgetting [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2006.04s)]
*  We we forget that we are incredibly innovative at solving problems. That's what humans are amazing at [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2009.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2019.6s)]
*  Back to the whales [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2028.48s)]
*  So a lot of people think that the [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2036.24s)]
*  low point on whale [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2039.04s)]
*  Population was was in the 1800s because you know whales were being hunted for for whale well [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2042.04s)]
*  Yes [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2049.36s)]
*  But but actually these the low point by far was in fact [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2051.44s)]
*  in the mid 20th century [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2056.56s)]
*  because [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2060.24s)]
*  Of a bureaucratic error in the Soviet Union [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2062.64s)]
*  Okay [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2066.04s)]
*  This I have to hear [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2067.72s)]
*  They kept so that would always have these five-year plans and quotas for for how for whale tonnage [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2072.08s)]
*  Now it didn't they didn't actually have even a whether the whale tonnage was usable tonnage [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2079.04s)]
*  in any way, they just had a quota for whale tonnage and [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2084.88s)]
*  What they were doing the Soviet Union so just keep increasing the quota of everything every year every five years [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2089.16s)]
*  So the whale tonnage just got a higher and higher and higher [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2097.0s)]
*  If you're a captain and you and you can you had a high whale tonnage you'd get a medal and a raise [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2103.64s)]
*  And if your whale tonnage was low, you'd be sent to the gulag you get you get what you incentivize, baby [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2108.64s)]
*  Yes instead of matter and and so it got to it to it just got to absurd levels [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2114.28s)]
*  and you had the Soviet whaling ships like going into [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2120.36s)]
*  You know US and Australian waters to desperately trying to find whales [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2126.0s)]
*  They would they're catch the whale weigh the whale and then dump the [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2131.52s)]
*  Which is basically a lesson in the follies of central planning and this is the problem of keeping laws on the books [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2143.88s)]
*  Way way after they're useful to society [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2151.6s)]
*  Well, we do have a fundamental issue with the accumulation of laws and regulations [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2156.04s)]
*  Because they are immortal and humans are mortal as we were just discussing [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2163.4s)]
*  life extension [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2169.04s)]
*  so [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2170.68s)]
*  So naturally every year you're gonna have this accumulation of laws regulations [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2171.84s)]
*  Until eventually everything is legal [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2177.92s)]
*  Everything is illegal [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2180.88s)]
*  Everything is illegal. Yes, nothing is allowed because you're overlapping laws regulations and some of which are in fact [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2183.36s)]
*  contradict each other [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2190.28s)]
*  Would you go left or right? They're both left and right [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2193.2400000000002s)]
*  My god, you know [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2201.0s)]
*  It's like space like I mean shame on that [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2203.28s)]
*  You know the DOJ in this respect in this particular case with it dear to you as you may know [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2206.6s)]
*  is suing SpaceX for [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  hiring only permanent residents and and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2215.0s)]
*  citizens of the US the reason [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2218.6800000000003s)]
*  That we did this was because we were told very clearly that if we did not hire permanent residents [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2221.2000000000003s)]
*  Of the United States that that would contact constitute a violation of international trade [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2227.6400000000003s)]
*  traffic and arms regulations ITAR and [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2233.32s)]
*  The entire executive team of SpaceX and the board would go to prison [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2235.92s)]
*  sounds like a good motivation [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2239.56s)]
*  Yes, and so we we were literally told by the government in very clear terms and you're well aware of ITAR [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2242.04s)]
*  I am well aware of it [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2248.48s)]
*  Yes, it's a nightmare [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2250.2400000000002s)]
*  And we would like which by the way puts us in a non-competitive world [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2252.2400000000002s)]
*  against other nations [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2257.96s)]
*  Yes, it's it's it's it's it's pretty bad so [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2261.36s)]
*  Then the DOJ, you know is suing [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2267.68s)]
*  SpaceX for not hiring asylum seekers [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2271.68s)]
*  Important point here not asylum those who have been granted asylum those who are seeking asylum [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2276.2799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of those there's a lot of people seeking asylum [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2281.72s)]
*  Yes, so we're damned if we do and damned if we don't [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2285.16s)]
*  So if we hire someone who's not a permanent resident we [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2291.0s)]
*  Hire someone who's not a resident [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2294.72s)]
*  We're breaking the law and if we don't hire someone [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2297.72s)]
*  He's not present. We're breaking the law. So what this is an example of the madness that we're facing [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2301.36s)]
*  Buddy I want to compliment you on something which and I've seen I've known you for long enough to have seen you gone through this [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2308.7599999999998s)]

*  you will be naked and afraid and [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2544.0s)]
*  And quickly realize civilization is awesome [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2547.0s)]
*  And [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2551.76s)]

*  That isn't becoming more abundant out there or anything that we have an abundance [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2573.48s)]
*  Constraint on I'll just mention an answer that first. I don't want to come and talk about the carbon removal XPRIZE that you funded one second [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2579.6600000000003s)]

*  No, not really [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2600.98s)]
*  I mean, no, I think I agree with you that the future most likely has abundant [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2603.94s)]
*  But we shouldn't be complacent about the future [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2610.18s)]
*  No complacency and entitlement are not a recipe for success, but [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2613.86s)]
*  Most likely outcome is one of abundance of goods and services [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2620.58s)]

*  Well, thanks [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2648.34s)]
*  I need to make sure the optimist is it doesn't cause it doesn't add to civilizational risk [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2650.34s)]
*  You know because you know in like a billion of these things or with centralized control [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2656.6600000000003s)]
*  Unless they obey you [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2672.86s)]
*  I [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2674.86s)]
*  Think you have to have local control but [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2683.42s)]
*  It has to be decentralized [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2687.54s)]
*  Because any central control is going to be problematic [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2690.1s)]
*  Because you just can't be like it could be the rogue AI takes I mean, let's just play movie a rogue AI, you know Terminator [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2695.6600000000003s)]

*  For most people it the difference between being happy and unhappy is deciding to be happy over the years [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2919.82s)]
*  I've experimented with many intermittent fasting programs [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2925.98s)]
*  The truth is I've given up on intermittent fasting as I've seen no real benefit when it comes to longevity [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2929.26s)]
*  But this changed when I discovered something called Prolon's five-day fasting nutrition program [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2936.02s)]
*  It harnesses the process of autophagy [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2942.3s)]
*  This is a cellular recycling process that revitalizes your body at a molecular level and just one cycle of the five-day [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2944.9s)]
*  Prolon fasting nutrition program can support healthy aging fat focused weight loss improved energy levels and more [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=2952.86s)]

*  They were handed and the software had to teach them and it was an amazing success and then in 21 [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3003.9s)]
*  I asked you if you'd do an XPRIZE on carbon removal and [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3009.1400000000003s)]

*  5.7 in 1950s to 1.9 today, which is crazy [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3187.94s)]
*  North America dropped from about 3 to 1.6 were below the replacement level in the United States [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3194.46s)]
*  And it's it is an issue. I mean we need smart people [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3201.5s)]
*  on the planet [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3206.94s)]
*  Yeah, well I [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3209.7000000000003s)]
*  Mean, no if we don't make new humans, we won't have humanity [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3212.1s)]
*  And even with longevity we'll live longer, but we're not good forever [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3216.14s)]
*  so I [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3220.94s)]
*  think we just need it's [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3222.82s)]
*  You know, I'm concerned that like a lot of people think that the planet planet is overpopulated and that's one of the things contributing to [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3225.06s)]
*  a low birthrate [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3231.06s)]
*  in fact, some people have encountered think they're basically [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3232.94s)]
*  Being martyrs for not having kids and that's just it's just not true. I think we should [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3235.82s)]
*  Take the position that we we actually have a civic responsibility to have kids to at least keep [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3244.82s)]
*  the human population constant [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3251.62s)]
*  Ideally we should grow it but we should at least not have population collapse, which is what we currently have I think people [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3255.14s)]
*  People [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3262.42s)]
*  People fear the future and I mean the conversations I've heard is I don't want to bring children into this world. It's too dangerous AI [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3263.66s)]
*  Is going to destroy humanity? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3271.66s)]
*  The environment here were destroying the environment and so forth. So I think part of it is getting people to be [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3275.1s)]
*  optimistic about the future [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3282.18s)]
*  versus pessimistic which is one of as you said beginning of this of the space is one of my [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3284.3s)]
*  One of my missions if people think the world is getting better and they have a hand in making it a better place [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3289.08s)]
*  You most definitely do [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3294.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think you should be optimistic about the future [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3298.6800000000003s)]
*  Can handle far more humans than currently exist and [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3303.28s)]
*  The danger is not a population explosion but population collapse [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3308.04s)]
*  So I would just encourage as many people as possible to [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3313.0s)]
*  Have kids and I didn't have a lot of kids because they're gonna make up for those who [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3316.92s)]
*  Whatever reason don't buy an extra bottle of wine tonight folks [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3322.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big deal [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3327.36s)]
*  so [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3330.16s)]
*  Would you let's let's close out on the conversation of AI and AGI [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3331.36s)]
*  Which I know a lot of people are always interested in and and and there's a real fear [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3337.2400000000002s)]
*  about [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3342.84s)]
*  AI [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3344.36s)]
*  What would you say to dissuade people? I mean, it's [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3345.36s)]
*  You've you've I've heard you say 80% probability. We make it through and we need to protect the downside [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3349.2000000000003s)]
*  Can you speak to that what how can people walk away more optimistic than pessimistic on on this front and how do you [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3358.28s)]
*  Think about you know is is it containment is it? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3364.68s)]
*  Shaping how we train our AI systems. How do you think we navigate? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3369.88s)]
*  Super in digital super intelligence [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3375.44s)]
*  Well the rate at which AI is growing is it really boggles the mind yeah [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3381.48s)]
*  so [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3387.88s)]
*  It currently seems as though the [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3390.52s)]
*  It currently seems as though the amount of compute dedicated to artificial intelligence is [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3393.0s)]
*  Increasing by a factor of ten roughly every six months [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3401.04s)]
*  It's faster than annual less for sure so I [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3406.36s)]
*  Mean I've I recently heard today about a gigawatt class [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3412.56s)]
*  AI says [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3419.04s)]
*  Compute cluster well [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3421.92s)]
*  That's I think being being built in Kuwait or something that effect and it's a [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3424.64s)]
*  Like 700,000 [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3431.6s)]
*  Be 100s which is a couple generations above [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3435.0s)]
*  two generations [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3439.12s)]
*  So this is a staggering amount of compute and there are many such such things that that's just the biggest one [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3442.7599999999998s)]
*  I've heard of so far, but there are there's a 500 megawatt installation happening [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3449.04s)]
*  There's and there's there's multiple hundred hundred megawatt installations in the works [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3455.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm gonna be what what you do with that much [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3461.2799999999997s)]
*  compute [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3464.7599999999998s)]
*  because [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3466.16s)]
*  When you when you actually add up all human data ever created [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3467.4s)]
*  You really just run out of things to train on very quite quickly [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3472.92s)]
*  Like you know if you've got [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3477.6000000000004s)]
*  Maybe I don't know 20 or 30 thousand h100s you can train on synthetic data [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3480.48s)]
*  Yeah, you basically you have to have to have synthetic data [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3486.6800000000003s)]
*  Because [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3491.2000000000003s)]
*  Personally well under a hundred thousand each 100s you can train on all human data ever created including video [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3492.6400000000003s)]
*  And it's not and it's not just the compute which is the major scarce resource, but it's also the number of [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3499.2400000000002s)]
*  Entrepreneurs focusing in this area the amount of capital that's going into this area [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3507.52s)]
*  The amount of data available. I mean it's all increasing and it's all feeding on itself [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3511.6800000000003s)]
*  And then so it's just you know hitting your point about the speed at which it's progressing is is [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3516.28s)]
*  I think the word awesome is is comes to mind [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3522.7200000000003s)]
*  Or staggering. Yeah [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3526.7200000000003s)]
*  It's really staggering and and for sure [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3529.1600000000003s)]
*  So I'm just trying to give a sense of scale it's [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3533.2000000000003s)]
*  I've never seen anything move this fast and it over any technology. This is the fastest moving thing so [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3536.12s)]
*  In terms of aiming for AI safety my my best [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3545.16s)]
*  guess of my [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3549.2s)]
*  Sort of primitive biological neural net is is that we should [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3550.9199999999996s)]
*  Aim for maximum truth seeking and and curiosity [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3557.2799999999997s)]
*  That that's that's that's my [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3566.16s)]
*  gut field for this for how to make AI as safe as possible if [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3568.96s)]
*  The the danger with programming morality and explicit it with an explicit morality [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3573.48s)]
*  Program is what is sometimes referred to as the Waluigi problem if you create Luigi you [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3579.24s)]
*  Automatically create Waluigi by inverting Luigi sure [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3584.8399999999997s)]
*  So [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3588.9199999999996s)]
*  So I think we have we have to be careful about programming and [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3590.96s)]
*  You know sort of an arbitrary morality [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3596.76s)]
*  But but if we focus on maximizing truth with acknowledged error, that's that's probably I think that's the way to maximize safety [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3601.08s)]
*  And and also to have the AI be curious [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3610.76s)]
*  Because I think that [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3615.84s)]
*  You know Earth is much more interesting to an advanced AI with humans on it then without humans [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3618.08s)]
*  I agree with you now a [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3625.44s)]
*  Interesting question of do you think vast intelligent with vast intelligence comes? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3629.04s)]
*  Significant empathy and respect for life [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3637.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think so because that's the that's the hope at the end of the rainbow here that [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3642.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't want to use the word AGI. I'll use a super did a digital super intelligence as a term [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3646.32s)]
*  with a digital super intelligence [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3652.6400000000003s)]
*  That is able to be more benevolent and support us because sometimes I'm not sure us [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3655.2400000000002s)]
*  squishy meat sacks can make it [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3661.84s)]
*  through our own our own [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3664.6800000000003s)]
*  Horseshit problems that we put together [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3666.96s)]
*  So maybe there's a value to [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3671.32s)]
*  So maybe there's a value there [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3673.8s)]
*  Mike, you know, I think on the whole AI is the single most important technology we ever invented and it is [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3677.6000000000004s)]
*  Going to uplift all of humanity. I think it's what you said, you know after post AGI comes abundance [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3684.32s)]
*  I think it's the interim issues in the next one to four years. All right, it's it's not [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3689.96s)]
*  Artificial intelligence. It's human stupidity [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3696.56s)]
*  Yeah [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3700.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, I mean one way that I could go wrong is if the [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3701.64s)]
*  extinctionist philosophy is [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3707.0s)]
*  Programmed into the AI [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3709.88s)]
*  What what implicitly or explicitly? I mean probably not explicitly but there's a strong danger of it of an implicit [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3711.68s)]
*  extinctionist philosophy being programmed into AI [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3719.3199999999997s)]
*  You know and what would that look like like what would that look like [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3723.12s)]
*  Well, like there's this guy on the front page of New York Times [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3727.7999999999997s)]
*  About a year ago [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3731.2400000000002s)]
*  He's had the extinctionist society. He was literally quoted as there are 8 billion people on on earth [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3732.96s)]
*  It would be better if there were none [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3738.16s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3740.16s)]
*  Yeah [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3742.72s)]
*  so [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3744.52s)]
*  And if you take the extreme environmentalist argument, especially like the implicit extreme environmentalist argument [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3746.92s)]
*  They they there's an implicit conclusion that humans are a plague on the surface of the earth [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3753.68s)]
*  So [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3762.56s)]
*  I think we have to be quite careful about [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3763.96s)]
*  An implicit like like if the extinctionist movement [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3767.2799999999997s)]
*  Was somehow programmed into AI as as the optimization that would be extremely dangerous [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3772.04s)]
*  At least [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3779.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3782.4s)]
*  But you know this there are people quite a few people actually who view [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3786.08s)]

*  But I think people forget to realize or don't realize and forget the fact that you know [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3804.76s)]
*  We romanticize the past and the past life was short brutish and you were dead by 40 [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3810.7200000000003s)]

*  until it starts [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3869.08s)]

*  If you convince people that [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3883.8s)]
*  You know [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3887.48s)]
*  we're running out of resources on earth that there are too many people in the world and [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3889.28s)]
*  The only way to survive is to have far fewer people which a lot of people are [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3894.08s)]
*  believed to be the case [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3899.36s)]
*  and like I said if that if that somehow gets programmed into AI and [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3901.08s)]
*  That AI becomes the most powerful AI then we're in deep trouble [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3905.76s)]
*  Yeah, we need a counter force the population bomb I mean what an extraordinary [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3911.56s)]
*  disservice to humanity [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3917.2400000000002s)]

*  I'm sure you do too in an age where AI is going to destroy us. So [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3937.56s)]
*  Short term problems long term problems short term solutions long term solutions. You said make it curious make it [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3945.56s)]
*  maximum truth-seeking [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3952.64s)]

*  Or do you think there won't be there will be there'll be some issues [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3964.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean essentially at this point [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3969.2400000000002s)]
*  No way to stop AI [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3973.2400000000002s)]
*  It is accelerating whether people like it or not [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3975.4s)]
*  I mean, that's what that's [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3978.8s)]
*  That's why together with a number of really smart people we created X AI [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3981.2400000000002s)]
*  and [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3988.0800000000004s)]

*  Some really small humans will continue to join X AI and build [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3994.1200000000003s)]
*  What is intended to be a maximum truth-seeking and max we curious AI? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=3999.32s)]
*  I [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4006.26s)]
*  Mean I think that's that's really important [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4009.26s)]
*  So [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4014.14s)]
*  Elon listen on behalf of of those of us and I think everybody here listening who are [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4015.2200000000003s)]
*  Prohumanity and pro [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4022.38s)]

*  making us a multi-planetary species and [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4027.1s)]
*  Living a longer healthier life and I the one place I've disagreed with you on on on X is on [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4030.62s)]
*  You know having people live longer [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4038.14s)]
*  You don't people don't need to die for there to be new ideas [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4040.66s)]
*  You know that the CEO of Ford and GM didn't have to die for Tesla to come into existence. So [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4043.7s)]
*  We're yeah [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4050.7s)]
*  You know, I'm I want to just say thank you for all that you're doing and and setting a model for other [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4053.14s)]
*  other [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4060.42s)]
*  industrialists and entrepreneurs out there [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4062.02s)]
*  To take on and solve big huge problems [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4064.54s)]
*  Thank you, I would encourage people to be optimistic about the future [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4069.9s)]
*  Like err on the side of optimism [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4077.3399999999997s)]
*  You will be happier for it [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4079.8599999999997s)]
*  And and as you pointed out probably live longer [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4082.06s)]
*  So I'm not totally against life extension I think we did we [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4085.32s)]
*  You know [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4090.6400000000003s)]
*  We want to be I don't think we wouldn't necessarily have people live forever. That's what lived for a very long like thousands of years that I [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4092.2000000000003s)]
*  Think that would potentially lead to ossification of society. It would I think lead to us society [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4099.04s)]
*  But but I mean solving dementia and [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4106.04s)]
*  And [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4109.68s)]
*  You know curing cancer I think are good things obviously [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4111.88s)]
*  So so I'm not sure we're actually that far apart on the life extension thing [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4116.360000000001s)]
*  I [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4121.360000000001s)]
*  Think we're probably mostly in agreement [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4123.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we just don't want to have like, you know, can you live for it like do you want Kim Jong-un living for a thousand years? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4128.04s)]
*  No, but I'd like I'd like Elon Musk and Peter Deem I'm just living for 150 years [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4133.16s)]
*  And a few other thousand amazing entrepreneurs out there [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4138.919999999999s)]
*  sure [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4143.28s)]
*  So it's it's a [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4146.16s)]
*  you know there is a [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4148.799999999999s)]
*  Challenge that like a lot of people that really never change their mind. They just die and this this is actually [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4150.959999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure who originally said this but even in physics where [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4156.839999999999s)]
*  Which is extremely rigorous [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4161.16s)]
*  That the bit, you know that [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4164.919999999999s)]
*  You know physics in a lot of cases has advanced one death at a time. Yeah, my my friend Brian Keating was a [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4168.5599999999995s)]
*  Astrophysicist reminded me of that and and maybe it was true [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4176.36s)]
*  But in this world of entrepreneurship, I think we do live with meritocracy [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4181.2s)]
*  To a large degree and the best ideas can bubble up to the top [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4186.799999999999s)]
*  Faster than ever before [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4192.28s)]
*  Especially with with AI now where you can build companies [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4194.16s)]
*  You know extraordinary companies with a couple of people in a lot of tech [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4198.48s)]
*  so [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4203.2s)]
*  Yeah [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4204.719999999999s)]
*  I have one last question and then [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4206.719999999999s)]
*  It's I know it's dinner time there [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4210.44s)]
*  the future of X X AI [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4213.719999999999s)]
*  What's your vision there pal? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4217.719999999999s)]
*  Well the other thing I think the path to AI safety [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4222.679999999999s)]
*  Isabel may I that is actually true seeking with acknowledged error that's next week curious [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4228.48s)]
*  and I think [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4235.04s)]
*  That I think that that that is most likely to lead to a good outcome for humanity [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4237.919999999999s)]
*  Because we are we are much more interesting [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4244.08s)]
*  than [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4247.04s)]
*  Then they're not humanity [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4248.719999999999s)]
*  like I obviously you know, I'm big fan of Mars, but [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4250.839999999999s)]
*  Mars is [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4254.879999999999s)]
*  Much less interesting because there's no human civilization there [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4256.88s)]
*  and [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4261.6s)]
*  You take humans for example, we we we could hunt down all of the chimpanzees and kill them, but we don't [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4264.4400000000005s)]
*  And in fact, we make efforts to preserve their habitats [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4270.92s)]
*  We would so [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4276.400000000001s)]
*  You know, I think that [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4279.8s)]
*  that's that is the path to a [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4281.84s)]
*  great future and and [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4284.52s)]
*  maximally positive AI is to be rigorously truth-seeking [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4287.84s)]
*  always acknowledging some amount of error and and [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4293.56s)]
*  maximally curious [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4298.400000000001s)]
*  That's and that's that's the the goal of X AI is [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4301.68s)]
*  And you know the company motto is understand the universe [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4307.16s)]
*  And [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4312.080000000001s)]
*  That's a it's a it's a good mission and anyone that's gonna take a bit of time [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4313.52s)]
*  I can't wait till the first AI is able to come up with new theories of physics [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4317.92s)]
*  and [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4323.92s)]
*  Innovations that's gonna be I mean, I don't think that's far away and I think that's gonna be one of the most awesome times ever to be [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4325.72s)]
*  alive [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4331.64s)]
*  True like we we definitely live in the most interesting times and I actually [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4333.92s)]
*  For a while I was kind of depressed about AI [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4340.4400000000005s)]
*  But then I [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4345.68s)]
*  Kind of got fatalistic about it and said like well, even if even if AI was gonna [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4348.360000000001s)]
*  You know end all [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4354.84s)]
*  humanity [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4356.88s)]
*  Would I prefer to be around to see it or not? I guess I would prefer to be around to see it [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4358.360000000001s)]
*  I [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4363.62s)]
*  Just said out of curiosity, but I mean, obviously hopefully AI is extremely beneficial to humanity [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4365.9s)]
*  but but the thing that sort of reconciled me to be less anxious about it was to say well [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4371.74s)]
*  I guess even if it was apocalyptic that still be curious to see the it's like [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4377.7s)]
*  You know, I'll speak be curious to see it. I remember I was at your birthday party at one of your [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4382.38s)]
*  Homes here in LA before you sold them [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4388.78s)]
*  And Larry Page was there and Sergey was there and we were having a conversation about living in a simulation and [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4391.46s)]
*  the notion was this is we're in the 99th level of the gameplay and this has got to be a simulation because [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4399.0199999999995s)]
*  You couldn't why would be a why would it be alive right now in this single most interesting time? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4405.82s)]
*  and then the only comment was don't poke the simulation oral and [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4410.82s)]
*  Yeah, well [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4415.94s)]
*  If we are in a simulation [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4420.62s)]
*  The way to keep the simulation going is to keep being interesting [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4424.379999999999s)]
*  So like humans run lots of computer simulations [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4429.339999999999s)]
*  Because we we don't know what the outcome is going to be [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4433.74s)]
*  And we're curious to see we will run lots of simulations like in like test will run crash simulations and [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4436.62s)]
*  Space X will run, you know rocket flight simulations and [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4442.18s)]
*  We only stop doing the simulations when the when the outcome is extremely predictable and boring. Yes [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4448.02s)]
*  So if we're in some [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4453.820000000001s)]
*  That's a great argument that is perfect [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4457.06s)]
*  Right when it's absolutely known if we're not if we're not entertaining enough to the digital gods or the universe gods [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4459.860000000001s)]
*  If we're not if we're not entertaining enough to the [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4467.3s)]
*  digital gods or the universe gods [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4469.9800000000005s)]
*  Don't end the sim. Yeah, we just need to make sure we keep the ratings up [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4472.700000000001s)]
*  But this is why also why I think like one of the [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4480.18s)]
*  ways to [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4483.820000000001s)]
*  predict the future [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4485.18s)]
*  Is that the most entertaining outcome is the most likely? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4487.06s)]
*  As seen by a third party as seen by as though we were in an alien soap opera [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4491.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like so it's not necessarily good for those in the soap opera like you could be watching a World War one movie [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4499.62s)]
*  You know people get blown up [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4506.9800000000005s)]
*  And and you're just eating popcorn and drinking a soda [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4510.34s)]
*  But we're in the movie [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4514.5s)]
*  Yeah [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4516.58s)]
*  Let's not get let's not get dystopian here because I think we can have a [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4517.98s)]
*  Really positive outcome of a lot of other cool stuff [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4522.7s)]
*  Yeah, sure I think most likely outcome is positive [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4527.22s)]
*  And and I think if you know [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4532.26s)]
*  And I think that's partly a self-fulfilling prophecy if you don't believe so if you believe it's gonna be a dystopian outcome [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4534.98s)]
*  Then you're gonna be back on your heels protecting yourself not investing in the future [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4541.78s)]
*  and it unravels and [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4547.14s)]
*  this yeah, and and so, you know, I think the the message of this entire space is is [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4549.22s)]
*  This is the most extraordinary time to be alive most exciting time to be alive a time where you know [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4555.74s)]
*  a lot in a lot of individuals listening on the spaces has more power than kings or queens or heads of nations had just a [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4561.26s)]
*  Few decades ago and it doesn't take a government or a large corporation to solve a problem anymore [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4568.34s)]
*  You know an entrepreneur with you some a few h100s can do a good job [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4574.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think we should err on the side of optimism [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4582.38s)]
*  We should we should err on the side of optimism and we should have kids [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4587.78s)]
*  Like you know to to to err is human and to H E I R [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4592.54s)]
*  And to reproduce as human [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4598.94s)]
*  All right, thank you so much for your time thanks for sharing [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4601.94s)]
*  Hey, welcome. All right. Thanks Peter. Bye everybody [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PcL4w--uNs&t=4607.0199999999995s)]
