# Whole Foods Founder on American Health Care, AI and Lack of Quality of Food w/ John Mackey | EP #112
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc)
*  When Whole Foods started, I didn't think I was entering the grocery business really. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=0.0s)]
*  If you're not old enough or too old, as old as me, you don't know how bad supermarkets [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4.32s)]
*  were 40 or 50 years ago and how they changed so much in the last 40 or 50 years, partly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=8.68s)]
*  because of Whole Foods Market. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=14.68s)]
*  I really enjoyed reading in the whole story your experience with psychedelic journeys. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=16.16s)]
*  While sometimes that's very, very healthy and you need that kind of energy to do a startup, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=23.8s)]
*  you also need your next creative journey. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=28.3s)]
*  You're on your next startup. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=30.82s)]
*  You exit Amazon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=32.06s)]
*  I had to let go of Whole Foods to really do Love Life, to get all in. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=33.68s)]
*  Everybody, welcome to Moonshots. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=37.9s)]
*  On today's episode, I'm going to be having a conversation with an extraordinary entrepreneur [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=44.14s)]
*  and CEO, John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=48.06s)]
*  He built the company to $22 billion in sales, 540 locations before selling it to Amazon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  And then that was Act 1. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=58.5s)]
*  Today he is starting his next company, Love Life. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=60.94s)]
*  During this episode, we're going to talk about a number of things. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=64.76s)]
*  How does he think about starting a company? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=67.3s)]
*  A lot of incredible lessons here for entrepreneurs on how he hires, how he funds things, who [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=68.98s)]
*  he brings in as co-founders, his conversations around marketing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=74.7s)]
*  This is somebody who built an extraordinary organization, starting his next company, and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=79.22s)]
*  we dissect step by step what he's doing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=83.98s)]
*  It's a master class for entrepreneurs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=86.82s)]
*  From there, we go on to talk about Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, what life is like for them, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=89.41999999999999s)]
*  how they think about the world. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=93.77999999999999s)]
*  And then we close the conversation talking about psychedelics, something that he's been [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  very open with in his new book, The Whole Story. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=98.33999999999999s)]
*  Powerful technology that has shaped his life. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=102.82s)]
*  We'll discuss what it means and where he's going next. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=105.3s)]
*  By the way, if you enjoy conversations like this with Moonshot entrepreneurs, subscribe. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=108.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=113.42s)]
*  Let's jump into the episode with John Mackey and The Whole Story. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=114.3s)]
*  Hey, John, I just finished reading The Whole Story. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=117.06s)]
*  It was an amazing book. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=120.5s)]
*  It's a book of entrepreneurial journeys and really it's the whole startup story, which [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=122.98s)]
*  I think anybody listening on about to start your company or facing incredible uphill battles. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  It's a book, a master class in how to overcome things. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=139.5s)]
*  So amazing job on that first off. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=144.18s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=146.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=147.34s)]
*  I question for you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=148.34s)]
*  You had zero background in, I still calling you a grocer feels very underwhelming. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=150.98s)]
*  He had zero background in starting a global health food store. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=158.74s)]
*  The question I have is, do real disruptions come from entrepreneurs who enter a field [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=166.5s)]
*  from right field, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  Who have no background, don't know what can't be done. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=174.7s)]
*  Does it really take that level of naivete to come in and disrupt an industry? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=179.26s)]
*  Because that's what I'm seeing in so many different places, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=183.82s)]
*  Bezos had no information on the book selling business. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=187.5s)]
*  Elon was not in the automotive or rocket business. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=191.29999999999998s)]
*  You weren't in the whole foods business. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=194.26s)]
*  It's a category by itself. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=197.34s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=198.34s)]
*  Well I think that's at least mostly true. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=200.89999999999998s)]
*  There's always going to be exceptions, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=205.1s)]
*  You could say Steve Jobs was doing some computer stuff before he started Apple and Bill Gates [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=208.1s)]
*  was doing some programming before he started Microsoft. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  So they were in the industry but they were both very young industries, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=217.34s)]
*  So they disrupted them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=222.26s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=224.17999999999998s)]
*  I know what Jeff Bezos, knowing Jeff a little bit from working at Amazon for five years [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=225.17999999999998s)]
*  after Whole Foods was sold to Amazon, he actually believes that industry think is one of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  things that holds innovation back. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=238.06s)]
*  This is the way we do things and I know Jeff's philosophy is let's rethink, go back to first [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=242.62s)]
*  principles. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  First principles is a way Elon Musk thinks as well. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=250.34s)]
*  What are the first principles here? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  What are the limitations? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=254.86s)]
*  In other words, let's not be stuck in a box and oftentimes coming from the outside, you're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=255.86s)]
*  able to see things like that child who said, hey the emperor doesn't have any clothes on. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=262.3s)]
*  You're not stuck in sort of a blindness that comes from things being too familiar. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=267.3s)]
*  So yeah, I agree with you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=271.42s)]
*  So talking to those entrepreneurs who are like, okay, I'm super excited about this industry [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=273.48s)]
*  but I have no background in it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=278.86s)]
*  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=281.98s)]
*  And how do they enter, in your opinion, as you know, how should they be entering this? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, for one thing, most of the time the entrepreneur doesn't think they're entering [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=290.5s)]
*  into an industry at all. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=294.38s)]
*  I mean, they're just excited about something. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=296.7s)]
*  They're passionate about something. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=299.52s)]
*  And I mean, when Whole Foods started, I didn't think I was entering the grocery business [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  really. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=306.18s)]
*  I was, but I thought Whole Foods was so different than people don't know what, if you're not [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=307.22s)]
*  old enough or too old, as old as me, you don't know how bad supermarkets were 40 or 50 years [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=312.3s)]
*  ago and how they changed so much in the last 40 or 50 years, partly because of Whole Foods [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=317.3s)]
*  market. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=322.98s)]
*  Walmart, obviously, had a big influence as well as did Costco. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=323.98s)]
*  And we didn't think, we just, we were passionate about selling healthy food to people, passionate [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=328.22s)]
*  about natural organic foods, helping people to live longer, helping people to feel better. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  And so we actually differentiated ourselves. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=340.06s)]
*  We didn't know how the grocery industry worked. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=343.74s)]
*  None of us had any experience in it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=345.7s)]
*  So we kind of reinvented the wheel in some instances, but we weren't trapped in that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  industry think. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=352.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=353.86s)]
*  You know, for me, you limit your own thinking when you're too knowledgeable in an industry. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=354.86s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=363.66s)]
*  And I think that was there when Elon was starting SpaceX, and he just came to it from two different [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  emotional energies, frustration about what existed, and then passion about what could [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=371.54s)]
*  exist. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=378.54s)]
*  And I think that was probably true for you as well. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=379.82000000000005s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=382.42s)]
*  I mean, I think the ingredients then are really a vision and frustration. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=383.42s)]
*  Is that fair enough to say? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=390.14000000000004s)]
*  You know, I think though that you may be giving me too much credit in the sense that when [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=391.58s)]
*  I started the business with my girlfriend Renee, we were so young. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=396.78s)]
*  I was 24 and Renee was 20. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=400.78s)]
*  And we really initially, we just wanted to sell, we just wanted to have a natural food [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=403.94s)]
*  store. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=407.46s)]
*  It was totally wrong. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=408.46s)]
*  We had it in an old Victorian house. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=409.46s)]
*  It wasn't on a commercial road. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=412.24s)]
*  We lived in the store on the third floor. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=414.36s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=416.26s)]
*  Took showers in the Hobart dishwasher. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=417.26s)]
*  And so we were just, you know, people said, why did you start it? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=419.16s)]
*  I thought, and the answers are, well, I wanted to sell healthy food to people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=422.44s)]
*  I wanted to earn a living and I wanted to have fun. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  And so we did all three of those things. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=429.88000000000005s)]
*  And in some ways, that's still happening for Whole Foods today. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=432.3s)]
*  And so the dream, you might say, grew. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=435.6s)]
*  It wasn't, I didn't have it initially. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=439.04s)]
*  I just wanted, I had a little dream and gradually the dream got bigger and bigger and bigger. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=441.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=447.32000000000005s)]
*  You know, I was curious in reading your book about the fact that you didn't fulfill your [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=448.48s)]
*  parents' dreams of going and getting these advanced degrees and such. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=455.18s)]
*  And you pursued your passion. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=460.74s)]
*  And I know I had a, not quite the same, but I went to medical school, but never practiced [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=463.1s)]
*  medicine. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  And for like 20 years after that, my mom was like, when are you going to go and actually [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  go and practice medicine? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=474.98s)]
*  I was like, mom, I'm not going to go practice medicine. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=475.98s)]
*  I'm doing my space thing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=478.92s)]
*  And, you know, for parents listening or for kids who are entrepreneurs at the beginning [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=479.92s)]
*  of their career and they're struggling with that, what's your advice? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=485.56s)]
*  How important is the education side versus if you found your purpose or passion early [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  pursuing that? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=498.56s)]
*  Well, it's a good question. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  I think in my case, I've always been so passionate. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=501.92s)]
*  I'm so curious and I'm a bibliophile. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=505.04s)]
*  I read incessantly. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  Once I get interested in something, I absorb information on it quickly. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=511.68s)]
*  Once I got interested in business, I read hundreds of business books and I asked a lot [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=514.72s)]
*  of questions. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=520.08s)]
*  I made mistakes and learned from them. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=521.08s)]
*  So if I hadn't been interested in business and I was taking classes in it, I wouldn't [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=523.0s)]
*  have absorbed nearly as much information. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=527.72s)]
*  So I think that's partly overlooked. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=530.02s)]
*  I think in addition that in this case, I really felt I didn't get the advanced degree that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=532.76s)]
*  my mother wanted me to do in particular or I didn't even graduate. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=544.72s)]
*  I mean, I have 120 hours of electives. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=548.28s)]
*  I just studied courses, classes I was interested in. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=550.36s)]
*  But here's what I believe. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=553.1600000000001s)]
*  I really believe in Joseph Campbell's The Hero's Journey. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=555.48s)]
*  I love Joseph Campbell. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=558.84s)]
*  So do I. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=560.72s)]
*  I think everyone's called to a hero's journey. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=562.1600000000001s)]
*  And most of the time, we don't answer the call because of fear. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=565.2s)]
*  Fear of failure, fear that our parents will disapprove, fear that our friends might reject [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=571.32s)]
*  us and so people play it safe in life. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=577.64s)]
*  Like I tell the story of one of my closest friends really wanted to be a writer but he [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=581.08s)]
*  was afraid he would live in an attic and fail. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  So he became a lawyer. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=588.32s)]
*  He made a lot of money. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  And he wasn't happy. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=591.56s)]
*  He didn't answer the call. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=592.92s)]
*  I think when you answer that hero's journey's call, then you're on your own path to purpose, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=593.92s)]
*  meaning. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=599.3199999999999s)]
*  And so that's what I wanted to do. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=601.04s)]
*  The hell if my mother didn't want me to do it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=603.3199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't her life. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=605.12s)]
*  She could do what she wanted to do. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  You figured that out earlier than I did. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=609.12s)]
*  I had to actually get my diploma and ship it to my parents before I figured that out. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=611.04s)]
*  But when do you think... [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=616.88s)]
*  I think that's one of the most important things that any entrepreneur can hear is when you [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=618.88s)]
*  hear that calling, go for it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  And there's some incredible elements in Campbell's work. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=628.4399999999999s)]
*  One of them I remember is like, pursue it as if a man whose hair is on fire pursues [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=634.4s)]
*  water. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=640.28s)]
*  I love that phrase. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=641.28s)]
*  You know, and there's an Indian parable. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=642.68s)]
*  You'll come across a gulch, you know, jump. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=645.12s)]
*  It's not as far as you seem as it seems. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=649.88s)]
*  Talk about answering that journey. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  Does a person actually know when they have it, when they've heard the calling? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=656.8399999999999s)]
*  I didn't know I'd had the calling for that until I looked back, until I read Joseph Campbell [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=661.16s)]
*  many years later. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=665.76s)]
*  And then I thought, hey, that's what I've been doing. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=666.76s)]
*  I've been on a hero's journey and didn't know it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=669.0799999999999s)]
*  So, but I've, in my own opinion, one of the ways you can know if you're on your hero's [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=671.44s)]
*  journey is, how much vitality do you have? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  How much passion do you have? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=679.8800000000001s)]
*  How happy are you? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  Because when you're fulfilling your purpose, every day you feel great, every day you're [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=682.48s)]
*  excited. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=687.0s)]
*  It's not that you don't fail sometimes or make mistakes. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=688.0s)]
*  There are setbacks. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=691.08s)]
*  Every hero's journey has trials and tribulations that need to be overcome or it really wouldn't [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=692.08s)]
*  be a hero's journey, right? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  You have to overcome the obstacles. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=697.6s)]
*  But it's an adventure and adventures call forth the best that we have within us to answer [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=700.08s)]
*  that call, to answer the adventure. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=706.12s)]
*  And you know you're on it because you're excited every day you get up and you just can't wait [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=708.88s)]
*  to get going. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=713.12s)]
*  Amen. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=714.12s)]
*  So I talked about having a massive transformative purpose that wakes you up in the morning, keeps [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=715.12s)]
*  you going through the day, right? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=718.52s)]
*  My favorite quote is Mark Twain who said, there are two important days in your life, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=720.8s)]
*  the day you were born, the day you found out why. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=725.24s)]
*  Did Twain originate that? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=728.72s)]
*  We quoted him in Conscious Capitalism. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=730.48s)]
*  Quoted somebody else in Conscious Capitalism. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=731.92s)]
*  But Twain was, he's older so maybe he should get credit. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=733.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's him. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=737.24s)]
*  So you know, I think measuring your own level of excitement, like are you, what are you [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=739.24s)]
*  talking about? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=744.04s)]
*  What are you reading? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=745.04s)]
*  What are you watching? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=746.04s)]
*  Where does your, where your feet take you is a way of discovering that I would assume. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=747.04s)]
*  I think so. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=751.16s)]
*  I mean, you know you're on your path when you're excited and you're full of energy [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=752.16s)]
*  and vitality and you just cannot wait to get on with it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=757.12s)]
*  Entrepreneurs, by the way, tend to be very future focused. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=760.92s)]
*  We don't spend a lot of time thinking about the past or going over our mistakes other [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=764.12s)]
*  than to say, well, I made that mistake, I'm not going to make it again. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=767.92s)]
*  We're about creating the future. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=772.0s)]
*  We're all into what we're creating. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=773.72s)]
*  You know the story quote about Picasso, someone asked Picasso once what his favorite painting [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=775.98s)]
*  was, and he said, the one I'm working on right now. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=781.36s)]
*  Yeah, my next one. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=784.52s)]
*  And that speaks for creative people, right? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=785.92s)]
*  It's not what they've done in the past. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  It's what they're doing now that gets them excited and energized. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=789.92s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=793.24s)]
*  So what's got you energized and going now? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=794.76s)]
*  So you're on your next creative journey. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  You're on your next startup. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=800.84s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=802.96s)]
*  And if you don't mind, you know, pick me up, you exit Amazon and then are you like hanging [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=804.72s)]
*  out doing nothing or did you pregnant with this idea at that same time? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=812.4s)]
*  I'd already started on this idea before I left. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=817.08s)]
*  As an entrepreneur should. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=819.6s)]
*  When I was hoping I could work out, I was hoping that, I loved Whole Foods. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=821.52s)]
*  I mean, I did it for 44 years. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=826.96s)]
*  You got pretty good at it by then. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=829.16s)]
*  I might have stayed there and I just, I thought I could bring my capital, my wisdom, my leadership [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=831.72s)]
*  to love life, but I thought I could juggle both balls. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=838.9s)]
*  What became increasingly clear is that I had in order to really, I had to let go of Whole [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=842.76s)]
*  Foods to really do love life, to get all in. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=847.76s)]
*  I was trying to be in, trying to do both and I was not doing good enough in either one. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=851.12s)]
*  So the answer was, in some ways I've been thinking about love life most of my adult [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=857.72s)]
*  life. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=863.4s)]
*  I've been excited about this idea. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=864.4s)]
*  In the book I talk about way back in 1985, we almost did a smaller version of it called [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=865.4s)]
*  Lifeworks. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=869.56s)]
*  I really believe in the human potential movement. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=871.64s)]
*  I really believe in that humans are capable of evolving and growing and becoming the best [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=876.0s)]
*  version of ourselves. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=883.48s)]
*  And that's really what love life's about, helping people become the best version of themselves. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=884.48s)]
*  So let's define it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=888.84s)]
*  And again, what I'd like to do, because you have a lot of entrepreneurs listening who [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  are in the midst of starting their companies or growing their companies, and you've had [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=894.04s)]
*  an incredible 44 year university at Whole Foods. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=898.12s)]
*  And presumably you're bringing all of your experience and learnings to this new startup. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=903.4s)]
*  So let's talk about how you did that and what you're doing there. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  So what was the seed crystal that ignited that? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=913.16s)]
*  What was the founding principle around it? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=918.92s)]
*  About for love life? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=923.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=924.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think the founding principle has been that I just believe we're on a journey, we're [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=925.72s)]
*  on a continuum, that each one of us can be healthier than we are. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=935.52s)]
*  Each one of us can be more conscious than we are. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=940.64s)]
*  Each of us can have higher degrees of emotional and spiritual intelligence. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=943.5600000000001s)]
*  We have this limitless capacity for growth. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=947.4s)]
*  And yet most people settle, they don't continue on it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=951.04s)]
*  They don't know how to. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=957.04s)]
*  But I've been growing myself my entire adult life. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=960.52s)]
*  And part of what I tried to do in the book, the whole story is talk about, with all candidness, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=963.8s)]
*  how many mistakes I made, what I didn't know when I was younger, what I've learned, how [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=969.5999999999999s)]
*  I grew, because I really wanted people. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=973.16s)]
*  And I'm still learning and I'm still growing. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=975.76s)]
*  The seed of that in some ways is this is what, like any good entrepreneur, this whole topic [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=977.72s)]
*  is something I'm very passionate about. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=983.4s)]
*  I'm very passionate about people being as healthy as they possibly can. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=985.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm very passionate about people getting more emotional intelligence, higher degrees of [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=988.6800000000001s)]
*  spiritual realizations. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=993.52s)]
*  And love life aims to do all those things. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=996.12s)]
*  On the surface, it looks like we're going to have, let's talk about the components. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=999.48s)]
*  We have a healthy restaurant. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1003.2s)]
*  We have a state-of-the-art fitness center. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1005.8399999999999s)]
*  It's a gym. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1008.3599999999999s)]
*  So we have yoga studio. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1010.0s)]
*  We have Pilates. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1012.16s)]
*  We have, we're going to do all kinds of wellness from physical therapy room to personal trainers [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1013.92s)]
*  to, we're going to do everything we can to help people to be physically healthy as possible. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1022.7199999999999s)]
*  We'll have all these recovery modalities. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1030.68s)]
*  So we have a spa. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1033.0s)]
*  So the spa will have massage and facials. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1034.08s)]
*  Not a medical spa. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1037.4s)]
*  You can't do Botox. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1038.52s)]
*  Then we have lots of recovery modalities from cold plunges to cryotherapy to red light therapy [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1041.0s)]
*  to infrared saunas to steam and regular saunas. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1049.24s)]
*  Then we have, we play, we have three pickleball courts. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1058.24s)]
*  It's big. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1062.48s)]
*  It's 45,000 square feet. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1063.0s)]
*  It used to be a best buy. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1064.0s)]
*  And this is, the multiple centers at different locations very much like a Whole Foods model. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1065.92s)]
*  That's what I hope. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1072.24s)]
*  We know real estate. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1073.04s)]
*  We know how to build a chain. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1075.08s)]
*  We know how to operate a large spread out company. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1076.52s)]
*  This is, so I'm taking all that knowledge and wisdom. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1080.52s)]
*  And I've got a lot of my old Whole Foods team working with me on it that have retired from [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1083.6000000000001s)]
*  Whole Foods and Amazon. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1088.28s)]
*  And then the most important part though, Peter, is the medical center. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1089.56s)]
*  So we're starting out with two medical doctors, nurse practitioner, and wellness coaches. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1092.44s)]
*  So the idea being, similar to some of the work that you're doing, is first we got to [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1099.28s)]
*  test people. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1103.36s)]
*  You've got to know your baseline if you're going to improve on it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1105.4s)]
*  So most people have no idea. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1108.68s)]
*  And then we have got a good app. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1110.6s)]
*  And so one of the problems most people, when they go to see a doctor and they do blood [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1112.56s)]
*  or they do some other kind of testing, it stays in the doctor's files and they lose [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1116.52s)]
*  track of it. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1121.0s)]
*  In this case, this information is going to be on our platform that they can access whenever [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1122.12s)]
*  they want. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1127.04s)]
*  They can give the doctor authority to access it and possibly their wellness coach. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1128.04s)]
*  So once we get your baseline established, then we can take them in different directions [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1132.36s)]
*  depending on what they want to do. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1137.76s)]
*  So let's say that they are an aging baby boomer like I am. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1139.36s)]
*  I'm going to be interested in our longevity program. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1142.24s)]
*  I want to extend my health span and my life span. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1144.9199999999998s)]
*  If you ask people, would you like to live to be 100? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1148.48s)]
*  Most people say, no, I don't think so. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1152.12s)]
*  Because they think of somebody as 100 as being like with dementia and not. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1155.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1161.52s)]
*  I usually ask them, do you want to live to 150? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1162.52s)]
*  And they say no. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1163.52s)]
*  But how old do you want to live, John? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1166.52s)]
*  I want to live as long as I possibly can. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1169.9199999999998s)]
*  While maintaining a high degree of mental and physical wellness. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1175.76s)]
*  So I'm not going to put it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1181.8799999999999s)]
*  I believe in the singularity that we're gaining longevity. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1184.4s)]
*  So it's possible that I'll spend all eternity at age 100. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1187.76s)]
*  You and I are the same page there. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1192.36s)]
*  I used to set a goal, a ridiculous goal of 700 years because I had heard that sea turtles [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1195.72s)]
*  could live that long. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1202.0s)]
*  And then people, of course, dismiss it as laughable and such. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1204.08s)]
*  But a lot of people say I want to live to 100, 120, 150. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1208.0s)]
*  And the realization was what I really want to do is live till what I call longevity escape [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1212.32s)]
*  velocity. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1216.96s)]
*  Live to that point where you can live as long as science is continuing to extend your health [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1217.96s)]
*  span. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's an exciting time. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1224.9199999999998s)]
*  I think this is one of the most exciting times to be in this, I don't call it a business. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1226.96s)]
*  I don't call it into this in this domain. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1233.8s)]
*  And it's the greatest gift you can give anybody, right? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1235.56s)]
*  I mean, health is the new wealth. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1238.6s)]
*  I agree. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1240.6s)]
*  And it's something people take for granted. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1241.6s)]
*  And it's unfortunate. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1244.1599999999999s)]
*  And partly, I think they take it for granted because a lot of people don't think they can [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1246.72s)]
*  do anything about it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1250.86s)]
*  And they're not willing to put in the extra work. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1252.82s)]
*  Everybody's got sort of like, oh, my dad and my granddad died at this age. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1255.84s)]
*  So that's how long I have. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1260.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think that's just a false premise. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1262.6599999999999s)]
*  And it is. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1265.02s)]
*  And that you can modify that. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1266.6999999999998s)]
*  OK, so you've been cooking this for a while. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1269.58s)]
*  It's been a passion play for some time. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1273.54s)]
*  But there was a point at which you transitioned. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1277.58s)]
*  Was it when you to focus on that? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1279.5s)]
*  And this was after you exited Amazon? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1281.9799999999998s)]
*  Yes? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1284.3799999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1285.3799999999999s)]
*  That's when I really... [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1286.3799999999999s)]
*  I was focused on it before then, but that's when I really went all in. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1287.3799999999999s)]
*  Are you playing the CEO role here in this one? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1290.7s)]
*  I am the CEO. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1292.78s)]
*  All right, good. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1293.78s)]
*  That's good to know. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1294.78s)]
*  And by the way, I think anybody who's an entrepreneur and a baby boomer, I mean, I'm on my 25th [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1295.78s)]
*  or 26th company and I plan to keep going for the next 50 years. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1303.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I love building businesses. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1307.22s)]
*  It's a creative art form. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1310.5800000000002s)]
*  What's more fun than that? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1312.26s)]
*  I haven't found it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1313.26s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1314.26s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1315.26s)]
*  And by the way, entrepreneurs are the individuals who find and solve problems and ultimately [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1316.26s)]
*  make the world a better place. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1320.58s)]
*  And I think I know your philosophy because I heard it in my audiobook. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1322.1s)]
*  By the way, I enjoyed the whole story as an audiobook. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1326.9399999999998s)]
*  So for those who are reading audiobooks, definitely a fantastic... [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1331.3799999999999s)]
*  My only regret on the audiobook, Peter, is I only read the prologue when I was on that [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1336.62s)]
*  LSD trip. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1341.62s)]
*  And I wish I'd read the whole thing, but I didn't. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1342.62s)]
*  And we'll call that a minor regret. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1344.58s)]
*  By the way, I found that a same experience. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1346.78s)]
*  I didn't read my first book, Abundance, and then when I listened to it, I was like, oh, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1349.7s)]
*  I don't like the author's voice, the reader's voice. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1353.22s)]
*  And so I've read my book since then. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1356.02s)]
*  And your next one, you should read it yourself. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1360.18s)]
*  It's not bad. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1362.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I like your voice better, but the other person who reads the book is an excellent... [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1363.8200000000002s)]
*  The professional reader, Adam Barr, he could do one thing I couldn't do. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1369.0600000000002s)]
*  Because as you know, it reads kind of like a novel and we have a lot of dialogue in it. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1372.94s)]
*  He got the other voices, the accents down in a way I never could have done that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1377.46s)]
*  So that's the one plus for having him do the reading. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1381.7s)]
*  For sure. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1385.3s)]
*  For sure. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1386.3s)]
*  Real quick, I've been getting the most unusual compliments lately on my skin. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1387.3s)]
*  Truth is, I use a lotion every morning and every night religiously called One Skin. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1391.7s)]
*  It was developed by four PhD women who determined a 10 amino acid sequence that is a syndolytic [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1396.9s)]
*  that kills senile cells in your skin. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1403.96s)]
*  This literally reverses the age of your skin and I think it's one of the most incredible [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1407.62s)]
*  products I use it all the time. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1411.82s)]
*  If you're interested, check out the show notes. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1414.94s)]
*  I've asked my team to link to it below. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1416.66s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the episode. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1418.46s)]
*  So you took the CEO role and that's great. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1421.3s)]
*  And I think by the way, one of the best longevity therapeutics in the world is being an entrepreneur [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1425.74s)]
*  and being a CEO and having those challenges and having to learn and having to get up and [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1432.02s)]
*  having that passion every day, right? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1436.16s)]
*  I mean, that's what keeps you young. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1438.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because you're basically telling your body, hey, you can't get old because I have [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1440.16s)]
*  this purpose I have to fulfill so you got to stay with me, baby. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1445.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1449.5600000000002s)]
*  If you ever want and I tell people who use the word retirement, it's a four-letter word, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1450.5600000000002s)]
*  I Google the correlation between retirement and death. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
*  It's way too high. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1458.88s)]
*  It's like an average like five years after retirement you die so just don't ever retire. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1460.0800000000002s)]
*  Did you co-found it? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1466.48s)]
*  Did you bring it? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1467.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1468.8s)]
*  You brought in? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1469.8s)]
*  So talk about that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1470.8s)]
*  Who'd you bring in? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1471.8s)]
*  Oh, I co-founded it with some of my Whole Foods Markets executive team. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1472.8s)]
*  So Walter Robb, who was my co-CEO for seven years and president before then as a co-founder [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1475.88s)]
*  as is Betsy Foster. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1482.44s)]
*  She was a senior executive at Whole Foods for a long time. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1484.2s)]
*  And then I have, those are the three designated co-founders because I started everything with [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1487.28s)]
*  them. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1491.68s)]
*  But I have other executives at Whole Foods that were there at the beginning. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1492.76s)]
*  Glenda Flanagan, who was my long-term chief financial officer. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1495.44s)]
*  A.C. Gallo, who was president. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1498.96s)]
*  And Jim Sutter did real estate. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1502.08s)]
*  So I kind of got the old gang back together. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1504.08s)]
*  I made them an offer they couldn't refuse. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1507.32s)]
*  I gave them, I said, I know you don't want to work like you used to work so I'm going [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1508.76s)]
*  to pay you this much per hour and you just work whenever you want to. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1513.32s)]
*  And then secondly, I gave them a lot of stock options so that if it hits, they'll get a [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1517.72s)]
*  good payday. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1522.24s)]
*  How do you think about choosing a co-founder? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1523.24s)]
*  So that's a story I'm asked often, okay? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1526.16s)]
*  Should I have a co-founder when I start my company? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1528.68s)]
*  What should be their attributes? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1531.28s)]
*  And I have a philosophy about it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1533.4s)]
*  I'd love to hear yours. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1534.52s)]
*  Well, I don't think about it quite the way most people do. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1535.52s)]
*  For me, the co-founders, I mean, I always felt like I'm the visionary. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1538.72s)]
*  It's my ideas that are being actualized. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1545.08s)]
*  I just feel like I can share that co-founder title. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1547.24s)]
*  It makes a big difference to people. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1551.24s)]
*  When they have that title, they have more commitment and more passion in the business. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1554.2s)]
*  And so I feel like I can be somewhat generous with it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1559.16s)]
*  By the way, that's a really good point. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1563.6s)]
*  Psychologically someone who feels, you know, they're not going to say I'm the SVP of this [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1565.96s)]
*  or the director of that, but if they say I'm a co-founder with John Mackey or whomever, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1570.72s)]
*  psychologically, it's a lot more responsibility and you care more about it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1577.24s)]
*  And it costs you nothing to get the co-founder role away. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1581.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1585.0400000000002s)]
*  It costs nothing but increases commitment and morale tremendously. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1586.0400000000002s)]
*  And you know, my mental image, and tell me if it's yours, is the people that you start [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1591.28s)]
*  this with, you're going to spend more time with them than you do other members of your [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1598.92s)]
*  family or your other close friends because it is a, you're jumping in the deep end and [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1603.92s)]
*  it's a 24-7 experience. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1609.2s)]
*  So I assume people that you like and like to hang out with is important. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1612.4s)]
*  It is. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1617.5200000000002s)]
*  I mean, one of the reasons I stayed so long at Whole Foods for 44 years was I was doing [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1618.5200000000002s)]
*  it with people that we shared the setbacks and the failures and we shared the triumphs [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1625.46s)]
*  and the gains. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1631.5400000000002s)]
*  That creates a sort of bonding that maybe like a marine has when they go into combat [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1632.86s)]
*  together, they bond with their fellow marines. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1636.94s)]
*  And of course, we're not actually killing people or it's not life and death. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1639.42s)]
*  However, there's some intense times you go through. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1644.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, have you ever heard the saying that there are two emotions that all entrepreneurs [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1646.62s)]
*  have at one time or another which is complete ecstasy and utter terror? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1651.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1658.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1659.54s)]
*  For sure. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1660.54s)]
*  For sure. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1661.54s)]
*  And it's true. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1662.54s)]
*  I mean, as soon as things get comfortable, you stretch yourself to the point of like, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1663.54s)]
*  you know, breaking and as soon as things get, anyway, it's just a constant oscillation, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1670.26s)]
*  hopefully up and to the right on the way. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1675.82s)]
*  And you tell the story in the whole story about the 100-year flood that took out your [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1678.3s)]
*  massive store. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1686.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, talk about just overcoming disaster. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1688.02s)]
*  I mean, you think you've made it, everything's going amazing and then nature comes at you. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1692.46s)]
*  So Peter, one of the reasons I actually, I'm so glad I wrote the whole story because as [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1700.18s)]
*  an entrepreneur who's very future-oriented, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1704.7s)]
*  the past. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1708.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1709.22s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1710.22s)]
*  I almost recommend everybody write a memoir because looking backwards, you start to see [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1711.22s)]
*  threads continue through your life. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1717.06s)]
*  I didn't even make the LifeWorks love life connection until I started working on the [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1719.1s)]
*  book. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1724.02s)]
*  And I thought, oh my God, this is LifeWorks. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1725.02s)]
*  I'm bringing it into actualization 39 years later after I abandoned the idea. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1726.7s)]
*  And so looking backwards, you begin to see things, you see patterns, you see things you [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1732.62s)]
*  didn't see before and it's a gift that you give to your children and your grandchildren [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1739.54s)]
*  and other descendants. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1743.06s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1744.06s)]
*  And honestly, you recognize your own resilience. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1745.74s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly correct. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1749.54s)]
*  Thank you for bringing me back to the topic. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1753.74s)]
*  That's one of the things I recognized. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1755.22s)]
*  Oh my God, I had all of the, I had four coattempts, I had the flood, I had all of these big challenges [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1756.82s)]
*  that went on and I managed to survive all of them. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1764.98s)]
*  And I know even in doing some podcasts, people would ask me, it's like, well, how do you [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1769.06s)]
*  do that? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1772.4199999999998s)]
*  And I thought, well, I guess I just have a lot of resilience. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1773.46s)]
*  I'm not a quitter. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1776.66s)]
*  It's like a setback is not a, a setback is an opportunity to think about, okay, I've [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1777.98s)]
*  made a mistake here. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1783.18s)]
*  What is the lesson here that I can learn? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1784.66s)]
*  How can I be better going forward? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1786.54s)]
*  How can I avoid this in the future? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1788.22s)]
*  So I actually reframed any kind of setback as an opportunity to make me better and grow. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1790.22s)]
*  So important, right? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1797.02s)]
*  Not easily discouraged. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1798.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think one of the lessons is if you don't love what you're doing, if it's not [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1800.62s)]
*  your highest calling, if you're not on a hero's journey, then you're going to give up when [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1805.8999999999999s)]
*  you hit those bumps. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1810.62s)]
*  Wow, good point. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1811.62s)]
*  I never thought about that before. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1812.62s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1814.4199999999998s)]
*  The times, you know, another, you know, learning I've had a few times in my life, just I think [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1816.06s)]
*  twice, I went after something because I thought it was a get rich quick scheme. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1822.3799999999999s)]
*  Good opportunity. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1826.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1827.58s)]
*  And it was the closer I start investing time, investing time, and the closer it got, the [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1829.1399999999999s)]
*  more I realized this is not easy. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1834.1s)]
*  This is hard. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1835.86s)]
*  And I don't care about it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1837.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1838.02s)]
*  I'm going to quit. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1839.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1840.02s)]
*  And so everything looks easy from a distance. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1841.02s)]
*  And unless you love it, when you, you know, and when you get into and close and building, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1843.8999999999999s)]
*  you're going to give up. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1850.1s)]
*  And so it really needs to be your highest calling, your massive transformative purpose, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1851.22s)]
*  your hero's journey, whatever it is. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1854.62s)]
*  And if it's not, find what that is and go do that. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1856.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1861.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1862.14s)]
*  You know, that's a takeaway for me from our conversation. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1863.14s)]
*  I'm not going to forget that. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1865.5800000000002s)]
*  That's a very important insight. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1866.5800000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1867.5800000000002s)]
*  Thank you, pal. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1868.5800000000002s)]
*  So take me back to, so you pick your co-founders, you have a general idea. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1869.5800000000002s)]
*  What do you do next? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1875.78s)]
*  I really want to dissect this for entrepreneurs wanting to learn from you. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1876.78s)]
*  Did you go heads down writing a business plan? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1882.5400000000002s)]
*  Did you start pitching it around? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1885.66s)]
*  How did you start putting meat on the bones and making this real? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1887.5s)]
*  Well, I did write a business plan. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1892.02s)]
*  How important is a business plan? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1895.66s)]
*  A business plan is valuable because it helps you think through the business in a more systemic [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1897.5800000000002s)]
*  way. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1904.8200000000002s)]
*  And you have to answer the important questions. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1906.6200000000001s)]
*  Entrepreneurs have a tendency to be a little bit flippant. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1909.18s)]
*  It's like, I don't worry about that shit. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1911.6000000000001s)]
*  You already am. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1913.5800000000002s)]
*  Yes, we'll deal with it when we get there. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1914.74s)]
*  And while sometimes that's very, very healthy and you need that kind of energy to do a startup, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1917.3s)]
*  you also need the people that are more careful thinking about what about this and what about [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1922.02s)]
*  that? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1927.5s)]
*  You just can't blow it all off or your dream may crater before you've actually gotten. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1928.5s)]
*  It's like, Elon Musk might have, take SpaceX, he might have a vision about rockets but you [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1934.1s)]
*  know what? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1938.86s)]
*  I've seen a lot of people on the team that lessen the chance of the rockets blowing up, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1939.86s)]
*  although Elon always gets excited when a rocket blows up because it's like, great, we're not [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1945.74s)]
*  going to do that again. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1950.4199999999998s)]
*  But that's expensive. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1951.4199999999998s)]
*  We learned something. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1952.4199999999998s)]
*  It's expensive to blow up rockets. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1953.4199999999998s)]
*  You don't want to do it just as a matter of course. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1955.5s)]
*  Similarly, I think that the business plan does help us think through the business in [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1958.62s)]
*  a more detailed way. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1962.9799999999998s)]
*  I own about 60% of Love Life. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1964.78s)]
*  I put in 60% of the capital and friends and family and acquaintances have put in the other [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1966.66s)]
*  40% at this point. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1972.3400000000001s)]
*  I've got more dry powder. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1974.14s)]
*  So let's talk about that. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1977.74s)]
*  You could have funded the whole thing yourself but you brought, you allowed others to invest. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1978.74s)]
*  How important is that for someone as an entrepreneur? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1984.5400000000002s)]
*  So that's such a great question because there's a lot of different ways to answer that question. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1988.22s)]
*  So one of the things that I learned from doing Whole Foods was, I said in the book [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=1993.94s)]
*  that when we did our IPO 14 years, we started Safer Way in 78 and IPO to Whole Foods in [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2000.02s)]
*  early 1992. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2006.06s)]
*  So 14 years. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2007.46s)]
*  In those 14 years, no one ever got a nickel back for their investment in the company. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2009.02s)]
*  And by going public, I felt like, you know what, everybody that believed in me and believed [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2013.6200000000001s)]
*  in our dream, they're getting, they can stay in now if they want to or they can take a [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2017.66s)]
*  massive payday and most just sold some stock, kind of got their ante out you might say, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2023.3s)]
*  but then realized much bigger gains down the road. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2028.62s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2031.1s)]
*  Well, I think it's just by letting other people invest, two interesting things happen. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2032.1s)]
*  One is I feel an obligation to them. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2037.18s)]
*  It's like, can't let this thing fail. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2039.54s)]
*  It's one thing for my own money to fail but now I have friends and people who believe [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2041.4s)]
*  in me again, who want me to deliver. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2045.5s)]
*  And so, that's going to get a better effort out of me, honestly. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2048.66s)]
*  Let me double click on that because that is, you know, sometimes you are forced to persist. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2052.46s)]
*  Sometimes you persist because it's your highest calling and because it's intrinsic drivers. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2062.42s)]
*  But sometimes there's a safety line that keeps you going. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2068.78s)]
*  Like I don't want to lose my mom or dad's money or my friend's money and you push even [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2071.98s)]
*  harder. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2076.7000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, you know, every one of my ventures that I consider a success was an [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2079.14s)]
*  overnight success after 11 years of hard work and dozens of near-death experiences. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2085.02s)]
*  And you would never have gotten there had you given up. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2090.94s)]
*  There's so many times it was easy to give up. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2094.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God, I can't go forward. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2096.62s)]
*  But that, I don't want to call it guilt, but that sense of obligation is just another motivator [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2098.7s)]
*  to have you focus. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2105.5s)]
*  It's all about focus and energy and passion, right? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2107.5s)]
*  There's a second other reason is that by letting my friends invest, not only the first thing [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2112.38s)]
*  that I now feel like I can't let them down, but when the business is financially successful, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2120.22s)]
*  I don't want them come to me and saying, why the hell didn't you let me in on this deal? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2126.02s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2131.5s)]
*  I like that. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2132.5s)]
*  So you capitalized it initially, 60-40, that's great. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2134.26s)]
*  Talk about hiring. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2143.0600000000004s)]
*  What have you learned about hiring? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2144.9s)]
*  Who are your first hires? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2146.42s)]
*  How do you think about hiring? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2148.6200000000003s)]
*  How many people do you have on board now? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2150.5400000000004s)]
*  Well, one thing I'm going to tell you about hiring, I'm not very good at it. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2153.6600000000003s)]
*  That's not one of my superpowers. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2159.38s)]
*  And so what I've learned, and I'll tell you why, because it comes into having one of my [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2161.42s)]
*  superpowers, I really believe in people. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2165.38s)]
*  I see the best in people. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2167.7400000000002s)]
*  I see their potential. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2169.1800000000003s)]
*  Now that's good because people don't want to let me down because John believes in me [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2171.2200000000003s)]
*  and they really want to give me their very best effort. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2175.02s)]
*  But on the other hand, I oftentimes don't see the shadow side in them. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2177.9s)]
*  I don't see the self-destructive. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2181.14s)]
*  So I somewhat have learned to count on other people. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2184.38s)]
*  One of the things I learned at Whole Foods, we did a lot of group interviews and I would [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2187.62s)]
*  say you can always bullshit one person, but it's hard to bullshit a whole group because [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2191.1s)]
*  other people look at it from different perspectives. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2196.66s)]
*  So knowing that I'm not that great at hiring, I tend not to make important hiring decisions [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2199.34s)]
*  without having other people that I think are very good at that in the room with me and [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2204.7s)]
*  we talk about it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2210.7s)]
*  So that's the thing I'll say about that. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2212.82s)]
*  But I just got off a Zoom interview for a hire. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2215.06s)]
*  It's interesting to think about, can you hire someone on Zoom? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2220.06s)]
*  The in-person queues are so much richer. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2225.22s)]
*  I think you have to ultimately meet the person. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2229.1s)]
*  But I don't trust myself like you on a one-on-one interview. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2233.66s)]
*  So what I've started to do is have at least two other people on the Zoom with me. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2238.34s)]
*  And then after the three of us have a conversation, how did we feel? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2244.22s)]
*  I know a friend of mine who used to be Chief Product Officer at Amazon talked about, I [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2249.14s)]
*  don't know if it's true when you were there, that Amazon had something called a bar raiser. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2256.1s)]
*  So in the hiring function, there were individuals in the organization who represented the best [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2261.46s)]
*  in the organization. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2268.02s)]
*  And so those individuals were nominated as bar raisers. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2269.58s)]
*  There had to be one bar raiser in every interview decision. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2275.18s)]
*  And they had the ability to nix somebody against everybody else. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2282.06s)]
*  In the words, you're trying to, it's the notion that A players hire A players and B players [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2286.3399999999997s)]
*  hire C players. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2295.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Steve Jobs said that. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2296.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's true, the very best. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2299.98s)]
*  So who were the first hires you started going after here? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2305.02s)]
*  What kind of positions? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2308.62s)]
*  The first people I hired were all the Whole Foods people. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2309.62s)]
*  And then suddenly Love Life's done a few acquisitions. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2313.38s)]
*  So we bought a restaurant in Miami. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2315.62s)]
*  So where are you opening up first, by the way? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2320.54s)]
*  In LA. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2323.62s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2324.62s)]
*  So right near me, we're in LA. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2325.62s)]
*  El Segundo. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2327.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2328.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2329.62s)]
*  Our grand opening, Peter, is going to be on August 10th. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2330.62s)]
*  We're actually open now, but it's a soft opening. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2333.24s)]
*  We haven't publicized it. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2337.7599999999998s)]
*  We just open our doors because that way we can work. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2338.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a complex business model. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2342.2799999999997s)]
*  And I didn't even get all the way done with the medical, by the way. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2344.2s)]
*  I'm looking forward to learning more because I'm in the business a little bit. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2347.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2350.4799999999996s)]
*  How we play together. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2351.4799999999996s)]
*  Can I buy you a coffee when you come to town? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2352.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I'll be there coming out on the 9th. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2353.9599999999996s)]
*  I'll buy you coffee at my place. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2356.9599999999996s)]
*  I'll give you a tour. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2358.72s)]
*  But I'll be there. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2360.3199999999997s)]
*  I come on the 9th and I'll be there through the 11th, that weekend, basically. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2362.36s)]
*  I was just there for a couple of weeks. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2366.76s)]
*  I came back last Friday. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2368.28s)]
*  Oh, congrats. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2369.84s)]
*  So anyway, soft opening to work out the books. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2371.44s)]
*  On that medical thing, to just finish that, what we were talking about before. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2374.1600000000003s)]
*  So one path would be a longevity path for physical health. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2378.0s)]
*  Secondly, if we do the work and we find out, or people may already know it, if people need [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2383.96s)]
*  to reverse, one of the things our medical system does a very poor job of is actually [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2389.2599999999998s)]
*  curing people. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2393.4599999999996s)]
*  The diseases that kill people today are chronic diseases. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2395.7s)]
*  So heart disease has been the leading killer since about 1900. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2400.5s)]
*  The infectious diseases, COVID being a notable but temporary exception, an outlier, for things [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2403.66s)]
*  like pneumonia and influenza and things like that, that were leading killers 100 years [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2411.7599999999998s)]
*  ago, are way, way down in terms of the number of people that die from them. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2417.38s)]
*  So you've got heart disease first, you've got cancer second. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2421.86s)]
*  Ironically, you've got doctors are the third leading cause of death. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2425.6200000000003s)]
*  It is so sad. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2431.46s)]
*  Exactly, iatric, exactly. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2433.46s)]
*  But then you've got stroke, you've got type 2 diabetes, and it takes a while before you [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2437.6600000000003s)]
*  get down to any kind of infectious disease. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2442.5s)]
*  So these are lifestyle dietary diseases that are killing people. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2444.9s)]
*  So the first thing is, is if people have a chronic disease like obesity, like type 2 [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2448.02s)]
*  diabetes, like heart disease, and like most autoimmune diseases, we can help them reverse [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2453.9s)]
*  those diseases. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2459.36s)]
*  So healing people is one of the functions, or one of the paths people can go down. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2460.96s)]
*  Thirdly, we're going to appeal to young people that we're going to call a maximum performers. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2465.86s)]
*  We can take people on a journey to get their maximum, to do the burn, to get absolutely [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2472.42s)]
*  as fit as they can, their VO2 max, to do the personal trainer, to do the serious weight [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2479.02s)]
*  stuff and endurance, and really get them as fit and healthy as possible. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2486.06s)]
*  And then we have a concierge program so that people can be all in. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2490.54s)]
*  So those are the way they can do in the medical. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2494.66s)]
*  The doctors are trained in functional medicine, integrative medicine, and lifestyle medicine. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2497.14s)]
*  So they can do primary health care. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2503.1s)]
*  But the whole idea, their primary job is going to be to help people whichever path they want [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2506.2599999999998s)]
*  to go down and help support them. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2512.0s)]
*  We're starting with two doctors, and hopefully we'll grow to more fairly quickly, but we [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2513.66s)]
*  have two to start. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2517.46s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2519.2599999999998s)]
*  Ten years from now in success, how many love life centers are there on the planet? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2521.94s)]
*  You know, it's funny, people always ask me the ten-year question, and I always try, I [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2528.58s)]
*  always quote back Yogi Berra, which is, it's very difficult to make predictions, especially [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2533.46s)]
*  about the future. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2540.3s)]
*  You've heard that one before. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2541.3s)]
*  But here's the thing, I get asked that question by journalists all the time about, you know, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2542.9s)]
*  what's the world going to be like in ten years? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2547.58s)]
*  And I say, well, it's really hard to say because if you go back, you know, ten or fifteen years [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2549.74s)]
*  ago, people weren't using smartphones. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2553.74s)]
*  We didn't know about AI. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2557.46s)]
*  If you go back twenty years ago, the internet was just getting going. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2558.46s)]
*  We didn't really have, most people weren't online. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2561.58s)]
*  And they were there on AOL, you know, dial-up, modems. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2564.18s)]
*  So new things are always emerging, right? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2567.66s)]
*  AI is the latest big thing to emerge, and it's, you know, the whole, it just came into [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2570.54s)]
*  people's consciousness a few years ago. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2574.2599999999998s)]
*  So the thing that's underrated by people is new emergence. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2576.68s)]
*  New emergence is always occurring. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2580.3999999999996s)]
*  And so when you make a prediction about the future, you're predicting a static world without [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2583.16s)]
*  the changes. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2587.8399999999997s)]
*  But the reality is, I don't think we'll have that many units ten years from now, Peter, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2588.96s)]
*  because A, we have to learn, we're going to have to be in dialogue with our members about [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2593.16s)]
*  what works and what doesn't work. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2599.6s)]
*  Secondly, finding real estate is difficult. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2601.56s)]
*  It takes a long time to find a great location, and then you have to build it out. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2603.72s)]
*  You design it and build it out, and that takes a while. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2607.68s)]
*  So I'll go out on the limb and say something like ten years from now, we'll have ten to [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2610.18s)]
*  fifteen units. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2615.32s)]
*  But twenty years from now, we'll have a hundred. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2616.32s)]
*  Nice. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2619.08s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2620.08s)]
*  And of course, you're into exponential growth. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2621.08s)]
*  I am. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2623.52s)]
*  And so am I. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2624.52s)]
*  And so the exponential part kicks in once you get, once you really, don't scale a business [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2625.52s)]
*  model that doesn't work. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2632.48s)]
*  Get your business model down first, then begin to grow it. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2635.0s)]
*  And then once you take in, once you really have it, you take in a massive group and you [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2638.52s)]
*  proven it, you take in large amounts of capital and you exponentially grow it as quickly as [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2641.98s)]
*  you can. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2647.0s)]
*  I love that. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2648.0s)]
*  And that's really important, right? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2649.0s)]
*  And by the way, you lay that out beautifully in the book, right? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2650.52s)]
*  You were sort of experimenting and trying and churning. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2656.32s)]
*  And then finally, you know, when Whole Foods Market hit, you were able to grow. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2661.2000000000003s)]
*  How many stores in the final result were there? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2667.7400000000002s)]
*  There is no final result, but when I left, there were 540 when I retired. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2670.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2676.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2677.2400000000002s)]
*  One of the things I think a lot about, and I write about this in my book, is that I call [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2680.08s)]
*  the six D's of exponentials. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2684.36s)]
*  I don't know if you've encountered them, right? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2685.92s)]
*  When you digitize something in the early days, it's deceptively slow. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2688.2400000000002s)]
*  Then you dematerialize, demonetize, democratize, and then it disrupts things. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2692.6400000000003s)]
*  So one of the questions, of course, I think about in my longevity companies and businesses, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2698.6800000000003s)]
*  how do you fully dematerialize and digitize this? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2705.32s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, that's where you get real, true exponential growth. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2709.4s)]
*  There are some things that, you know, bricks and mortar and physical elements are important. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2715.1200000000003s)]
*  Let me point out a couple of things to you to complete it. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2719.6800000000003s)]
*  I agree with what you said, but here's what I've learned that contradicts a little bit [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2722.96s)]
*  what you're saying for scaling what you want to do. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2728.36s)]
*  Most people can't change very easily. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2733.28s)]
*  Most people need handholding. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2736.04s)]
*  Most people need a community. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2738.52s)]
*  There's a reason why AA has been more effective than most other therapies for addictions because [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2740.36s)]
*  you have a community of support. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2745.92s)]
*  It's very difficult for people to change the way they eat. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2748.12s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2751.04s)]
*  Habits do not change easily. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2752.32s)]
*  You have all these enablers of bad habits called your family and your friends. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2755.4s)]
*  It's been my experience, like we had a program in Whole Foods. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2761.04s)]
*  By the way, this was one of the things that triggered me to do this. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2763.68s)]
*  Let me go back. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2766.6s)]
*  I just thought of it. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2767.6s)]
*  Well, we started something at Whole Foods about 15 years ago. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2768.6s)]
*  We called the total health immersion. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2774.0s)]
*  And so we're self-insured. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2776.48s)]
*  So we're paying all the healthcare costs. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2778.36s)]
*  There might be a reinsurer that kicks in, you know, above a million dollars or something [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2780.96s)]
*  like that, but in general, we're paying it all. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2785.4s)]
*  And so, and what we discovered was about 10% of our team members would spend 90% of our [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2788.4s)]
*  healthcare dollars. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2794.12s)]
*  So if you target the 10, some of that can't be helped. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2795.68s)]
*  Somebody does get automobile accident or a motorcycle accident, has a premature birth [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2798.48s)]
*  or maybe gets cancer by that time it's too late. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2802.7999999999997s)]
*  And you can't do anything about those. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2806.72s)]
*  However, the chronic diseases like heart disease, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, exactly, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2808.8799999999997s)]
*  these things are all targetable. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2815.08s)]
*  And so what we did was we created a total health immersion. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2817.52s)]
*  We did for a year around different places around the country. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2820.96s)]
*  We had to sign up for it. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2824.16s)]
*  It's free to the team members. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2827.12s)]
*  We pay all their costs. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2829.04s)]
*  And increasingly, we started paying for their spouse to come as well because without the [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2830.52s)]
*  spouse, meaningful change wouldn't occur. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2834.2799999999997s)]
*  And so we did that. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2836.92s)]
*  And you know what I discovered? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2839.56s)]
*  That if people would, even within one week, the human body is so resilient, if people [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2841.24s)]
*  will just change their diet and eat real Whole Foods for a week, all their biometrics begin [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2846.3599999999997s)]
*  to decline. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2853.16s)]
*  The cholesterol begins to go down. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2854.16s)]
*  Their blood pressure begins to go down. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2855.6s)]
*  They start feeling better. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2857.64s)]
*  And so and then if they stay on the program and we saw so many people lose over a hundred [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2860.2799999999997s)]
*  pounds in a year or less. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2865.2s)]
*  But here's what happens. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2868.24s)]
*  Recidivism is high if you don't have a community of support. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2870.0s)]
*  It's all about your community. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2873.24s)]
*  It's all about and habits don't change unless you've got the reinforcement mechanisms around [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2875.44s)]
*  you. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2880.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2881.64s)]
*  I cannot scale Love Life the way you could scale a purely digital business. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2883.12s)]
*  However, in the long run, well actually, we'll create the communities that you're going to [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2889.3199999999997s)]
*  send people to that want to stay. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2895.52s)]
*  So what's your price point going to be at Love Life? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2897.64s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you that because I can't find out your price point without talking [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2900.92s)]
*  to a salesperson. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2904.64s)]
*  I'll tell you my price point. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2906.4s)]
*  But it's a different level, right? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2908.56s)]
*  Do you have MRIs and CTs and DEXA scans and all of that in your medical facility? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2911.2s)]
*  Are you going that deep? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2915.9199999999996s)]
*  We have a DEXA scan. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2917.7999999999997s)]
*  We don't have an MRI machine at this first one. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2919.9199999999996s)]
*  But we can contract out for some of those services. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2922.8399999999997s)]
*  But we're going to do the reflabotomish. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2926.2s)]
*  We're doing our blood draws. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2927.2s)]
*  So we're not going to go quite as deep as you do, but pretty deep. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2929.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean the genetics is pretty powerful as a learning tool. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2932.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think we're going to end up as partners versus competitors. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2937.3999999999996s)]
*  I love that. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2941.08s)]
*  I believe in the win-win-win relationships. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2943.2799999999997s)]
*  I know you do, as do I. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2945.7999999999997s)]
*  Because the reality is so at Fountain, people come and do a full body upload, right? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2949.04s)]
*  We digitize you 150 gigabytes of data. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2955.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a full body MRI brain, brain vasculature, coronary CT with AI overlay for soft plaque, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2958.72s)]
*  low dose lung CT, a DEXA scan, genomics, metabolomics, everything possible. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2966.04s)]
*  To answer a question, is there anything going on inside you you need to know about right [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2971.1200000000003s)]
*  now and what's likely to happen to you and how do we prevent that? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2974.44s)]
*  All of that's great. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2977.76s)]
*  You get a concierge medical team to follow you through the year. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2978.76s)]
*  But what you're doing as well is the meat and potatoes, the fundamental elements, right? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2982.2400000000002s)]
*  It's what I do for myself in terms of food, diet, exercise, sleep. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2990.84s)]
*  All of those things are the most important things to be doing right now. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=2997.84s)]
*  Yes, but knowledge is not enough. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3002.34s)]
*  Yes, knowledge is not enough. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3005.84s)]
*  Support structure around you is critical. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3007.84s)]
*  That's what I learned from Total Health Immersions is that the people that had a good support [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3009.84s)]
*  structure stayed with it, never looked back, changed their lives forever. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3015.06s)]
*  Most people didn't have the support structure. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3019.66s)]
*  They had their food addictions, particularly if they're trying to overcome obesity. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3021.8199999999997s)]
*  They didn't get obese the first day they were born. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3025.3799999999997s)]
*  They ate their way to it and they got food addictions. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3028.42s)]
*  People are underestimating how powerful food addictions are. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3031.2999999999997s)]
*  It's very hard for most people to quit and change it. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3033.7799999999997s)]
*  They need support. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3037.06s)]
*  They do. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3038.06s)]
*  And so, for example, I run after my abundance 360 program and after my platinum longevity [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3039.06s)]
*  trips, I run a 22 day no sugar fast on a WhatsApp group and people are in a community [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3046.18s)]
*  digitally for 22 days just to give them power over their sugar addiction, which is a hugely [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3055.22s)]
*  powerful addiction. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3061.48s)]
*  But I can imagine having a physical location and a coach and a community around you is [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3063.48s)]
*  even that much more. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3069.7s)]
*  So we do a few things online right now, just to tell you what we're doing online. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3071.3999999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3074.94s)]
*  We acquired two businesses. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3076.1s)]
*  So we now have a telehealth business called Love Life Telehealth. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3078.0s)]
*  And we're licensed in all 50 states to practice medicine. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3081.5s)]
*  I think in 2023 we did business in 47 of the states, plus a lot of foreign countries. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3085.66s)]
*  So we have that digital reach. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3091.76s)]
*  And I think as we grow our brand that the telehealth business will grow. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3094.14s)]
*  That might even scale faster as we get the branding out there. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3099.42s)]
*  Sure. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3102.62s)]
*  We have an online coaching business for diabetes and weight loss, type 2 diabetes and weight [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3103.66s)]
*  loss called Mastering Diabetes and Mastering Weight Loss. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3108.2999999999997s)]
*  We acquired that business from a couple of entrepreneurs that I know that wrote a great [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3111.8199999999997s)]
*  book called Mastering Diabetes. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3115.7799999999997s)]
*  And I see us opening up online coaching businesses for heart disease, for autoimmune diseases, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3117.7s)]
*  for cancer, for a variety of different things. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3124.62s)]
*  And they get medical attention. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3127.54s)]
*  And if we will be flying people in to or having people fly in for seminars and things like [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3130.38s)]
*  that, then once we, you do the same thing, you send people to fountain life gatherings [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3137.34s)]
*  from longevity and whatnot. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3143.62s)]
*  And then they have the relationship with the doctors on an ongoing basis. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3145.7400000000002s)]
*  We see doing something similar to that. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3150.6600000000003s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3152.7400000000002s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3156.22s)]
*  love. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3161.2599999999998s)]
*  The company is called Fountain Life. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3162.2599999999998s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3163.2599999999998s)]
*  physicians. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3168.5s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3169.5s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3173.7799999999997s)]
*  Until that day when you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3175.62s)]
*  room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3179.62s)]
*  four going on. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3183.94s)]
*  And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3185.34s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3188.1000000000004s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3191.6000000000004s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3195.1800000000003s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3200.6400000000003s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3205.42s)]
*  for soft plaque, dexa scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive blood workup. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3212.26s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3218.86s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3222.3s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3229.0s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3232.1000000000004s)]
*  You might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3233.3s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3236.34s)]

*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3291.42s)]
*  Talk about what your biggest challenges or concerns were getting going in this business. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3294.02s)]
*  So you're entering as a seasoned entrepreneur slash CEO. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3298.86s)]
*  You've got the capital, which a lot of entrepreneurs don't necessarily have at the beginning. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3305.1s)]
*  But what were you, where were any doubts or what were your challenges? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3309.86s)]
*  What are your challenges? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3314.86s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, we'll know a lot more to answer that question about a year [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3315.86s)]
*  from now. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3321.5s)]
*  Going into it, I think the biggest challenge is when do most people go see a doctor? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3322.66s)]
*  When it's too late. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3328.1s)]
*  Exactly, when they're sick. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3329.62s)]
*  So we're trying to change that by having a, the whole idea of the doctor is to see the [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3331.34s)]
*  doctor so you don't have to see a doctor, right? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3335.5s)]
*  That the doctor's job is to not give you drugs to manage symptoms, but to help you never [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3338.62s)]
*  get these chronic diseases in the first place. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3344.26s)]
*  But that's a disruption. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3347.66s)]
*  That's a different way of thinking about it. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3349.38s)]
*  How many times, if I had a dollar for every time people ask me, will insurance cover what [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3351.7799999999997s)]
*  you're doing? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3355.58s)]
*  Will it cover the membership? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3356.58s)]
*  And the answer is no, it will not cover the membership. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3357.58s)]
*  I mean, it won't cover the, if you go see a chiropractor, maybe insurance will cover [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3359.62s)]
*  some of that. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3363.8799999999997s)]
*  But so much medical that's preventative or helping people to avoid diseases is not covered. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3364.8799999999997s)]
*  Because the pharmaceutical and medical device and the hospital industries are, those are [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3373.66s)]
*  the gargantuan businesses that, that, that regulatory capture, they're setting the rules [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3379.3s)]
*  in a lot of ways. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3384.7400000000002s)]
*  So insurance will not cover it. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3385.98s)]
*  And that's a change in thinking. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3387.34s)]
*  They can get a super bill and some of the testing will be covered, but we're not going [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3389.1000000000004s)]
*  to be taking their insurance and trying to get, collect payments. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3393.86s)]
*  That's different. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3397.98s)]
*  That's what I'm concerned about more than anything else. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3398.98s)]
*  You know, I... [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3401.26s)]
*  Any advice there? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3403.0600000000004s)]
*  Well, I think people need, I mean, people need to realize it is the cheapest money they're [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3404.22s)]
*  going to spend. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3409.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3410.14s)]
*  And it's, and it's, you're going to spend the money eventually, right? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3411.14s)]
*  And you're going to find out about your sickness eventually. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3415.34s)]
*  When do you want to know? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3418.5s)]
*  You know, I think those, those are the, those are the bullets for me that are, are, are [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3419.5s)]
*  critical. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3426.46s)]
*  The numbers in the U.S. are dismal in terms of current health care systems, right? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3427.5s)]
*  It's just insane. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3434.38s)]
*  Peter, do you know about this company that started up in Sweden by the founder of Spotify, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3435.38s)]
*  Daniel Eck? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3444.7400000000002s)]
*  It does, it's a full body scan that's, that, that's similar to what you're doing, but it's [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3445.7400000000002s)]
*  very inexpensive. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3450.9s)]
*  And they're, they're, they got three in Stockholm and they're opening another one up in London. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3451.9s)]
*  I think maybe it opened already this summer. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3457.18s)]
*  I'm going to try to go get a scan there myself. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3460.18s)]
*  Next time I'm in Europe in October, I'm going to go to London and get a scan there. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3464.42s)]
*  Because I've talked to those guys and I mean, they, I think they charge, I think they get [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3469.46s)]
*  the complete scan, they do a blood test, they give all the results back to you within the [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3473.94s)]
*  hour that you're there and then you meet with a doctor for 30 minutes to go over your results. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3479.94s)]
*  I think the total cost is like $750, which is peanuts. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3485.4199999999996s)]
*  I have seen, I have seen that and it's, you know, the question becomes ultimately, I know [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3489.4199999999996s)]
*  the numbers on, on all of these areas. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3495.3399999999997s)]
*  So I'm having a hard time, you know, even the CapEx expense on the MRI machine and the [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3500.02s)]
*  doctor, sure you can get, you can get lower price per the hour doctor, but it's going [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3506.8599999999997s)]
*  to be interesting to see if you actually, when you decipher it, how real is it for [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3511.98s)]
*  a US marketplace? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3517.46s)]
*  Well, I talked to those guys and it was pretty interesting that they have a very high, people [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3519.46s)]
*  sign up. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3527.7400000000002s)]
*  It's, they got a, they got a three year waiting list in Stockholm. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3528.7400000000002s)]
*  So it's probably worth checking it out a little bit. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3532.2200000000003s)]
*  I thought those guys were interesting when I talked to them. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3536.5s)]
*  What fears do you have right now in getting going? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3540.34s)]
*  I mean, an entrepreneur is got vision, but is always sort of really aware of the, of [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3544.2200000000003s)]
*  the challenges and the unknown areas. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3555.78s)]
*  How do you think about that for yourself? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3560.46s)]
*  Well, I think one of the challenges we've got is if you think of every, every blessing [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3562.38s)]
*  has a shadow side to it. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3568.38s)]
*  And the fact that I have a lot of capital and I've been able to invest it, that's a [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3570.46s)]
*  good thing. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3575.06s)]
*  The shadow side is people are not as frugal as they should be with capital. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3576.06s)]
*  If you're a scrapping startup like we were in the early days of Whole Foods where every [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3581.38s)]
*  dollar is precious, you don't waste it. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3584.6600000000003s)]
*  And I feel like, I've got my team, which is kind of seasoned executives at Whole Foods, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3587.58s)]
*  but they're used to spending more money. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3594.78s)]
*  So they're not as frugal as a startup should be. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3597.22s)]
*  That's one of our challenges. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3600.06s)]
*  I think that's really an important insight. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3601.06s)]
*  I've had a few companies. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3603.8199999999997s)]
*  I had one company. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3605.18s)]
*  I won't mention the name of it. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3606.18s)]
*  I came in as a co-founder and vice chairman. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3608.62s)]
*  Someone else took on the role of CEO who was a great scientist, but not a great CEO and [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3613.1s)]
*  plowed through cash. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3620.7s)]
*  And was able to raise money on my reputation, his reputation. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3623.1s)]
*  And there's a point at which when you have too much money, you buy solutions versus innovating [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3627.62s)]
*  solutions. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3636.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3637.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3638.98s)]
*  I hadn't thought about that, but that's true. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3639.98s)]
*  Or you look for the easy path. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3641.2599999999998s)]
*  But mostly it's a state of mind. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3642.7799999999997s)]
*  It's an attitude. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3644.42s)]
*  And I'm a little worried that love life is not scrappy enough. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3645.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3651.82s)]
*  But I intend to change that. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3653.82s)]
*  Well, I'm sure you can. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3656.82s)]
*  I'm sure you will. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3659.82s)]
*  How do you think about marketing in an organization? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3662.82s)]
*  How do you think about sort of creating a brand? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3664.82s)]
*  I mean, that was an interesting journey you went through in naming Whole Foods and in [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3669.82s)]
*  building a meaningful brand. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3676.42s)]
*  How important is that for an entrepreneurial CEO to be thinking about? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3680.06s)]
*  It's extremely important because all the great brands, think about any great brand, they [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3684.94s)]
*  didn't build it through advertising. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3689.7s)]
*  Brands are built through two things. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3692.58s)]
*  One, you have to have, they're built by word of mouth, by very, very satisfied customers [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3694.62s)]
*  who go spread it. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3701.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3703.2999999999997s)]
*  That's first. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3704.2999999999997s)]
*  And secondly, they're built by good public relations. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3705.2999999999997s)]
*  In other words, PR builds brands. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3708.74s)]
*  Advertising comes along later when you no longer have an interesting story, advertising [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3711.54s)]
*  comes along to support the brand. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3715.5s)]
*  But the brand itself is going to be built through excited, you want customers that are [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3718.3399999999997s)]
*  your biggest marketers because they tell everybody about it. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3723.58s)]
*  You need rabid fanatical fans. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3726.7799999999997s)]
*  In other words, a really good brand is a cult. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3728.9s)]
*  Look at Apple, people line up at the Apple stores when they're going to issue a new iPhone [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3732.18s)]
*  because they want to get the latest iPhone. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3736.94s)]
*  That's what you want your brand to have, fanatical advocates for your brand that love you, that [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3738.98s)]
*  love what you're doing, believe in your mission, that are aligned with you. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3744.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3747.42s)]
*  Look at the Harley-Davidson. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3748.42s)]
*  What a, you know, I mean, that's a great brand. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3749.42s)]
*  That's an iconic brand that was built. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3753.58s)]
*  And then, you know, I mean, how often do you see television commercials for Harley-Davidson? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3756.58s)]
*  They don't need to. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3759.98s)]
*  They do, they do other, they promote in other ways. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3760.98s)]
*  John, in this day of digital employment, of, you know, virtual offices, where do you come [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3764.78s)]
*  out on that? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3774.7400000000002s)]
*  Do you find, do you miss the days of having everybody in the same office and the energy [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3776.5400000000004s)]
*  of being co-located and working? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3780.34s)]
*  Or have you allowed Love Life to go fully virtualized? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3783.46s)]
*  No. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3788.0600000000004s)]
*  No, I mean, when you read my book, that was my ultimate, it led my departure from Amazon [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3789.14s)]
*  a big fight about that because I wanted to bring people back to my office and Amazon [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3794.9s)]
*  said it was too early and we had a big argument about it and that sort of was the catalyst [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3799.2999999999997s)]
*  for my departure. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3804.58s)]
*  But it's got pros and cons, right? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3805.82s)]
*  It's wonderful that people can stay connected wherever they are. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3810.5s)]
*  That's just so wonderful. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3815.82s)]
*  That's something we haven't had before. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3817.06s)]
*  But I don't think you can build a really healthy culture strictly from remote. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3819.14s)]
*  People do not have the same kind of commitment. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3824.34s)]
*  They're not all in. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3826.94s)]
*  That's been my experience. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3830.86s)]
*  So I think the hybrid model is the way to go. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3832.3s)]
*  You have to figure out a way to bring the band together frequently for the relationships [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3835.46s)]
*  to be established and nurtured and grown. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3840.22s)]
*  Trust, you know, you were talking about you didn't like to hire just from a Zoom interview [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3844.42s)]
*  because you can't get all the cues. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3849.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, all those cues are important for building trust. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3850.94s)]
*  I mean, how can you tell somebody has integrity or not if you don't work with them and see [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3854.3s)]
*  them on a day-to-day basis? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3858.94s)]
*  The things they might say at a meeting or in lunch or just when you pop by the office [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3860.98s)]
*  and you're talking, all of that stuff is instrumental for building relations and there's no substitute for it. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3866.26s)]
*  Did you go out to venture markets for this first financing or did you keep it with friends [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3872.58s)]
*  and family and... [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3877.3s)]
*  Yeah, but some of my friends are in the venture business, so I did get a little bit of venture [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3878.3s)]
*  money, but I did not send out that business plan. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3883.06s)]
*  What's your advice for entrepreneurs on, you know, where to get their early capital? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3886.02s)]
*  I just did a whole course on fund your purpose and I'm opinionated about this. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3893.66s)]
*  So am I. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3900.02s)]
*  In my book, I talk about the VCs. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3901.02s)]
*  I have a whole chapter on the VCs. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3903.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3904.4599999999996s)]
*  And they are, I call them hitchhikers with credit cards. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3905.4599999999996s)]
*  As long as you help them get to where they want to get to, they will help pay for the [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3909.66s)]
*  gas. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3913.8199999999997s)]
*  But if you wander off and you're not following the path, they will try to hijack the car, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3914.8199999999997s)]
*  hire a new driver, generally from Harvard or Wharton or Stanford and throw you out on [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3921.2999999999997s)]
*  the side of the road. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3925.7s)]
*  So I think my advice always to entrepreneurs is the exact opposite of what the VCs tell [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3927.34s)]
*  them, which is just grow sales. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3935.38s)]
*  Don't worry about your investments. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3938.78s)]
*  They're all trying to exponentially grow. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3941.42s)]
*  And that's because that's very much in the VC. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3943.86s)]
*  They've got their seven-year window for their money and they live on a blockbuster model. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3947.46s)]
*  If you get a hit, that can pay for all your failures. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3953.74s)]
*  So they're willing to tolerate a high failure rate in order to get... [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3958.8399999999997s)]
*  So I think they try to scale these companies too quickly and the entrepreneurs lose control [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3963.8199999999997s)]
*  of it. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3968.18s)]
*  They bring in professional management. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3969.9399999999996s)]
*  Then they do cram down rounds. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3972.3799999999997s)]
*  I just find the VCs to be... [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3974.2999999999997s)]
*  I always tell the entrepreneur, these guys may seem like they really like you. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3976.8199999999997s)]
*  Just remember, they have their own agenda and it's not aligned with you. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3980.7s)]
*  You have a longer term agenda than they do. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3985.54s)]
*  You love what you're building. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3988.2999999999997s)]
*  It's your mission. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3989.46s)]
*  It's your purpose in life. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3990.46s)]
*  It's everything for you. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3991.46s)]
*  So I generally urge them, pick their VCs carefully. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3992.52s)]
*  As I learned the hard way, all money is not the same color. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=3995.94s)]
*  And pick your VCs. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4000.8599999999997s)]
*  Make sure they're aligned with your strategy. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4002.06s)]
*  And if they're not, then don't take their money because they're going to try to change [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4005.02s)]
*  your business. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4009.78s)]
*  You will regret it. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4011.02s)]
*  I've had one time, particularly in my life, where I took someone's money because it was [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4012.02s)]
*  easy, but we had a different philosophy in life. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4018.1800000000003s)]
*  And it came to haunt me terribly. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4025.1000000000004s)]
*  I had to buy them out at the end in order for the company to continue to progress. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4026.86s)]
*  So Bezos famously in the earliest days of the company was just focused on top line [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4033.62s)]
*  revenue and not profits. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4041.2999999999997s)]
*  And it was like his famous investor letter that said, listen, I'm planning to grow this [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4043.02s)]
*  as rapidly as possible, profit to be damned. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4050.02s)]
*  And if you don't like it, go invest someplace else. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4053.22s)]
*  Summarization of the letter. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4055.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4056.7799999999997s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4057.7799999999997s)]
*  What do you think about growing revenues over profits versus some of the most extraordinary [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4059.34s)]
*  loving experiences that I've had in business is actually building a profitable company [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4066.38s)]
*  from the beginning? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4072.42s)]
*  What's your philosophy on those two? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4075.02s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4076.02s)]
*  Well, I think that Jeff kind of made it acceptable for businesses to do that, right? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4077.26s)]
*  Because he proved the naysayers wrong. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4083.6800000000003s)]
*  There was a lot of Amazon skeptics out there. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4087.04s)]
*  But Jeff kept growing the business and he was so evangelical and he was such a bright [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4089.68s)]
*  guy that he was able to sell the market on it. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4097.4800000000005s)]
*  At least enough in the market that believed it. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4100.12s)]
*  And guess what? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4102.0s)]
*  And he delivered at the end of the day, right? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4103.0s)]
*  He created a profitable business. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4104.88s)]
*  He turned the knobs. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4106.2s)]
*  Once you have enough customers and enough volume and enough everything. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4107.2s)]
*  That's true. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4112.56s)]
*  If you Facebook, you can monetize at some point, right? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4114.4400000000005s)]
*  So Twitter X, similar thing. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4118.320000000001s)]
*  So bricks and mortar, not so easily to do that. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4121.68s)]
*  You have to have a business model that works and relatively quickly. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4125.52s)]
*  So talk to me. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4132.400000000001s)]
*  I remember reading in the book, right? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4135.04s)]
*  You were clearly monitoring getting to profitability as soon as possible on a per store basis. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4138.48s)]
*  Is that still how you're thinking about it? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4145.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4147.639999999999s)]
*  Well, for one thing, so our strategy is to make this first unit successful. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4148.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, I want to get as much members as possible because you're fixed overhead in the store. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4156.48s)]
*  It's 45,000 square feet. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4161.2s)]
*  Your rent, your utilities, the labor that we have to pay for is all very high. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4162.679999999999s)]
*  So if you don't have the sales, then that's the end of the story. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4167.32s)]
*  So this is a high fixed expense business. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4173.36s)]
*  The variable expenses are there with labor but relatively not not. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4176.719999999999s)]
*  They also will scale as you grow sales. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4184.0s)]
*  So if we can grow sales, then the bottom line will partly take care of itself. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4186.16s)]
*  So I do think we have to grow sales as rapidly as possible once we really get our launch [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4191.86s)]
*  underway after August 10th. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4196.0s)]
*  And then after we do that, if we build a successful model, then it's going to be easy for us to [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4198.08s)]
*  raise money at favorable terms. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4202.68s)]
*  I will raise money from venture capitalists in the next go around. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4204.2s)]
*  Although another thing I might tell the I learned this the hard way that I'll tell other [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4208.4800000000005s)]
*  entrepreneurs is start your company from the very beginning with class B shares that have [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4212.68s)]
*  10 to 1 voting rights. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4217.16s)]
*  At the end of the day, the VCs are just hitchhikers. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4219.6s)]
*  They're not going to stay for the long ride. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4222.4400000000005s)]
*  I love that line, hitchhikers with credit cards. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4223.8s)]
*  So true. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4225.84s)]
*  Well, so we started Love Life with all the founding money that came in has been at the [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4226.84s)]
*  10 to 1 voting shares. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4233.12s)]
*  But when we go out, raise our public round, after we've proven our business model works, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4235.04s)]
*  it'll be they'll have class A shares with just one vote per share. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4240.52s)]
*  It is nice that you have the capital to tell someone to hitchhike if they don't like it. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4246.12s)]
*  I have a lot of fuck you money. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4250.76s)]
*  It's true. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4252.28s)]
*  It's great. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4253.28s)]
*  That is exactly the right term for it. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4254.92s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, John, I knew Bezos from college. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4257.88s)]
*  I had started I was in MIT and started something called Students for Exploration and Development [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4262.92s)]
*  Space and grew it from this was my first entrepreneurial experience in my fraternity as a sophomore. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4267.679999999999s)]
*  I start this college group at MIT and then I write some letters and I hit a nerve and [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4274.759999999999s)]
*  all of a sudden we have 100 chapters around the world. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4280.7s)]
*  And Jeff was the president of the Princeton chapter. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4283.88s)]
*  So I knew him as a space cadet during my college years. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4287.04s)]
*  Where were you? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4289.76s)]
*  I was in MIT. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4290.76s)]
*  MIT. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4291.76s)]
*  So you're that's not too far from Princeton. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4292.76s)]
*  But it was you know, this was pre internet. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4295.04s)]
*  So all the communications are over mail, right? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4296.900000000001s)]
*  And we have a conference annual conference in Washington, DC. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4299.34s)]
*  And so I did not see him until God knows a couple of decades later in the in the mid late [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4304.0s)]
*  90s. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4311.72s)]
*  After Amazon has started. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4312.84s)]
*  And so I have a coffee with him at a coffee shop. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4315.04s)]
*  And like, Jeff, what what's up with this Amazon business? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4320.12s)]
*  I thought you wanted to do space. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4325.72s)]
*  And he goes, I'm going to do this first, make the money and then go spend it in space. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4327.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4332.12s)]
*  But you know, what's interesting about Bezos in this example, though, Peter, is that he [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4333.12s)]
*  goes against type as an entrepreneur, right? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4338.240000000001s)]
*  He's not he's not like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates or Michael Dell or Elon Musk that start [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4341.2s)]
*  he started later. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4347.0s)]
*  He was on Wall Street. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4348.28s)]
*  He was in the financial markets. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4349.28s)]
*  And but he has an entrepreneurial temperament, I can tell you that. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4351.6s)]
*  So but he didn't probably start Amazon until he was in his 30s, right? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4355.84s)]
*  Early 30s. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4359.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4360.44s)]
*  So that's that's a little bit unusual. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4361.44s)]
*  It is. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4363.96s)]
*  But I just want to be clear. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4364.96s)]
*  I think you can be an entrepreneur at any age. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4366.2s)]
*  It is. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4369.2s)]
*  Because entrepreneurs usually can't wait. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4370.44s)]
*  True, true. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4372.44s)]
*  I mean, but there is OK, listen, I'm on my 26th act. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4373.44s)]
*  I think you're on some variation of I'm on act two. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4378.4s)]
*  I think your act one had a lot of sub acts in it. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4383.5199999999995s)]
*  But nonetheless, it was it was just it was interesting. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4385.8s)]
*  I won't go into it. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4391.88s)]
*  I keep on every time I see Jeff, I nudge him about why Blue Origin, the space company is [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4394.16s)]
*  hasn't launched to orbit yet. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4399.48s)]
*  I think that's that's the source. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4401.48s)]
*  He's got that rivalry with Elon. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4403.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God, he does. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4404.96s)]
*  And I think part of it is he's not running it. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4406.08s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4411.5199999999995s)]
*  I think he is, you know, he's funding it, but he's not running it. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4412.5199999999995s)]
*  The funny thing about Elon is how many businesses can that guy run as a CEO? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4415.2s)]
*  He's he's he's he's disrupting the way we think about one pointed focus. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4419.24s)]
*  He's able to juggle a lot of different businesses. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4426.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, it's crazy. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4429.04s)]
*  I was a point I remember in 2008. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4430.44s)]
*  He was on my board at the X Prize Foundation, and it was great. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4433.0s)]
*  He funded an X Prize for us early on in global learning. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4437.0s)]
*  And he since funded a hundred million dollar prize for carbon extraction [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4440.04s)]
*  from the atmosphere and oceans, which has been going great. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4443.92s)]
*  But I got a call from one day saying, Peter, I really I apologize. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4446.56s)]
*  I have to I have to step off the board. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4450.68s)]
*  I've got to focus on SpaceX and Tesla. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4452.28s)]
*  And so I'm stepping off of everything. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4455.32s)]
*  And of course, every he did that for like a year. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4456.92s)]
*  And now he's got a twenty seven [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4459.56s)]
*  direct different directions with all that he's doing. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4460.8s)]
*  And thank God. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4463.84s)]
*  I mean, putting the politics aside, the guy is pushing innovation [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4464.76s)]
*  at a speed and an audacity that is unparalleled by anybody. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4469.96s)]
*  I think Elon Musk is most important person alive. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4475.12s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4477.84s)]
*  He's you know what he needs, Peter, he needs to either [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4480.36s)]
*  he needs to hook up with one of our companies [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4484.4s)]

*  Oh, I've had this conversation with him a number of times, and I've said, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4488.4s)]
*  listen, I will treat you at Fountain like, please let me, you know. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4491.599999999999s)]
*  And we keep on teasing each other on on I'll call it Twitter because I, you know, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4495.679999999999s)]
*  that I say sugar is a poison. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4502.32s)]

*  Well, you know, it's interesting is his brother, Kimball. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4508.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's in the whole field. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4511.679999999999s)]

*  And I think he's probably the most healthy influence [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4526.48s)]
*  Elon has in his life is probably his brother. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4531.16s)]

*  And I've had long dinner conversations about this as well. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4538.72s)]
*  He said people think they want to be me, but they don't want to be me. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4543.76s)]
*  They they want. Yes, exactly. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4548.400000000001s)]

*  Said the only place I could go is like a biker bar when no one recognizes me. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4560.64s)]
*  But that was five years ago. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4564.280000000001s)]
*  I think everybody would recognize him. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4565.6s)]
*  I mean, he showed up at this restaurant [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4567.400000000001s)]
*  I was eating at a couple of years ago and because I was having dinner with Luke Nosik, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4571.240000000001s)]
*  which was one of the people, you know, Luke and [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4575.6s)]
*  Elon just walks in and joins us. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4579.84s)]
*  And I said, well, this is fantastic. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4582.52s)]
*  You know, where where you're you can still move about the world without bodyguards. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4584.320000000001s)]

*  I got all kinds of bodyguards out there. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4591.56s)]
*  They're just not in here in this in this private dining area. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4593.12s)]
*  But they're guarding the entrances and watching out for me. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4596.16s)]
*  So you're right. I would hate. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4599.04s)]
*  I still have the freedom to move around this world and not with enough anonymity where I'm free. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4600.72s)]
*  I wouldn't train that. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4607.5599999999995s)]

*  But God Almighty would not want what Elon has or Jeff. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4617.84s)]
*  You know, when we were when we met with Jeff Paisos and his team to talk [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4622.44s)]

*  I desperately hope I never have to get to. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4638.839999999999s)]

*  your experience with psychedelic journeys. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4761.120000000001s)]
*  And I really enjoyed the transparency that you had there. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4765.6s)]
*  And equally transparent, I've had really it's been in the last five years, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4772.400000000001s)]
*  some of the most extraordinary experiences in in my life. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4777.280000000001s)]
*  As you describe it, you know, in dissolving the ego and and being connected [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4780.68s)]
*  with the oneness of the universe and love being the most powerful experience. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4786.16s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4792.48s)]
*  And I wish I had experienced it earlier in my life. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4794.44s)]
*  Would you mind recounting a little bit of what you've done and what it's been, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4797.76s)]
*  what it's meant for you? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4800.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, I talk about psychedelics three separate times in the book. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4802.2s)]
*  I start out with it because I'm 22. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4806.08s)]
*  I just turned 22 and I took I'm in Austin. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4808.92s)]
*  Summer had a birthday just a couple of weeks before. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4813.24s)]
*  And I took a I took a dose of LSD. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4815.84s)]
*  I'd done I'd taken LSD several times before. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4818.4800000000005s)]
*  I did it by myself. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4821.04s)]
*  But of course, back in the day, I had no idea how strong the dose was. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4822.400000000001s)]
*  This was the most powerful dose I'd ever taken or half taken since it was. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4826.200000000001s)]
*  It was like I describe it as it was so overwhelming [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4831.0s)]
*  that you had no choice but to let go. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4835.92s)]
*  I mean, I tried to I tried to hold on to that ego. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4838.76s)]
*  But it was like it's like being on Niagara Falls, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4841.84s)]
*  holding on with one hand to a rock. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4844.84s)]
*  Eventually, you get tired and you get swept over the falls. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4846.88s)]
*  And then I it's only retrospect. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4849.8s)]
*  I describe it as an ego death or ego dissolving [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4852.8s)]
*  simply because there was no separation any longer. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4855.8s)]
*  There was just pure being there was. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4858.4800000000005s)]
*  And that that felt timeless. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4860.8s)]
*  I don't for all practical purposes, it probably measured in this reality. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4862.76s)]
*  It was measured by how much that how long the LSD before, you know, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4867.76s)]
*  started to decline in my system, before my liver started detoxifying it. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4871.36s)]
*  And but but psychologically, it seemed to be endless. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4875.639999999999s)]
*  And it was amazing and it was ecstatic. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4879.08s)]
*  And so that changed the direct trajectory of my life, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4882.24s)]
*  because it was soon after that, I moved into this vegetarian co-op. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4885.5599999999995s)]
*  I wasn't a vegetarian. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4889.08s)]
*  I just want I wanted I was interested in I was a seeker. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4890.84s)]
*  I was a searcher. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4894.759999999999s)]
*  And I wanted to get on with the adventure of my life. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4895.84s)]
*  That was what I woke up to. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4900.36s)]
*  I answered the hero's journey after that. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4901.719999999999s)]
*  That that that woke me up to it. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4904.2s)]
*  So that's the first time I talk about it. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4906.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And and you do it in a very beautiful fashion where you [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4908.24s)]
*  it took you through this this increasing intensity to a place [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4913.679999999999s)]
*  of fear initially. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4919.679999999999s)]
*  Yes. And then extraordinary connection and and blissful connection with the universe. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4921.12s)]
*  We're very attached to our egos. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4927.5599999999995s)]
*  We don't. Oh, my God. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4928.88s)]
*  Very attached to our egos. We don't want to let them go. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4929.84s)]
*  So my my my my journey of most profound and my mom listens to my podcast. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4932.12s)]
*  So hi, mom. Yes, I'm talking about this right now. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4937.64s)]
*  Was when I did a DMT journey. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4943.36s)]
*  Yes, I've done DMT as well. I didn't talk about it in the book. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4946.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And instantaneous, right? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4949.04s)]
*  Instantaneous. So it is. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4950.96s)]
*  But the most profound I've had you are in DMT is, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4954.04s)]
*  you know, it's been called the God molecule. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4958.5199999999995s)]
*  It's released by the pineal gland. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4960.679999999999s)]
*  It is thought to be a molecule released at birth and at death. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4962.76s)]
*  And in that moment and also, just to be clear, mom, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4971.04s)]
*  there's no downside physical medical effects. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4975.44s)]
*  It's it's it's been done. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4978.28s)]
*  I've done it with a shaman and with a physician on those occasions. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4979.76s)]
*  And it is it's called the entrepreneurs psychedelic [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4984.52s)]
*  because you're in and out of the experience in under 30 minutes. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4988.76s)]
*  Yeah. Right. 20 minutes sometimes. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4992.160000000001s)]
*  But it's a complete instant dissolution. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4994.64s)]
*  Your ego is gone. And it was extraordinary. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=4997.4800000000005s)]
*  Can I share you one of my one of the images I had during that? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5002.280000000001s)]
*  Of course. So this was probably on the third occasion of doing it. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5005.8s)]
*  I'm coming out of this blissful, loving experience, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5011.8s)]
*  and I see this ocean of energy and it's an infinite ocean of energy, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5016.56s)]
*  bubbling energy, almost like a quantum foam. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5021.6s)]
*  And coming out of the out of that ocean, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5025.52s)]
*  almost a single plane of energy are these two double helices that go up [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5028.92s)]
*  and then come back down. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5033.56s)]
*  And I was like, oh, my God, that's that's that is like, you know, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5035.72s)]
*  we we emerge out of the oneness of the universe into life. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5040.64s)]
*  And then we we come back into it at the end. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5044.64s)]
*  And it was like the most profound experience. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5047.4800000000005s)]
*  I still can visually remember that. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5049.72s)]
*  And it gives me goosebumps thinking about it. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5053.04s)]
*  So in that experience that I have in LSD, I experienced the [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5055.200000000001s)]
*  I experienced the Big Bang. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5062.64s)]
*  Yeah. We're in the singularity. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5064.92s)]
*  We're in this singularity. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5066.400000000001s)]
*  And it and it was the Big Bang was just a giant orgasm of self-love, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5068.04s)]
*  self-singularity exploding out, forming all the multiverses. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5074.8s)]
*  And and and then there's the breathing back in. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5079.6s)]
*  It comes back into the singularity. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5084.08s)]
*  This is the infinite game. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5085.92s)]
*  It goes on forever and ever and ever and ever and ever. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5087.64s)]
*  And every every creative possibilities realized [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5090.24s)]
*  were constantly an infinite game, infinite play. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5093.08s)]
*  So I experienced this on this journey. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5096.36s)]
*  And that's when I realized after that, it's like I am [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5098.56s)]
*  I'm an I'm part of all it is. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5103.8s)]
*  I not the ego, but the essence of me is immortal. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5105.8s)]
*  And so is everything else. Right. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5109.48s)]
*  And so there's nothing to be afraid of. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5111.84s)]
*  Not death, not life. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5114.2s)]
*  And that's when the hero's journey call came. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5116.52s)]
*  And it was like, I am on a grand adventure. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5119.4s)]
*  I even symbolized it by hitchhiking. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5122.76s)]
*  What? I'm open for the adventure now. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5124.64s)]
*  I'm going to create this amazing life for myself. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5127.84s)]
*  You know, I had a complete loss of fear of death [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5130.64s)]
*  coming out of that [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5135.320000000001s)]
*  because of the, you know, the connection with infinity. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5137.320000000001s)]
*  You know, listen, I want to live as long as I can. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5142.52s)]
*  I want to live as long as I can. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5144.400000000001s)]
*  And what is it's a good life. It's an amazing life. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5146.12s)]
*  It's like the most exciting time ever to be alive. Right. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5148.360000000001s)]
*  The only time more than that is maybe tomorrow. But [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5150.6s)]
*  but yeah, it was an incredible experience. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5154.0s)]
*  I have not had that level on. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5157.44s)]
*  I have tried LSD once, but it was not in the same reflective. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5160.32s)]
*  Right. You know, I've not in the right context. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5166.36s)]
*  Only wanted to do this inside of a of a spiritual journey [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5169.04s)]
*  where it's not for play. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5174.68s)]
*  This is for self-reflection. Self-realization. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5176.2s)]
*  How what's your advice to. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5180.4800000000005s)]
*  Entrepreneurs or or individuals [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5184.68s)]
*  who haven't experienced this yet? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5188.6s)]
*  I don't know if you want to give it advice. Well, so. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5191.96s)]
*  So I'll just say two other times to talk about in the book. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5197.84s)]
*  I'll get to the second. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5201.08s)]
*  Yeah. So I first time I did MDMA was 1985. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5202.52s)]
*  It was legal and. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5206.52s)]
*  And that was a tremendous had a big impact on me. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5208.839999999999s)]
*  Changed my life because I absolutely knew [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5212.28s)]
*  without a doubt and I've never forgotten it, that love was the most important thing. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5216.24s)]
*  We are here to love. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5220.24s)]
*  We are here to love and to share love and connect with people and spread love. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5222.24s)]
*  That is that is what we're here to do. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5227.32s)]
*  That was the connective fiber of the universe. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5229.599999999999s)]
*  Yes, the universe is built on love. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5232.44s)]
*  And we're but we're we're trapped in the ego to a certain extent. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5234.839999999999s)]
*  And the ego is fear and resistance and a belief in separation. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5238.04s)]
*  So I experienced that. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5242.32s)]
*  And then after that, I began my spiritual journey in earnest. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5243.84s)]
*  I started to meditate regularly. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5247.16s)]
*  I started to do breathwork regularly. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5250.24s)]
*  I started studying the Course of Miracles. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5252.8s)]
*  I really launched on my own spiritual path with a more disciplined focus. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5254.84s)]
*  And then the last time I talk about it in the book is towards the end of the book. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5260.44s)]
*  When I'm about to I'm going to leave Whole Foods Market. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5263.96s)]
*  And I've been so motivated by Michael Pollan's book, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5266.48s)]
*  How to Change Your Mind. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5271.84s)]
*  Yes. And Michael's oftentimes he did it with the On The Worst Dilemma. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5273.12s)]
*  He's just he's he's right on the cusp of these things becoming more cultural. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5276.679999999999s)]
*  You mainstream and he helps orchestrate that cultural change in [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5281.16s)]
*  because after I read him doing a guided journey, I thought, you know what? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5284.84s)]
*  I'm going to do a guided journey. Absolutely. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5288.08s)]
*  And I set that up so that just a couple of months before I retired from Whole Foods, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5289.92s)]
*  I would do I did a five day retreat. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5295.4s)]
*  I remember five five day one on one where your your guide would not let you escape early. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5297.88s)]
*  You were like, believe in the process. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5305.12s)]
*  Believe, trust the process, trust the process. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5307.5199999999995s)]
*  And that was a combination of breathwork, which I did five separate times. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5310.4s)]
*  I got actually more out of the breathwork. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5315.4s)]
*  I just kind of encouraged people enough. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5317.6s)]
*  We're going to do breathwork at Lifeworks. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5320.4s)]
*  When I talked a lot about Lifeworks on the physical health side, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5321.96s)]
*  but we're going to be doing we want to really help people emotionally and spiritually as well. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5326.24s)]
*  So we'll be doing breathwork. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5330.4800000000005s)]
*  We'll be doing meditation classes. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5331.96s)]
*  We will bring in speakers. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5334.04s)]
*  I really want to help people on this part of their lives. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5335.52s)]
*  And when psychedelic therapy is legal in California, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5337.92s)]
*  like it is now in Oregon and Colorado, we're going to want to do that there. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5340.72s)]
*  I do think that should be legal for therapeutic reasons. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5345.44s)]
*  So anyway, that guided journey was huge for me because, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5348.48s)]
*  A, I was able to let go of some anger I had towards Amazon. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5353.0s)]
*  I was able to heal on that and let it go because it's the negative emotions that block love. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5356.72s)]
*  Anger, fear, guilt, envy. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5363.2s)]
*  These things prevent us from being aware of love as presence. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5368.0s)]
*  And so as we practice forgiveness and we let those negative [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5372.4s)]
*  emotions go, we come into the love's presence more clearly. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5377.04s)]
*  So that was very important for my healing. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5381.2s)]
*  And it also let me let go of Whole Foods. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5383.16s)]
*  I saw that it was time that my hero's journey was calling me in a different direction now [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5385.64s)]
*  and that this was the right thing to do. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5389.8s)]
*  I'd already made the decision, but I got really clear in my heart. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5391.36s)]
*  My soul told me, yes, you're on your path. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5395.48s)]
*  This is the right thing. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5397.84s)]
*  So it was and you're asking me, what do I recommend it? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5399.4s)]
*  I absolutely, 100% recommend a guided spiritual journey under a good therapist [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5402.36s)]
*  who's there, creates a set and setting matter. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5408.84s)]
*  A safe place where you're totally safe and there's nothing to be afraid of, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5411.68s)]
*  where you can release. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5417.24s)]
*  Going with intentions. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5418.92s)]
*  Yes, it was very, very intentional, very spiritually focused. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5419.68s)]
*  And take it in with preparation before you go in. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5424.599999999999s)]
*  And then and you have to do integration afterwards. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5428.16s)]
*  You can't just have the experience. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5430.32s)]
*  You need to integrate it into your life. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5431.72s)]
*  I highly recommend that it's life changing. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5433.4400000000005s)]
*  John, before we close out, where can people follow you? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5436.04s)]
*  Where can they find out more about love life and about? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5439.92s)]
*  Well, they can follow me at johnpmackie.com. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5442.400000000001s)]
*  That's my personal website. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5446.320000000001s)]
*  John pmackie.com. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5447.92s)]
*  They can find out a love life at love.life. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5449.68s)]
*  Www.love.life. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5453.400000000001s)]
*  Love that. And of course, the whole story, please, if you're an entrepreneur, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5455.56s)]
*  if you love Whole Foods, if you want an extraordinary book, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5459.84s)]
*  let me pitch this for you. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5465.6s)]
*  Whole Life was an amazing book. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5467.2s)]
*  I really enjoyed listening to it. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5468.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm sure the reading is equally pleasurable, but [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5470.4800000000005s)]
*  I assume on Amazon available. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5474.360000000001s)]
*  The whole story Adventures in Love Life and Capitalism is available at on Amazon. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5477.72s)]
*  It's Whole Foods is selling it. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5482.84s)]
*  And some bookstores are. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5485.56s)]
*  I'm a little bit unhappy that I feel like I defend capitalism [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5487.6s)]
*  so strongly in my book that I thought maybe it was offensive to some people. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5493.04s)]
*  By the way, I brand myself always as a libertarian capitalist. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5497.52s)]
*  So I think I think we both have that in common. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5501.6s)]
*  We do. I definitely [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5504.92s)]
*  I've kind of moved away from libertarian because it's beginning. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5507.56s)]
*  The brand is beginning to be stained with, you know, Nazi fascism, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5510.4800000000005s)]
*  which is the opposite of those things. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5514.56s)]
*  Exactly. But it's original classical liberal. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5516.08s)]
*  Yes. People always want to know what's a classical liberal? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5519.72s)]
*  And that gives me a chance to expound on the classical liberal principles [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5522.64s)]
*  that that really built our country. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5526.16s)]
*  Yeah. But a pleasure. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5528.76s)]
*  And thank you for spending the time with me. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5532.28s)]
*  I learned a lot and hope you enjoyed it as well. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5534.68s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. I look forward to meeting in person. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqN-kFKJkc&t=5537.5199999999995s)]
