# Meta’s 15 Billion Dollar AI Bet & The Race To ASI w/ Salim Ismail & Dave Blundin
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw)
*  We are going to become limited by power in our quest for digital superintelligence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a structural issue we have in the US. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  This is America's Achilles heel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=10.32s)]
*  China is going all in on energy production and it's epic. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=11.84s)]
*  Meta is worth $1.8 trillion today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=16.4s)]
*  They've got $70 billion in cash. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=20.68s)]
*  These offers of $100 million or their acquisition offers on companies, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=23.2s)]
*  It really is a winner-take-all mindset in this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=27.88s)]
*  The natural dynamic is winner-takes-all because the AI becomes self-improving very, very soon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=31.64s)]
*  The biggest threat to Meta is that they fall way behind on AI. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  We're in the middle of probably the greatest drama in human history here, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=42.44s)]
*  which is why everyone should be tracking these moves closely. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=46.44s)]
*  These numbers are so unprecedented, but they're completely justifiable given the impact. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=48.6s)]
*  Now that's a moonshot, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=54.0s)]
*  Welcome to an episode of WTF on moonshots. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=57.32s)]
*  I'm here with my moonshot mates, Salim Ismael. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=63.68s)]
*  Salim, I'm calling you the emperor of exponentials because that's just who you are. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=66.76s)]
*  And Dave London, the alchemist of AI. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=71.08s)]
*  How's that for a title? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=75.64s)]
*  We need one for you, Peter. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=77.48s)]
*  All right, Peter, you have to be something epic. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=80.28s)]
*  How about the humongous bungalongus of abundance? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=83.4s)]
*  Not sure I like that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=87.0s)]
*  I like what Dee came and said on stage. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=87.8s)]
*  She called me the Pope of Hope. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=89.48s)]
*  The Pope of Hope. That's awesome. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=91.08s)]
*  Yeah, my mom liked that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=93.48s)]
*  She's watching all of my abundance videos and the whole show on stage. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=94.68s)]
*  And she writes back, she goes, Pope of Hope, I love that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank Dean for me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=103.56s)]
*  We have a lot to cover today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=106.12s)]
*  And as always, our goal here is to deliver you the real news, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=107.72s)]
*  the news that's going to impact you, the news that's changing every industry, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=112.76s)]
*  every family, every country right here right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=117.16s)]
*  So rather than watching the six o'clock news, join us on this epic mission. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=120.52s)]
*  Deliver a compelling, hopeful and abundant future. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=124.52s)]
*  All right, buddy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=129.88s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=131.16s)]
*  Buddies, let's jump in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=131.48s)]
*  So let's talk about all things AI another epic week. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=132.84s)]
*  Every week is just accelerating. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=135.8s)]
*  It feels that way. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's kick it off with this conversation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  This is from Elon and I'll just read his tweet. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=143.08s)]
*  He says basically, we will use Grok 3.5. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=146.28s)]
*  Maybe we should be calling it Grok 4, which has advanced reasoning to rewrite [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=154.28s)]
*  errors and then retraining on that new corpus. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=158.84s)]
*  So first of all, we've got this like name escalation, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=163.0s)]
*  So we're going to GPT-5 and then Gemini 2.5 through Gemini 3. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=167.4s)]
*  I think Elon feels behind Grok 3.5. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=173.32s)]
*  Numerical warfare? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  Dave, what do you think about this idea of retraining Grok 3.5 on a new corpus [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  corrected by AI and getting rid of human errors? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=184.6s)]
*  Yeah, that specific idea is actually low hanging fruit and a real big win. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=188.28s)]
*  But it's one of many big wins. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=192.76s)]
*  I mean, the rate of change of what we've seen in the models in the last two weeks [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=194.2s)]
*  since last time we talked is just mind boggling. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=197.16s)]
*  And an experience everyone needs to have is if you pick up either Gemini 2.5 Pro [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=200.44s)]
*  or GPT-4 voice mode and just talk to it as you're driving in a car for like an hour or two hours. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=207.56s)]
*  That's something you couldn't do a month ago. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=215.48s)]
*  And now you can do it and it's engaging. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=217.72s)]
*  And if you draw a line between a month ago and today and you look a month into the future, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  it's going to replace a lot of what you do in terms of media. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=225.72s)]
*  It's just so incredibly engaging all of a sudden. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=229.0s)]
*  So I think what Elon's talking about here is look, the training data, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=232.2s)]
*  you know, believe it or not, the actual original training data for these models [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=235.64s)]
*  had a Reddit subreddit in it that's called Microwave. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=238.44s)]
*  And the Microwave subreddit has a series of M's just goes, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=242.44s)]
*  for thousands and thousands of lines. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=246.28s)]
*  And then at the end, it goes beep. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=249.08s)]
*  So that gets scraped and gets thrown into the training data. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=252.12s)]
*  A lot of crap. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=255.4s)]
*  Okay, there's a lot of crap. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think, you know, Elon might actually be referring to a lot of his own tweets with [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=257.48s)]
*  with Donald Trump here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=260.76s)]
*  Okay, well, if we get rid of that crap, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=263.0s)]
*  then the neural net has a much easier time learning what really matters. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=265.08s)]
*  So this is part of a long list of low hanging fruit [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=268.68s)]
*  that's right in front of these training algorithms. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=273.08s)]
*  So you're going to see really rapid improvement just from the obvious, including this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=275.4s)]
*  Salim, what could possibly go wrong if AI rewrites the corpus of human knowledge? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, I've been watching a few videos of Yuval Harari talk about, oh my God, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=285.32s)]
*  AI can now program itself and program things. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  And he's going to go nuts on this type of concept where if you can edit history, right, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=293.08s)]
*  where do you end up? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=298.67999999999995s)]
*  Where do you draw the line? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=299.4s)]
*  Who decides what's accurate or not? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=300.68s)]
*  In the beginning, there was AI. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=302.44s)]
*  And it was good. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=305.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=305.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=306.76s)]
*  God said, let there be AI. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=307.32s)]
*  And then everything followed from there, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=308.92s)]
*  This really has, will pose some huge philosophical challenges. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=312.04s)]
*  Now, on the plus side, there are so many gaps. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=315.72s)]
*  There are so many flawed narratives where history is written by the winners of all the epic battles [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=319.0s)]
*  and wars in the past. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=324.04s)]
*  And therefore, we can balance out that viewpoint a little bit and get a little bit more reality. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=326.12s)]
*  That'd be great. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=330.2s)]
*  But there's a very dangerous line here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=331.24s)]
*  And I think it's the right thing to do. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=333.96s)]
*  It's going to cause a lot of consternation. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=336.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=338.36s)]
*  So we're expecting Grok 3.5 any day now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=338.92s)]
*  He was promised in May, then delayed into early June. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=342.36s)]
*  What is today? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=345.4s)]
*  We're recording this on June 26. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=346.28s)]
*  So he said by the end of June, he's got four days left. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=348.6s)]
*  But even if it's July, it's going to be epic. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=352.44s)]
*  Can't wait to try and play with it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=354.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=356.6s)]
*  I'm going to play this video. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=358.28s)]
*  Also from Elon. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=359.56s)]
*  And the subtext here is superintelligence may happen this year or by the end of next year. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=361.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=367.8s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=368.12s)]
*  I think we're quite close to digital superintelligence. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=369.48s)]
*  It may happen this year. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=373.4s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't happen this year. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=375.96s)]
*  Next year for sure. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=377.32s)]
*  The digital superintelligence defined as is smarter than any human at anything. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=378.76s)]
*  So here we've got the issue of definition. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=390.91999999999996s)]
*  What is AGI? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  What is digital superintelligence? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  Dave, you and I recorded an episode we'll be sharing shortly with Eric Schmidt going [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  deep into digital superintelligence. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  His prediction is a little bit more, you know, I don't say pessimistic, but you know, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=401.96s)]
*  it's the next five years on his time frame. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  But what is it? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=412.2s)]
*  Do you still have the confusion that I do when people are popping back and forth between [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=413.64000000000004s)]
*  AGI and ASI? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=418.12s)]
*  Yeah, because no one's really locked down a clear definition. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=420.04s)]
*  But I think Elon gave a very, very clear definition in that presentation just for that reason. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  AI that can do anything better, any intellectual task better than any human. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=428.12s)]
*  That's the hardcore definition. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  And he's saying by the end of next year, which is the soonest date that people are saying. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=434.44s)]
*  But he's very close to the progress. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=439.32s)]
*  So, you know, he has every reason to be right. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=441.64s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=443.32s)]
*  I would not doubt his timeline. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=444.36s)]
*  I actually went on to chat GPT and GROK and asked them both for a definition of AGI versus ASI. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=446.68s)]
*  Can I share that with you guys? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=453.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=455.64s)]
*  So chat GPT says AGI is a machine capable of understanding, learning and performing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=456.28s)]
*  any intellectual task that a human can do across domains with reasoning, adaptability and autonomy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=462.52s)]
*  And then it says ASI, this is chat GPT, is an intelligence far surpassing the best human [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=469.24s)]
*  in every field, creating with creativity, problem solving, decision making. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  GROK says AGI is an AI capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=479.8s)]
*  with general problem solving. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=486.44s)]
*  And ASI is AI surpassing human intelligence in all intellectual tasks. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=488.20000000000005s)]
*  Even these definitions sort of blur the line. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=494.44s)]
*  Yeah, I go on my classic hobby horse here because we have no idea what we're talking [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=499.16s)]
*  about when we talk about intelligence. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=504.36s)]
*  And so I don't need to get into that trope again. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=507.0s)]
*  But let me suggest this, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  The minute you can prescriptively, if you want to define something like this, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=511.16s)]
*  you have to define what you mean by it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=514.9200000000001s)]
*  And the minute you can prescriptively describe a task, an AI or robot is going to be much [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=516.9200000000001s)]
*  better than you anyway. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=521.48s)]
*  So the work that comes then comes down to what was the task prescriptively saying that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  it'd be smarter than a human being. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=527.64s)]
*  That's a different kind of a model. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=529.48s)]
*  Here's where I'd like to see it do. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=531.1600000000001s)]
*  So you have Kepler a couple hundred years ago, one day making an intuitive leap that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=532.9200000000001s)]
*  maybe the moon is affecting the tides and makes a massive intuitive leap that then can [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  be backed up with scientific and experimental evidence. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=543.64s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that if AIs can do, then you start tickling at the edges of what [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=546.6s)]
*  we mean by intelligence because we have emotional intelligence, we have spiritual intelligence, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=551.24s)]
*  etc. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=556.04s)]
*  There's the end of my rant. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=557.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's going to happen. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=559.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, one of the predictions is we're going to start to see math, physics, chemistry, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  biology getting solved by these advanced AI models in the next two to five years. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=564.92s)]
*  I mean, this is what our friend Alex Wiesner-Groves keeps on hitting on. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=572.12s)]
*  We're going to solve math in the next 12 months. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=575.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's important to stay out of the philosophical debate if you want to succeed [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  with AI and focus on the capabilities within swim lanes. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=583.16s)]
*  Because the reason Elon Musk is saying, look, guys, I'm talking about AI that can do literally [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=587.64s)]
*  any human intellectual task better than any human. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=592.36s)]
*  He's just trying to create awareness and motion because people are underreacting so badly [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  in so many areas. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=600.04s)]
*  But I think as Alex Wiesner-Groves is saying, it gets miles ahead in areas like math and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  code writing where it's not data constrained. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=608.6s)]
*  And it lags behind in areas like biology where it needs the full cell simulator to make forward [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=611.64s)]
*  progress. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=617.16s)]
*  And so the rate of progress is going to be hugely different in these different swim lanes. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=617.8s)]
*  The exact date when it can do any intellectual task versus any other human is going to be [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=621.8s)]
*  like a blur that comes and goes. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=625.96s)]
*  And whether somebody was right down to the minute or not, nobody will care a year later. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=627.48s)]
*  But we'll care a lot about the impact on society and all these different use cases. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=632.6s)]
*  So I think going down that path of saying here's a vector or swim lane, that's a really [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=637.16s)]
*  good way of framing it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=642.1999999999999s)]
*  But when you throw out general words like AGI or ASI or whatever, that's when I go a [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=644.1999999999999s)]
*  little bit nuts. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=648.36s)]
*  But the swim lane thing, I can totally vibe with that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=648.92s)]
*  Every week, I study the 10 major tech meta trends that will transform industries over [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=651.48s)]
*  the decade ahead. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=656.8399999999999s)]
*  I cover trends ranging from humanoid robots, AGI, quantum computing, transport, energy, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  longevity, and more. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=663.3199999999999s)]

*  All right. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=710.5999999999999s)]
*  I love this video. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=712.28s)]
*  I asked the team to cut it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=713.64s)]
*  This is from Jeff Klune, who's a DeepMind advisor. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=715.16s)]
*  The title here is, The First ASI May Be the Last ASI. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=719.1600000000001s)]
*  So take a listen to this. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=726.9200000000001s)]
*  It is a world in which the first AI is the last AI. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=728.5200000000001s)]
*  And the creation of the first ASI suppresses the creation of ASI worldwide. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=731.6400000000001s)]
*  Then that organization, whoever they are, has a decision to make. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=736.84s)]
*  And that decision is, we just invented effectively, if that thing is aligned to them and we'll [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=740.2s)]
*  obey their commands, we just effectively invented a god. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=744.6800000000001s)]
*  Do we want to sit around and let those people over there also invent a god? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=748.2s)]
*  And nobody talks about as much as they probably should is how quickly things might get nationalized. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=753.08s)]
*  If you are the premier or prime minister or head of state of a country and somebody, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=757.96s)]
*  a company within your borders creates a super weapon, a superpower effectively, a god, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=764.44s)]
*  do you nationalize that? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=768.84s)]
*  Do you start giving them orders? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=770.2s)]
*  Do you make them run everything by you? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=771.32s)]
*  Are you going to let them just like run as a normal company? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=772.6s)]
*  Like that seems very unlikely to me. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=774.6s)]
*  So just wow, right? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=776.84s)]
*  I mean, I can very much imagine that. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=779.0s)]
*  In fact, I just read a book with my son, Jett, called After On. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=780.92s)]
*  Actually, second time I've read it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=785.16s)]
*  And it tells a Silicon Valley story of the first ASI coming online. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=787.0s)]
*  And it is basically taken over by the government. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=791.16s)]
*  And it is basically the last ASI because it suppresses other AIs around the world. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=793.96s)]
*  It's a great story. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=799.56s)]
*  Dave, what do you think about that? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=801.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, hey, Salim, we have our side bet. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=803.56s)]
*  This really weighs in my favor. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=805.64s)]
*  Look, the natural dynamic here is winner take all. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=807.08s)]
*  And you're going to see later in this podcast, the amount of competitive pressure on these [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=809.88s)]
*  foundation model companies to get the best talent, the amount they're willing to pay [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=814.04s)]
*  is mind blowing. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=817.64s)]
*  Well, why is that? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=818.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, because the natural dynamic is winner takes all because the AI becomes self-improving [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=819.0s)]
*  very, very soon. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=823.4s)]
*  So the observation in that video is right on target. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=825.0s)]
*  And the only force that's going to, you know, in our first slide here, we're saying, look, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=830.04s)]
*  if the data that goes into these is one view, one point of view, and it's self-fixing, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=834.76s)]
*  but it filters out other points of view, that could be terrible. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=841.0799999999999s)]
*  And so the only way you're going to have a variety of these, and, you know, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=845.4s)]
*  America thrives on a variety of competitors in any given market, a variety of viewpoints, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=849.48s)]
*  that has to come through some kind of regulatory framework. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=853.88s)]
*  It's not going to happen with the natural winner take all dynamic. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=856.4399999999999s)]
*  So this is a great wake up call video, and I completely agree. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=859.3199999999999s)]
*  Salim, winner take all? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=862.1999999999999s)]
*  I think I'm not sure about the winner take all. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=864.5999999999999s)]
*  I'll stay with my bet on that one. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=867.64s)]
*  So Dave and I will continue. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=869.64s)]
*  It'd be great to have a polymarket on this, by the way. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=871.64s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=873.64s)]
*  But the idea that when something like this emerges that it might get nationalized is 100% [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=874.4399999999999s)]
*  true. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=880.52s)]
*  There's no way that's not going to happen while these, and I think this is what the [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=881.0s)]
*  governments are doing right now. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=885.4s)]
*  They're just watching their various folks work on stuff, and they're going to jump on [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=886.4399999999999s)]
*  the show, something like this. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=891.0s)]
*  And nationalization may take a different flavor. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=892.2s)]
*  It may be the government buying a significant share. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=895.4s)]
*  We're going to talk about what the government's doing in AI. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=898.6s)]
*  Oh, I don't think it's going to be like that. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=902.2s)]
*  I think it'll be just like, I'm sorry, we own that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=903.8s)]
*  It's a military potential. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=906.2s)]
*  Boom. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=908.2s)]
*  And you've lost kind of agency. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=908.6s)]
*  There goes the US. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=912.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=913.4s)]
*  Well, I think that's going to happen. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=913.8s)]
*  And I wouldn't, from what I've seen with governments, there's no way they're not going [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=915.4s)]
*  to do that. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=919.0s)]
*  They almost have to do it in order to prevent other people from getting there if they think [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=919.4s)]
*  they're getting there first. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=924.1999999999999s)]
*  The bigger picture might be, if you have a particular worldview, what do you do with [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=925.0s)]
*  that when you have ASI? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=932.6s)]
*  Because I have a feeling that ASI is going to strip past the limitations of a particular [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=933.8s)]
*  worldview very quickly. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=939.0s)]
*  And so then what do you do? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=940.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=942.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=943.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=943.8s)]
*  Let me just build on that for a second. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=945.4s)]
*  Here's what I think will happen. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=947.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=949.0s)]
*  Some ASI, whatever we want to call that, will emerge. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=949.4s)]
*  A national government, call it Kazakhstan, will kind of go, we need to own that. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=953.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=957.8000000000001s)]
*  This is our worldview. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=958.2s)]
*  ASI, please operate on this worldview. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=959.8000000000001s)]
*  And then let's get everybody else to align with this worldview. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=961.4s)]
*  And the AIs, in about three seconds, is going to go, their worldview is so limited. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=964.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=969.4s)]
*  It skips right past all of that. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  I think once you have ASI, it's outside the potential for control for anybody. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=971.4s)]
*  For sure. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=976.5999999999999s)]
*  And maybe this is like the modality of religions taking over and setting a worldview around [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=977.4s)]
*  the world. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=985.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=988.1999999999999s)]
*  You have to relate to it in that way, except that religions are, you know, they're based [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=988.5999999999999s)]
*  on a certain set of rules. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=992.5999999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, I think that's going to be a big issue. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=994.1999999999999s)]
*  I think you have to relate to it in that way, except that religions are, you know, they're [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=997.4s)]
*  based on absolute, unverifiable truths, or assumptive truths. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1001.4s)]
*  Like Mary was a virgin, or Muhammad was the last prophet, or Jesus was the son of God, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1005.0s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1009.8000000000001s)]
*  And in AI, any kind of AI half its worth would skip past that assumptive truth instantly [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1010.6s)]
*  and go, there's no evidentiary basis for that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1016.2s)]
*  I'm sorry, Yoro. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1018.2s)]
*  I don't think there's much of any chance that the US is going to nationalize a single AI [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1019.4s)]
*  company and say, this is our national AI. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1024.2s)]
*  The Defense Department works. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1026.2s)]
*  You know, some things like uranium and plutonium refinement are nationalized. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1027.4s)]
*  But, you know, all the missiles, inertial guidance, defense systems, these are all private [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1031.0s)]
*  sector companies that work for the government. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1035.0s)]
*  That's going to be the likely outcome in AI as well in the US, maybe not in China, maybe [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1038.6000000000001s)]
*  not in the Middle East, but certainly in the US. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1043.2s)]
*  Well, we're going to find out in the next few years. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1045.0s)]
*  I think that's the key point here. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1047.4s)]
*  By the end of next year, clearly. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1049.2s)]
*  By the way, Jeff looks more like an AI in that than anything in any video I've seen in a [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1050.6000000000001s)]
*  long time. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1054.6000000000001s)]
*  This next story is one I want to dive into. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1056.2s)]
*  The title here is Metatry to buy Ilya Sutskevich's $32 billion AI startup and now planning to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1060.2s)]
*  hire its CEO. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1067.2s)]
*  We'll get into this in a moment, but I just want to pass a theory by you. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1068.8s)]
*  So how does Ilya get a $32 billion valuation? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1073.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1078.2s)]
*  So he basically goes out, he pitches Andreessen Horowitz. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1079.2s)]
*  His investors are Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, DST Global, which is Yuri Milner, Alphabet, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1084.6s)]
*  NVIDIA, Lightspeed Ventures. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, like the AAA list of investors. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1092.1999999999998s)]
*  And he raises, what was it, $6 billion of capital on a $32 billion valuation. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1096.1999999999998s)]
*  How do you do that without any product or any tech to show? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1102.0s)]
*  And I have a theory. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1107.1999999999998s)]
*  Here's my theory. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1108.1999999999998s)]
*  You ready? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1109.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1110.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1111.1999999999998s)]
*  So in his presentation on the first ASI, his last ASI, he goes in and he says to these [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1112.8s)]
*  venture funds, listen, I know how to build an ASI that will blow away the other AI companies. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1118.2s)]
*  It will be a safe ASI because here's my strategy. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1126.68s)]
*  And because it's the first, it will be the last. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1130.72s)]
*  You believe him. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1134.48s)]
*  And as a venture fund, you have no other choice than to invest in that company at whatever [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1136.72s)]
*  valuation he offers you to. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1143.68s)]
*  He offers it to you. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1146.24s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1147.48s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1149.76s)]
*  And I think there's another point, which is that clearly the true great neural architect [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1151.48s)]
*  The Illyas, the Miramarades are not intimidated by the progress that's been made at OpenAI, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1158.6399999999999s)]
*  Grok, and Google. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1165.8s)]
*  And that's an amazing fact by itself. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1168.0s)]
*  And when you look under the covers, the research teams working on this are 10, 15 people. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1170.08s)]
*  They're not 10,000 people. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1173.8s)]
*  And the innovations are still piling up, you know, where there are still 10x improvements [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1176.4399999999998s)]
*  out there. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1181.1599999999999s)]
*  And so undoubtedly, Illya, having been an architect right in the middle of this, is [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1182.3999999999999s)]
*  saying, look, I know how to 10x this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1188.12s)]
*  And I'm not afraid of the big guys. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1190.4399999999998s)]
*  And actually, the actions at OpenAI are kind of reinforcing that. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1193.1599999999999s)]
*  OpenAI is racing to control the consumer experience with buying Windsurf for coding and having [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1196.9599999999998s)]
*  the voice mode and trying to get everyone, they're trying to be like Google and have [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1202.84s)]
*  a huge user base installed. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1206.9599999999998s)]
*  And they're succeeding, by the way. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1209.04s)]
*  And they're succeeding a lot wildly. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1210.56s)]
*  Because you know, just competing as a foundation model is not necessarily defensible. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1213.16s)]
*  And so it's not just Illya, it's Mira, and then also some other things bubbling up out [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1217.68s)]
*  of MIT that are getting huge valuations because they're very likely to work. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1221.32s)]
*  And so I think that's the other kind of underpinning here. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1225.48s)]
*  We're in the middle of probably the greatest drama in human history here, which is why [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1227.92s)]
*  everyone should be tracking these moves closely. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1232.16s)]
*  These numbers are so unprecedented, so much bigger than anything in history, but they're [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1234.04s)]
*  completely justifiable given the impact. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1238.48s)]
*  And so more people should be getting involved and reacting and contributing and not being [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1241.4s)]
*  intimidated because Mira's not intimidated, Illya's not intimidated, and the investors [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1246.64s)]
*  coming in to invest in Illya are not intimidated. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1250.8400000000001s)]
*  Billion dollars a day. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1254.3200000000002s)]
*  Saleem, do you remember the meme that came out when Illya left OpenAI or staged the revolt? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1255.3200000000002s)]
*  It was like the meme was, what did Illya see? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1262.04s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1264.44s)]
*  And now I want to know, what did Illya pitch? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1266.24s)]
*  Is the new meme here. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1271.1200000000001s)]
*  Saleem, what do you think about this $32 billion valuation? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1272.1200000000001s)]
*  Does he have an ASI in the bag and he's racing out in front? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1275.96s)]
*  I think this conversation kind of nails it, right? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1280.44s)]
*  If you're in front of investors, they don't know. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1282.72s)]
*  They're kind of trusting you to know. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1284.8s)]
*  And the fact that they kind of have a confidence-based approach to saying, we can beat the other [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1286.96s)]
*  models is huge. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1293.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think Dave's assessment is right. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1295.52s)]
*  OpenAI is now focused on how do you get to the biggest consumer share in this and they [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1297.32s)]
*  will go after those other white spaces that are there. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1302.4799999999998s)]
*  And there's a lot of white space. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1305.76s)]
*  So applying this in all sorts of areas becomes hugely... [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1307.32s)]
*  But my big question for this is how do you do this safely is my question. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1311.4799999999998s)]
*  And I'd love to understand what did he say to investors that gave them the sense that [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1315.32s)]
*  this could be done safely? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1319.6s)]
*  Because that's the foundation of his approach, right? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1320.6s)]
*  We're going to make AGI that's safe. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1322.52s)]
*  That's the name of his company. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1324.44s)]
*  Safe Super Intellectuals. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1325.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm curious how he's going about that. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1327.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1329.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1330.68s)]
*  The other side of the story here is that Meta is trying to buy talent left, right and center. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1331.68s)]
*  Let's take a listen to this video. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1338.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1339.76s)]
*  OpenAI CEO Sam Alman has some strong words from Mark Zuckerberg on a new podcast criticizing [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1340.76s)]
*  Meta's recruitment methods and even its level of innovation. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1346.72s)]
*  Dear Triposa, with more... [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1349.8000000000002s)]
*  It's cutthroat out there, Brian. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1351.76s)]
*  You're right. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1353.24s)]
*  I mean, critical words, maybe an understatement. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1355.08s)]
*  So Sam Alman on his brother's podcast, he says that Zuckerberg is offering $100 million [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1356.08s)]
*  sign-on bonuses to poach top OpenAI talent. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1361.44s)]
*  Keep in mind, those kind of bonuses, they don't have cliffs. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1364.48s)]
*  They don't vest over a number of years. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1367.64s)]
*  $100 million just to get on board. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1369.68s)]
*  Nothing's stopping talent from leaving in what is already a revolving door of talent [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1372.28s)]
*  in AI. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1376.88s)]
*  Salim, did you get an offer of $100 million from Zach yet? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1377.88s)]
*  No. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1381.88s)]
*  Can I please be an intern at one of those companies and maybe I'll get a 20 million [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1382.88s)]
*  signing bonus? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1386.64s)]
*  It's insane, right? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1387.64s)]
*  So here are the numbers, just to put this in context. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1390.24s)]
*  Meta is worth $1.8 trillion today. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1392.88s)]
*  They've got $70 billion in cash. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1395.64s)]
*  So if you think of it that way, these offers of $100 million or their acquisition offers [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1398.92s)]
*  on companies, because Meta tried to buy SSI first, it makes sense. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1406.1200000000001s)]
*  The biggest threat to Meta is that they fall way behind on AI. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1412.9199999999998s)]
*  Dave, what's your calculus here? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1418.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's so much. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1420.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't believe for a minute that it's $100 million to join no [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1422.12s)]
*  vesting, no retail. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1426.36s)]
*  You can't just join and quit the next day. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1427.9199999999998s)]
*  There's no way that's true. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1429.32s)]
*  I don't know where that fact came from. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1430.32s)]
*  But look, these numbers, again, you see professional athletes getting numbers like this, but other [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1431.9599999999998s)]
*  it's unprecedented in human history, but it's hugely justified if you get one of the key [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1437.0800000000002s)]
*  research talents at this inflection moment in the competition toward ASI. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1444.0800000000002s)]
*  So it does make a lot of sense. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1449.88s)]
*  I don't know if the choices of who to go after are necessarily right. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1452.0800000000002s)]
*  We heard on our tour through San Francisco two weeks ago, Peter, that the Lama IV really [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1457.1200000000001s)]
*  does suck. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1461.2s)]
*  And it's kind of embarrassing. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1463.4s)]
*  I know Mark tried to save it with a podcast world tour there. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1464.8000000000002s)]
*  But look, if it sucks, it sucks. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1468.92s)]
*  Doesn't mean that they can't catch up in a heartbeat, though, because a couple tweaks [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1470.5600000000002s)]
*  in the algorithm and suddenly you're back on top. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1473.7s)]
*  And so you get the right people who know exactly how to try the next experiment, the next tweak. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1476.14s)]
*  And it's worth a lot more than $100 million. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1481.24s)]
*  It's worth many billions, if not a trillion. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1483.3200000000002s)]
*  And so I think that's the bet that they're making. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1485.68s)]
*  And this isn't the only one. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1488.24s)]
*  There's a lot more of these going on. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1489.48s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a $70 billion war chest. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1491.0s)]
*  And it really is a winner-take-all mindset in this. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1494.32s)]
*  They're willing to do whatever it takes to move forward. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1499.52s)]
*  Can I game this out a little bit? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1501.6s)]
*  So if we go back to the previous conversation, I think what Ilya has figured out is how do [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1505.2s)]
*  you use AI to tweak itself. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1509.88s)]
*  And that then gives you a very, very fast iteration path to what you're trying to do. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1514.0s)]
*  And if the investors believe something like that, then they go, wow, if he's figured that [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1519.94s)]
*  out, then nothing will stop that from being the winner. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1523.7s)]
*  I think you're right about that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1526.46s)]
*  Now regarding this particular thing, when WhatsApp was bought for, what, $18 billion, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1528.66s)]
*  everybody laughed at Zuckerberg and thought, this is nuts. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1536.46s)]
*  This is unprecedented, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1539.74s)]
*  But it was actually a hugely important and relevant bet. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1541.8200000000002s)]
*  So given the past success in throwing money at this and going after it, you can see that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1546.34s)]
*  he can see the market is that big. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1552.1399999999999s)]
*  And this is pennies in the dollar in terms of the potential outcome. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1555.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I would never bet against Mark for exactly the reason you just said. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1560.1399999999999s)]
*  He can act unilaterally and quickly, and he's aggressive and he's super, super smart. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1562.84s)]
*  And so what is interesting, though, is the other thing we learned on our tour through [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1567.3s)]
*  San Francisco two weeks ago is there is a mass exodus of AI talent out of Meta. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1570.9399999999998s)]
*  So then Sam's saying, hey, they're trying to buy everybody back for $100 million. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1576.14s)]
*  Like, well, dude, you just took everybody's. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1578.94s)]
*  It's fair game. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1580.94s)]
*  But the question I have is why were they leaving in the first place? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1583.5800000000002s)]
*  And why did Llama 4 not come out the way they wanted it? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1586.74s)]
*  And so we'll dig in on that. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1589.6200000000001s)]
*  I'll try and try and get to the bottom of exactly what's going on there. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1590.6200000000001s)]
*  But the tide is certainly throwing money at it is one way to turn the tide. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1594.14s)]
*  Yeah, so the story here again is Meta tried to buy SSI. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1597.22s)]
*  They were rebuffed. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1602.74s)]
*  And now they're trying to hire Daniel Gross, who is the CEO of SSI, and Nat Friedman, who's [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1604.82s)]
*  been on our stage at Abundance 360. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1612.5s)]
*  Again, he's out shopping and he just made an acquisition. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1616.74s)]
*  He hit the Neiman Marcus store for AI and he basically bought our friends at Scale AI. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1620.94s)]
*  Alexander Wang also was on stage with me a couple of years ago at A360. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1628.34s)]
*  $14.8 billion for 49% of non-voting stake in Scale AI. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1633.98s)]
*  Dave, the IPO markets are just beginning to open in the tech and AI space. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1641.78s)]
*  The acquisition markets are getting hot. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1648.74s)]
*  So you're deploying Link XPV's venture fund in companies out of MIT and Harvard. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1652.82s)]
*  How are you seeing sort of the acceleration? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1658.62s)]
*  Because it's been relatively a closed IPO and acquisition market over the last five years. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1660.58s)]
*  Does it feel like it's opening up now? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1668.3799999999999s)]
*  I'd say as of the last month, it's wide open. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1671.62s)]
*  I mean, these deals are unprecedented huge deals. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1674.34s)]
*  The core we've IPO is way up, circle is way up because it's the way that agents can transact [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1677.38s)]
*  with each other. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1683.0600000000002s)]
*  So yeah, the Yahoo moment clearly happens. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1684.98s)]
*  The door is wide open. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1688.2600000000002s)]
*  The deals are still concentrated among the top, the magnificent seven, but Jamie Dimon [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1692.1000000000001s)]
*  sees that, Bank of America, everybody else sees that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1698.14s)]
*  So their banking teams are spooling up. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1700.66s)]
*  Getting ready. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1703.1399999999999s)]
*  That's it's going to be just like 1997, 98 all over again. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1703.74s)]
*  That'd be great. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1707.78s)]
*  Much bigger. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1708.3799999999999s)]
*  So also, you know, a couple, I don't know if people care, but the structure of the deal [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1709.62s)]
*  is really important. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1712.78s)]
*  And I know a lot about the topic if you can cut it out of the podcast if people don't [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1714.6999999999998s)]
*  care. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1719.86s)]
*  But this is the deal structure of the future. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1720.06s)]
*  The 49% acquisition dodges, hard, Scott Rodino. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1721.9399999999998s)]
*  So the deal is closed the day you sign it. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1725.5s)]
*  You don't have to go through the six month torture waiting cycle of DOJ review. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1727.58s)]
*  And it does skirt the edge of the rules, but the rules are bright line. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1732.62s)]
*  So and the there are two parts to it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1736.8999999999999s)]
*  Forty nine percent is not a controlling stake. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1740.34s)]
*  So you don't have to report. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1742.3s)]
*  The other part is it's a non voting stake. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1743.9799999999998s)]
*  There's another threshold of nineteen point nine percent or 20 percent ownership where [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1745.9799999999998s)]

*  But because it's a non voting stake, you dodge that rule as well. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1751.9399999999998s)]
*  They're like, well, OK, but do I really own the company? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1755.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, then you look at the contractual structure, which isn't disclosed. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1757.78s)]
*  There's no public disclosure of the underlying agreement. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1761.38s)]
*  And that agreement probably says we own all the intellectual property. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1764.5s)]
*  And if you don't work your ass off, you have to come clean windows at Mark's house. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1767.42s)]
*  And a whole bunch of things like that that really effectively make you own the company. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1771.78s)]
*  And I also know that the investors in scale are distributing the capital. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1776.5400000000002s)]
*  So it's not it's not disappearing into the corporation. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1780.78s)]
*  It's going to the shareholders and getting distributed to the investors in the company. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1783.42s)]
*  So it's truly an acquisition. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1787.46s)]
*  There's a coming wave of technological convergence as AI, robots and other exponential tech [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1789.18s)]

*  You and I both have spent time with Jan Lakoon, who previously was heading AI at Meta. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1842.94s)]
*  And now Alexander Wang comes in. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1850.06s)]
*  Alexander, I guess Dave, he was a freshman at MIT, dropped out after his freshman year [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1852.02s)]
*  to start Scale AI, becomes a... [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1858.14s)]
*  Was he the youngest billionaire out of MIT? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1860.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1863.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1864.38s)]
*  By far. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1865.38s)]
*  And now he's going to... [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1866.38s)]
*  I wonder if Jan is going to stay on at Meta. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1868.1s)]
*  Any thoughts there, Salim? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1872.02s)]
*  I think, well, clearly there's a changing of the guard there. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1874.62s)]
*  And whatever they feel, they're deficient and they're trying to leapfrog and they're [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1878.78s)]
*  doing it very, very aggressively. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1884.18s)]
*  Something that I love about Scale AI, it's really attacking the heart of the problem, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1886.34s)]
*  which is tagging of data. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1889.86s)]
*  And if you have that, you can solve the garbage and garbage problem in a really powerful way. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1892.38s)]
*  And then it means you can use much better models to...the models you use become much...you [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1897.62s)]
*  can use lesser models because you have much better data. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1902.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1905.62s)]
*  I think Jan Lakoon, just to bring it back to that, and he's a super brilliant sweetheart [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1906.62s)]
*  guy at the center of this all, but he's had a much more conservative point of view on [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1911.9399999999998s)]
*  AGI and ASI. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1918.9399999999998s)]
*  It's the same with Jeff Hinton. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1921.1399999999999s)]
*  Jan is kind of in that camp of being...everybody needs to slow down and be really, really careful [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1922.86s)]
*  of what we're about to unlock here. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1928.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think Mark has the opposite, yeah. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1931.74s)]
*  Mark is an engineer at heart. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1934.58s)]
*  All these guys are engineers at heart. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1935.86s)]
*  They're not trying to buy an AI philosopher. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1937.18s)]
*  They're not trying to buy...a lot of the people that are the senior AI leaders from the big [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1938.94s)]
*  labs are saying, look, there's something fundamentally missing from these transformers. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1943.7s)]
*  They're not actually reasoning. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1948.04s)]
*  They're just brute forcing their way to intelligence. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1949.32s)]
*  They don't want to buy that. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1951.8999999999999s)]
*  What they want to buy is, I know how to make this algorithm work on a million concurrent [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1953.54s)]
*  GPUs. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1958.06s)]
*  I know how to change the algorithm so that it stays synchronous across all this massive [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1959.06s)]
*  amount of compute. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1963.46s)]
*  I know how to actually deploy the transfer algorithms. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1964.46s)]
*  The swig-loo isn't working. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1969.5s)]
*  We need to go back to relu. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1970.62s)]
*  Stuff like that. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1972.22s)]
*  That's in the minds of these mid-20-year-old geniuses. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1973.4199999999998s)]
*  That's what they want to buy. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1976.82s)]
*  What's interesting to me is normally the older, highly successful Eric Schmitz have [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1978.66s)]
*  all the money and the young people have all the brain power. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1984.6200000000001s)]
*  Here, the young people have the brain power and now they suddenly have a lot of money [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1988.6200000000001s)]
*  too. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1991.42s)]
*  That's a new thing in the world as well. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1992.42s)]
*  It'll be interesting to try. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1994.14s)]
*  Speaking about brain power and money, Masa-san, one of the old guard investors, has pitched [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=1995.14s)]
*  a trillion dollars. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2002.5s)]
*  He wants to replicate Shenzhen's scale within the US. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2004.58s)]
*  Let's take a listen to this video. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2010.54s)]
*  Talking about one trillion dollars worth of investment out of SoftBank, but then the context [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2011.8999999999999s)]
*  for us. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2016.98s)]
*  One trillion dollars and he wants to recreate a kind of Shenzhen in the US, potentially [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2017.98s)]
*  alongside TSMC, of course, the Foundry and, of course, Samsung as well. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2022.98s)]
*  You'd imagine that OpenAI would have a piece to play as would ARM as well that is moving [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2028.34s)]
*  into data centers, into their CPUs aligning with AI accelerators. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2033.02s)]
*  It hits that and it ticks that box in terms of Trump's ambitions, but we do need to find [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2037.26s)]
*  out where the capital is coming from, where the spending is coming from and whether indeed [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2041.3400000000001s)]

*  actually to operate them as well, which has been a constraint and a bottleneck in the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2048.26s)]
*  US. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2050.94s)]

*  Oh, really? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2056.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, years ago. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2057.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2059.26s)]
*  I mean, it's changed in the last five years. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2060.26s)]
*  I was there between 2014 and 2019 and it was an incredible hotbed. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2063.14s)]
*  It was an engine of innovation. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2071.1800000000003s)]
*  The mindset there was 996 was the best lifestyle you could have, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2074.1800000000003s)]
*  a week. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2081.78s)]
*  People talk about trying to replicate stuff. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2084.3s)]
*  There was a lot of entrepreneurs creating very new ideas out of there, but it was basically [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2086.2200000000003s)]
*  a convergent mecca for technology. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2092.62s)]
*  The idea that Masa-san wants to rebuild that here in the US, I find that fascinating. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2096.14s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2101.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think part of that vision doesn't align. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2102.5s)]
*  When we were at OpenAI, one of the questions I was asking Dee Scully is the talent pool, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2105.7799999999997s)]
*  the computer science talent pool in Boston is about 20 times bigger than in Silicon Valley [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2111.06s)]
*  and it's also not nearly as picked over. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2114.86s)]
*  Why doesn't OpenAI open an office in Kendall Square just like Google did and Microsoft [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2116.68s)]
*  did? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2121.14s)]
*  The answer is, yeah, we would do that except the timeline to AGI is so short that we're [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2122.14s)]
*  going to have a multi-billion dollar or multi-billion person AI workforce before we could even finish [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2127.1s)]
*  the building and populate it. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2132.5s)]
*  That's a pretty interesting insight. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2134.98s)]
*  Then you're like, okay, well, Shenzhen, that's a huge number of people, buildings, but is [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2138.3799999999997s)]
*  that timeline going to line up with the Elon Musk video that we saw a minute ago? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2143.2999999999997s)]
*  I think the constraints here are electrical power and chips and not so much building a [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2150.02s)]
*  huge city that's all working on it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2156.7s)]
*  It's the 60s, buddy. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2159.46s)]

*  building something with AGI or AI that's groundbreaking. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2216.7s)]
*  They see a company like this thriving and hitting a huge valuation. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2221.14s)]
*  Also, back when this happened in the internet era, you got huge valuations, but the companies [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2226.22s)]

*  These companies, $500 million of revenue, the margins on that must be astronomical. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2234.54s)]
*  They're raising a lot of money at a big valuation, greater than $10 billionish. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2240.54s)]
*  But they can actually operate profitably on one day's notice if they want to because they're [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2246.9s)]
*  not headcount intensive. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2251.2999999999997s)]
*  These are like the best companies financially that we've ever seen in history and then the [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2252.2999999999997s)]
*  timelines are just laughable. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2256.7s)]
*  Two years to get to $500 million of revenue. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2258.7s)]
*  How many Cursors are out there in the next couple of years? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2261.14s)]
*  Dozens. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2264.4199999999996s)]
*  Dozens. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2265.4199999999996s)]
*  It's actually constrained by the number of teams, not by the number of opportunities. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2266.4199999999996s)]
*  It's fascinating, right? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2269.06s)]
*  We've got constraints on electricity, on chips, and on the smartest entrepreneurs who take [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2270.06s)]
*  this forward. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2275.2599999999998s)]
*  At least for the moment, it's humans that are constraining. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2276.2599999999998s)]
*  The difference in the vibe around Boston versus any time I've ever seen is just so blatantly [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2280.8999999999996s)]
*  obvious and palpable. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2287.16s)]
*  You just need to walk around. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2288.2799999999997s)]
*  But everywhere you go, everyone's just talking about Scale AI, talking about Cursor. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2290.18s)]
*  These are their fellow alumni that they actually knew. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2295.64s)]
*  The jealousy factor is a great motivator. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2299.72s)]
*  It's really an amazing time. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2301.8599999999997s)]
*  Salim, these are all exponential organizations. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2303.3199999999997s)]
*  All EXOs. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2307.3999999999996s)]
*  They have an MTP. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2308.3999999999996s)]
*  They're using community effectively. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2310.44s)]
*  They're building developer communities. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2312.7599999999998s)]
*  The engagement levels are really great. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2316.16s)]
*  They've gamified in many cases what they're trying to do. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2319.08s)]
*  It's phenomenal to watch. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2322.6s)]
*  We predicted this in the book. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2324.2s)]
*  We said we're going to have just a continuing increase in the velocity and scale and speed. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2325.8799999999997s)]
*  This is surprising even to us at some level because the speed of 500 million ARR in this [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2332.24s)]
*  time scale is just unbelievable. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2338.74s)]
*  I do agree with Dave. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2341.0s)]
*  There's a lot more coming down the pike on this. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2342.0s)]
*  These curves are just going to get more and more vertical. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2345.02s)]
*  The teams is a really intriguing problem. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2348.74s)]
*  How do you find the right teams? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2351.5s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could use an AI solution to find teams that can then be put together [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2352.5s)]
*  and thrown together for this. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2358.06s)]
*  That would be a really interesting problem. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2359.42s)]
*  Dave, can you do that? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2360.78s)]
*  One of our billion-dollar investments is Mercor. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2362.2599999999998s)]
*  That is all about finding and hiring. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2366.78s)]
*  Is that for the general employee? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2371.1s)]
*  What are the attributes of the founding team that you're looking for? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2374.74s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2379.5s)]
*  We study that all the time. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2382.2999999999997s)]
*  We quote the Fred Wilson rule a lot. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2384.8199999999997s)]
*  We call it the Fred Wilson rule. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2386.9799999999996s)]
*  Fred didn't call it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2387.9799999999996s)]
*  He's the Union Square Ventures founder, MIT alum, most successful venture capitalist of [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2388.9799999999996s)]
*  all time, numerically. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2393.08s)]
*  He keeps a low profile so we don't talk about him every day, but Fred Wilson is really a [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2394.08s)]
*  god of the industry. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2398.02s)]
*  What he says as he gets older is, I always invest in teams of three or more best friends [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2401.06s)]
*  who write the code themselves, meaning they're technical, they're really technical, all three [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2405.9s)]
*  of them or more, and I trust them. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2409.38s)]
*  If they pass those three filters, I invest even if it's the stupidest idea in the world [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2412.54s)]
*  because they'll change the idea much more quickly. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2415.94s)]
*  You can't change friendships. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2418.42s)]
*  You can't change relationships. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2419.54s)]
*  You can't change yourself overnight, but you can change your idea overnight. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2420.7799999999997s)]
*  Once you get them into an ecosystem of other people that have great ideas, take them out [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2424.66s)]
*  to Silicon Valley, introduce them to Eric Brynjolfsson, take them to HAI, take them [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2428.94s)]
*  over to OpenAI headquarters, run them through Google. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2432.94s)]
*  We're doing all that with these teams now. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2435.66s)]
*  Then they come back home and they're enlightened and they always have good ideas at the end [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2437.3s)]
*  of that road trip. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2441.06s)]
*  Let me hit on one of the points there. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2442.06s)]
*  People say, why should they be best friends? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2444.38s)]
*  Why should they be around, having had a relationship for a number of years? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2447.26s)]
*  We just saw these large companies like Meta and Google and OpenAI are just rating companies [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2450.7400000000002s)]
*  and stripping out the talent. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2458.74s)]
*  If you've started a company with some stranger that you don't know and it's been six months [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2461.4199999999996s)]
*  and someone gives you a huge signing bonus, you're going to leave. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2467.54s)]
*  If you've started a company with your best friends and you've got long history, you're [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2471.58s)]
*  not going to abandon them. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2474.66s)]
*  I think that's a really critical point. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2476.06s)]
*  That's the number one failure mode actually for companies is that somebody bails because [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2478.1s)]
*  you'll always succeed in the end if you stick with it. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2484.1s)]
*  The way you characterize it is exactly right. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2487.5s)]
*  You'll pivot a dozen times and you'll look. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2490.02s)]
*  Name any one of these companies that didn't pivot at least once. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2492.82s)]
*  Going back to PayPal and every one of them pivots at least once. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2495.62s)]
*  That's just part of the journey. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2500.1s)]
*  When you pivot and then someone says, oh, I give up, I'm leaving, that's what ends up [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2502.08s)]
*  killing the company. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2505.7s)]
*  Also, the way I've been phrasing it for many, many years is more true than ever before. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2506.9s)]
*  Imagine that you're on an international flight and you're sitting right next to somebody [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2512.38s)]
*  in a middle seat. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2515.9s)]
*  The way you feel when you get off that flight, that's the way it's going to feel when you're [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2517.98s)]
*  doing a startup together. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2521.54s)]
*  If it's you and me and Salim flying, we're going to come off that plane energized because [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2524.1800000000003s)]
*  we've been talking about everything in the world for hours, like eight, 10, 12 hours. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2528.1s)]
*  Not only that, we'll have infected the three rows around us to all get into a conversation. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2532.3s)]
*  Walk out with more employees than you started with. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2539.1800000000003s)]
*  Salim, when we had Singularity University's graduate studies program, the GSP going, and [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2541.7000000000003s)]
*  we were starting companies that had a 10 to the ninth plus mission, impact a billion people [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2548.1800000000003s)]
*  over a decade. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2553.86s)]
*  We were starting companies that was around the same exact timeframe that Y Combinator [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2554.86s)]
*  was getting going. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2559.6200000000003s)]
*  The failure mode, I think, was that we thrust 100 alpha males and females into a room, independent [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2560.6200000000003s)]
*  of each other, and said, start a company. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2569.46s)]
*  That was very different than Y Combinator, where teams came in with an idea already. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2572.1s)]
*  That glue pre-existing with something that they're all passionate about, I think, is [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2578.06s)]
*  a super differentiator for investments. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2584.1s)]
*  If you look at the track record, the ones that did succeed were the ones that became [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2587.2200000000003s)]
*  friends and stuck together over time. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2590.7400000000002s)]
*  The one thing we did do was created lasting friendships that were lifetime long. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2594.38s)]
*  If you look back, a lot of those alumni have gone and started working together where they [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2599.7400000000002s)]
*  found affinity, not necessarily on the teams. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2605.1800000000003s)]
*  That team formation is a critical one, and that early chemistry is really important. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2607.7000000000003s)]
*  I remember this whole conversation reminds me of Yossi Vardi, who single-handedly created [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2611.26s)]
*  the Israeli startup scene. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2615.82s)]
*  He sold ICQ, then became AOL Instant Messenger for half a billion dollars back in the 80s. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2617.94s)]
*  He did something amazing. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2624.5800000000004s)]
*  He basically went to founders in Israel and said, if you're a good guy and you have integrity, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2625.62s)]
*  I'm giving you 50k, that's the bar. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2631.5s)]
*  Then he just trusted them. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2635.06s)]
*  He would check their integrity and their character very carefully, and then he'd just give them [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2636.42s)]
*  money. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2639.9s)]
*  He invested in something like 400 startups. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2640.9s)]
*  The outcome of those has been a little bit like the Fred Wilson type, where it's just [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2644.18s)]
*  been off the hook. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2647.02s)]
*  The team and the individual that you're betting on is everything in this type of world. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2648.74s)]
*  Salim, you're so right. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2652.7799999999997s)]
*  You reminded me of something that's really, really important. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2654.1s)]
*  Peter, remember when we went over to Israel, to Tel Aviv, to Startup Nation, to try and [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2655.8599999999997s)]
*  figure out why the startup success rate is five times higher there than anywhere else [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2659.5s)]
*  on the world per capita, than anywhere else in the world? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2664.8199999999997s)]
*  There are a lot of reasons, but a lot of it comes back to everyone has to do their military [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2668.4199999999996s)]
*  time and there's a huge amount of bonding, just marching through the desert together [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2671.22s)]

*  Why would you? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2708.06s)]
*  When you're there, it has an immense amount of bonding. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2709.94s)]
*  Part of it is because the way it's set up with the living groups and the fraternities [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2714.38s)]
*  and sororities. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2717.1s)]
*  Part of it is because the school is so freaking hard. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2718.46s)]

*  fun bonding culture? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2763.9s)]
*  One of our Harvard guys in the lab decided he was going to open a window and do a rock [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2766.58s)]

*  Dave, why are the cops all over the building? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2780.82s)]
*  I said, guys, let them be. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2782.94s)]
*  This is what they need. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2786.5s)]
*  They need to bond. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2787.94s)]
*  They need to blow off steam. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2789.1800000000003s)]
*  They need to be a little crazy. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2790.1800000000003s)]
*  This is what's going to create the success in the long run. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2791.1800000000003s)]
*  We also can't have the cops here every day, but this is the culture that is ultimately [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2793.38s)]
*  going to thrive because it's kind of lacking on the Harvard campus and they need to create [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2798.02s)]
*  it. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2802.1800000000003s)]
*  So they are self-creating it. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2803.1800000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2804.9s)]
*  This next slide from Andreessen Horowitz is pretty epic. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2805.9s)]
*  It's labeled, what's working means in the era of AI apps. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2809.98s)]
*  Gen AI startups are shattering growth records. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2814.54s)]
*  Dave, this must make you feel pretty amazing. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2817.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this chart's a little hard to read, but if you look at the top quartile, it looks [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2821.5s)]
*  like they raised less money, but they actually raised it much more quickly. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2825.14s)]
*  If you look in the bottom right corner, pre-series A dollars raised, 3.1 million. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2827.7s)]
*  That means they were very, very capital efficient getting to 8.7 million in revenue run rates. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2831.74s)]
*  So this is what I was saying earlier. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2836.8999999999996s)]
*  The fundamentals of these companies are so good compared to the internet era. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2838.54s)]
*  Very capital efficient, great ARR, and this is accelerating really quickly now. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2843.18s)]
*  Did you see that one of our companies, Farsight, was talking to JP Morgan as a customer and [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2848.66s)]
*  nothing was happening for months, just unresponsive. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2854.46s)]
*  Then Jamie Dimon sent an email to everyone in the entire company, every manager saying, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2857.4199999999996s)]
*  if someone is trying to sell you AI, you better buy it or at least listen right now because [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2862.46s)]
*  this is going to... [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2867.1s)]
*  And all of a sudden they called back. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2868.1s)]
*  JP Morgan actually reached out to Farsight and says, okay, we want to talk. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2870.18s)]
*  Get over here right now. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2873.22s)]
*  So that's going to happen now across most of the Fortune 500, all of the mid-market. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2874.98s)]
*  So this will get even more traction very quickly now. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2880.56s)]
*  These numbers are extraordinary. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2884.06s)]
*  ARR, 8.7 million, time to a series A in five months. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2886.1s)]
*  Extraordinary. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2895.1s)]
*  Those are crazy good numbers, but then look at the cursor number from the prior slide, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2896.1s)]
*  500 million in two years. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2899.46s)]
*  It makes things look weak, right? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2901.46s)]
*  Look at the bottom quartile there, right? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2904.94s)]
*  They reached 10 million in series A and in six months or 12 months, they've brought back [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2906.94s)]
*  a third of it. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2912.7s)]
*  That's still an amazing number. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2913.7s)]
*  It's a great point, Salim. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2915.82s)]
*  Yeah, 3 million in 12 months would have been top decile a couple of years ago. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2916.82s)]
*  Here it's bottom quartile. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2921.34s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2922.34s)]
*  Yeah, an acceleration of the acceleration. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2923.54s)]
*  Here's a big story in AI this past week. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2927.94s)]
*  The Trump administration is launching AI.gov. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2931.34s)]
*  They're hoping to launch it on July 4th. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2934.94s)]
*  I hope they hit it. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2936.7400000000002s)]
*  And I just want to dig into this a little bit for those who've been frustrated by the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2938.94s)]
*  government. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2945.86s)]
*  This is a project being led by a Tesla engineer by the name of Thomas Shedd, who's leading [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2946.86s)]
*  the team. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2952.06s)]
*  And the idea is can the government use AI across federal agencies, the GSA, DOT, FDA, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2953.42s)]
*  DOE, FAA, all these agencies, which have been sub-linear in their existence at best? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2961.86s)]
*  And let's chat a little bit about this. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2969.9s)]
*  So GSA, which is General Services Administration, it buys everything for the government. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2971.74s)]
*  They could use AI to optimize procurement, get vendor performance, automate contract [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2978.2599999999998s)]
*  analysis, really eliminate fraud. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2984.38s)]
*  DOT is going to be predicting flight delays, analyzing real-time vehicle data, helping [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2988.14s)]
*  support infrastructure like roads and bridges in advance. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2993.62s)]
*  It would be great if they could predict where the potholes are and get those fixed. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=2996.8199999999997s)]
*  DOE about optimizing grid ops, forecasting demand and supply. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3001.54s)]
*  The FAA, we're going to see a story on this about automated drone traffic management, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3007.62s)]
*  weather avoidance. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3013.2999999999997s)]
*  As a pilot, the FAA's air traffic control system is a bloody 1950s mess. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3014.98s)]
*  And then of course, we've spoken about the FDA using AI to enhance drug device approvals, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3024.34s)]
*  faster clinical protocols, optimizing food safety. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3031.94s)]
*  I mean, if there's one part of the world that needs optimization with AI, it's the government. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3036.42s)]
*  Thoughts, John? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3042.42s)]
*  You have a great roadmap for how this works too. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3043.54s)]
*  I think Palantir and AWS, because everyone was worried about how is the government going [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3045.82s)]
*  to interact with cloud computing? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3050.82s)]
*  There's a huge privacy issue here. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3052.2200000000003s)]
*  Is the government going to start building their own data centers and build their own [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3054.7000000000003s)]
*  cloud? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3057.1s)]
*  And obviously, they don't know how to do that. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3058.1s)]
*  So then Palantir and AWS set up secure clouds, private clouds for the government, and that [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3059.36s)]
*  became the roadmap. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3064.82s)]
*  So now with AI, it's like, well, I obviously can't take all my government documents, tax [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3066.1s)]
*  returns and everything and dump them into Gemini or into chat GPT. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3070.46s)]
*  How's that going to work? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3074.42s)]
*  So now if AI companies are smart. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3075.54s)]
*  Just explain to people why you shouldn't do that, why you can't do that. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3076.54s)]
*  Well first of all, there's no compartmentalization. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3080.78s)]
*  So it gets pulled into the training data with everything else. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3082.7400000000002s)]
*  Everyone asking about what times a soccer game gets pulled in with someone's tax return [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3085.26s)]
*  goes into the training data. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3088.42s)]
*  Then somebody else who queries chat GPT says, hey, what did Peter Diamandis' taxes look [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3089.78s)]
*  like? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3093.54s)]
*  And it just answers. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3094.54s)]
*  So that's not going to work. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3095.54s)]
*  So yeah, all kinds of concerns like that. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3097.1s)]
*  It's going to be figured out in the private sector and it's going to be sold to the government [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3099.7799999999997s)]
*  as compartmentalized AI modules. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3103.2599999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of questions around whether departments can pool information and share [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3107.18s)]
*  their AI. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3111.3399999999997s)]
*  So those are really tricky conversations, but I guarantee none of the ideas are going [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3112.62s)]
*  to come from the government out. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3116.54s)]
*  What will happen is mandates will come out. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3118.62s)]
*  It's what the state of New York just did. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3120.5s)]
*  The governor of New York said, you know what, we need a gigawatt of nuclear power. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3122.46s)]
*  Okay, any ideas on how to do that? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3126.02s)]
*  No. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3128.46s)]
*  Just say and make it happen. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3129.54s)]
*  And then every private sector genius can propose a way to do it and then they'll just approve [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3131.42s)]
*  one of them and that's how it'll happen. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3135.38s)]
*  So the same will happen with AI here. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3136.66s)]
*  So hopefully the big AI companies are aggressive in building up their government services operations [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3138.5s)]
*  or they bless some other third party like a Palantir type or a new startup to go and [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3142.82s)]
*  become that entity. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3149.42s)]
*  But that's the only way this can actually happen. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3151.1s)]
*  And God knows we desperately need it, right? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3153.58s)]
*  AI can solve so many government problems so quickly. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3155.38s)]
*  Salim, you've been working with governments around the world with your EXO hat on. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3159.02s)]
*  Speak to this please. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3164.1800000000003s)]
*  I have so much to say here. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3165.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, three quick points. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3166.94s)]
*  One, note that most government processes are prescriptive and the many of a prescriptive [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3168.46s)]
*  repetitive process, you can apply AI to it and totally change the game. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3173.6200000000003s)]
*  So I think that's a huge area. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3176.94s)]
*  Second, about a few years ago, I was asked to give a talk at the Republican National [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3179.1400000000003s)]
*  Leadership Convention and the title of my talk was going to be How do you drop the cost [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3184.74s)]
*  of government by 10x? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3188.9399999999996s)]
*  And you could do it easily using some of these technologies, blockchain, AI, etc. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3190.8599999999997s)]
*  The third point, I'll give a specific example. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3195.8199999999997s)]
*  If you were applying for a wind turbine approval in I think it was in Colorado, it was taking [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3198.54s)]
*  like two years or three years to get approval for that, right? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3204.1s)]
*  And then they brought in a programmer who put in a Google Maps, where are the electrical [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3207.2599999999998s)]
*  mains, where are the water mains, what are the flight paths, and they were able to reduce [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3212.78s)]
*  that two-year approval time to 30 seconds. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3216.86s)]
*  And that's just the smallest example of how you can do this across the board. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3219.38s)]
*  And we've mentioned some of these already. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3223.9s)]
*  It's going to be a game changer. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3225.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm so excited about the potential government applications of this. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3227.62s)]
*  I love it. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3230.9s)]
*  I love it. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3231.9s)]
*  And it is. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3232.9s)]
*  A quick aside, you've probably heard me speaking about fountain life before and you're probably [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3233.9s)]
*  wishing, Peter, would you please stop talking about fountain life? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3237.62s)]
*  The answer is no, I won't. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3240.94s)]
*  Because genuinely, we're living through a healthcare crisis. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3242.6600000000003s)]
*  You may not know this, but 70% of heart attacks have no precinct, no pain, no shortness of [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3245.94s)]
*  breath, and half of those people with a heart attack never wake up. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3250.1800000000003s)]
*  You don't feel cancer until stage three or stage four, until it's too late. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3253.86s)]
*  But we have all the technology required to detect and prevent these diseases early at [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3258.46s)]
*  scale. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3263.34s)]
*  That's why a group of us, including Tony Robbins, Bill Kaap, and Bob Haruri founded [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3264.34s)]
*  Fountain Life, a one stop center to help people understand what's going on inside their [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3268.26s)]
*  bodies before it's too late and to gain access to the therapeutics to give them decades of [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3273.0600000000004s)]

*  Go to fountainlife.com slash Peter and tell them Peter sent you. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3281.94s)]
*  OK, back to the episode. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3286.1800000000003s)]
*  Here's a related story. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3288.6600000000003s)]
*  The US Army appoints Palantir Meta Open AI execs as Lieutenant Colonels. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3291.0600000000004s)]
*  This is a special unit created to support the government. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3297.24s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3301.52s)]
*  I'm going to give some names here because they were published. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3302.52s)]
*  The appointees include the Palantir CTO, Shyam Sankar, Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, Kevin [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3307.04s)]
*  Weil, the Open AI's Chief Product Officer. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3317.3599999999997s)]
*  Kevin's going to be joining us on this podcast in the next one. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3320.64s)]
*  I cannot wait for that. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3323.8399999999997s)]
*  Dave, you and I had an amazing meeting with Kevin up at Open AI headquarters and then [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3326.3599999999997s)]
*  Bob McGrew, former Open AI Chief Revenue Research Officer. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3330.24s)]
*  I find this absolutely fascinating. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3336.44s)]
*  Sort of indoctrinating and actually they made it super fast. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3340.0s)]
*  There's no required traditional training, no boot camp for these individuals. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3346.6s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3355.48s)]
*  Peter, you didn't read the quote there, the backlash quote. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3356.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3359.72s)]
*  The appointment of Lieutenant Colonel in the US Army followed the creation of a special [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3360.72s)]
*  unit created for rich big tech mavens seeking military leadership roles. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3366.4s)]
*  This is exactly what you're always saying. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3372.72s)]
*  Everything turns into a drama, whether it needs to be or not. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3376.88s)]
*  That's just the nature of social media. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3379.4s)]
*  This is one way that the government can bring in extraordinary intelligence that they could [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3381.68s)]
*  never hire, they could never recruit otherwise. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3386.04s)]
*  This is sort of a part-time military service to make sure that the US government and the [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3390.04s)]
*  US military have access to the brightest minds. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3393.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3397.12s)]
*  I don't know the other guys personally, but Kevin Weil we know. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3398.7999999999997s)]
*  He's a sweetheart guy, brilliant. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3401.7599999999998s)]
*  A perfect guy. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3403.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3404.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3405.6s)]
*  Is somebody going to just naturally join the army as a private, work their way up and end [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3406.6s)]
*  up being aware of how to use AI to solve government and military issues? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3410.84s)]
*  No, that's not likely to happen. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3414.76s)]
*  So go get the best guy on the planet. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3417.04s)]
*  He's absolutely the right guy. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3419.92s)]
*  He's a physically impressive manager. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3423.28s)]
*  He can actually move mountains while still being the nicest, sweetest guy on the planet. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3426.52s)]
*  He knows exactly how this stuff works. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3431.2000000000003s)]
*  This is just great for everybody. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3432.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3434.36s)]
*  The negative spin here is nutty. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3435.36s)]
*  I think this is a great example of a human being plus AI because as they bring AI to [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3437.7599999999998s)]
*  help in these roles, it's going to be totally transformative. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3442.52s)]
*  You of course have the monster immune system response with people going, well, you can't [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3445.56s)]
*  do that unless you've worked your way through the ranks, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3449.64s)]
*  People have a thing. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3453.0s)]
*  But I think this is a great application. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3454.3599999999997s)]
*  This reminds me of the big problem around leadership training. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3457.8799999999997s)]
*  We've spent decades and dozens of hundreds and thousands of books written on leadership [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3463.76s)]
*  training and then about a few years ago it turned out the best leadership training in [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3468.92s)]
*  the world was World of Warcraft. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3472.2400000000002s)]
*  The fact that technology can outstrip this age-old human institution is unbelievable, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3476.0800000000004s)]
*  but it's there. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3481.96s)]
*  I think that added to what these guys can do plus bringing technology and their mindset [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3483.2000000000003s)]
*  to the mix. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3487.6400000000003s)]
*  This is where I think it'll have the biggest impact because they'll bring that mindset [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3488.6400000000003s)]
*  and hopefully infect the rest of the armed forces with it. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3492.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3495.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3496.56s)]
*  Talking about breakthroughs in AI, I love this. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3497.56s)]
*  My hats off to DeepMind continuing to push new capabilities out that support all of humanity. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3500.8399999999997s)]
*  This is a DeepMind algorithm supporting better tropical predictions for cyclones. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3508.52s)]
*  Let me just play the video here. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3515.2799999999997s)]
*  It's no sound, but let me give the data. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3518.24s)]
*  It's a five-day track prediction that averaged 140 kilometers closer to the actual storm [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3523.0s)]
*  path. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3529.48s)]
*  It's the difference between hitting Florida and Georgia or Virginia. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3530.48s)]
*  This was trained on 5,000 cyclones over 45 years. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3536.6800000000003s)]
*  Here are the numbers on impact. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3541.8s)]
*  There's about $1.4 trillion in economic losses for cyclones over 50 years and I'm excited [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3543.84s)]
*  about this. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3550.6000000000004s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3551.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3552.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3553.88s)]
*  I mean, there's a piece of AI folklore called the bitter lesson. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3554.88s)]
*  Basically, any time you throw a lot of data and a lot of compute at one of these algorithms, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3560.08s)]
*  you're likely to get a great outcome. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3565.2s)]
*  You can sit there and stare at a wall trying to think through how to do it with differential [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3567.2s)]
*  equations for three years. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3569.96s)]
*  You're not going to compete with the big data approach. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3571.2s)]
*  This is a great case study. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3573.24s)]
*  I'll bet the people working on this got it cranked out in a very short period of time [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3575.16s)]
*  with just a couple of people, yet it's far more effective than anything that's been [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3578.36s)]
*  done over 50 years of weather research. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3582.6s)]
*  There's so many of these around. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3585.04s)]
*  The benefit to humanity, if we coordinate it and wrangle it correctly, is just immeasurable [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3588.04s)]
*  and is a great example. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3593.88s)]
*  Salim, what are your thoughts here? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3595.36s)]
*  I label this as nothing to see here and I don't mean that in a negative way. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3597.6400000000003s)]
*  This kind of thing should be completely expected. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3604.52s)]
*  You take an ancient data set where we have human beings trying to hand plot these things [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3607.48s)]
*  which are never going to do that well. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3611.4s)]
*  Now you throw AI at it plus the rich data set that's very bounded and we know exactly [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3613.8s)]
*  the history. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3619.4s)]
*  Of course it's going to come out with a much better thing. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3620.68s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3622.96s)]
*  Thank God because look at the predictive ability now going forward. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3623.96s)]
*  Huge impact, but I think we should take this as we should expect like a thousand of these [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3628.32s)]
*  coming out in the next year or two or three. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3632.08s)]
*  I agree. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3634.36s)]
*  I've created great XPRIZES as well and I've been pushing for this. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3635.36s)]
*  I think DeepMind is an extraordinary company under Dimas and Sabis and they're creating [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3639.28s)]
*  these kinds of assets to support humanity is really in their DNA, in their culture. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3644.76s)]
*  I can't wait for an XPRIZE or an earthquake prediction algorithm. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3650.84s)]
*  If you could predict an earthquake with a instead of like 30 seconds or a minute with [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3656.56s)]
*  or 30 minutes getting people into safety would be huge. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3662.48s)]
*  I mean one of the interesting... [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3667.2400000000002s)]
*  Can I just drill in on that? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3668.7200000000003s)]
*  That's a perfect example. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3670.12s)]
*  Like we know animals can sense this. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3672.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3673.96s)]
*  The data is there. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3674.96s)]
*  The data is there. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3675.96s)]
*  We just have to get the right kind of algorithmic approach to it and that's an area where I [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3676.96s)]
*  would expect to see a breakthrough in something like that. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3679.84s)]
*  And then when it happens everybody's going to go, oh my God, this is unbelievable. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3683.6s)]
*  But we should expect things like this. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3686.4s)]
*  In fact, we should take areas and go find them, find areas where we have... [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3688.3599999999997s)]
*  We know what the answer could be. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3692.4199999999996s)]
*  We know definitively it's possible and then put AI against that. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3694.14s)]
*  Yeah, my guess is we'll see earthquake prediction algorithms within the next few years if not [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3698.4399999999996s)]
*  sooner. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3703.64s)]
*  Here's an interesting controversial thought on this. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3704.64s)]
*  Imagine if you could control the direction of a hurricane. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3709.3599999999997s)]
*  So instead of having it hit Miami, you steer it down into Central America. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3714.3s)]
*  You go, oh my God, why would you possibly do that? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3721.1800000000003s)]
*  That's terrible. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3723.46s)]
*  Well, so if you hit Miami and the cost of the impact there is $50 billion for that and [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3724.46s)]
*  the government of Costa Rica says, listen, you pay us $20 billion and you can land the [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3736.0600000000004s)]
*  hurricane here. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3743.74s)]
*  An interesting arbitrage on geography. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3746.22s)]
*  A crazy idea. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3748.14s)]
*  We have people to control the path of these things. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3750.02s)]
*  Do you know the mechanism that they'd use for that? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3753.14s)]
*  Butterflies? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3755.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, butterfly effect. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3756.9399999999996s)]
*  I think you'd use lasers and heating the atmosphere. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3761.58s)]
*  Maybe it's magic Voodoo dust. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3765.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3768.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I can just see the other side of that coin, right? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3769.3399999999997s)]
*  Hey, Mr. Trinidad, maybe you want to pay us some money so that we make sure that hurricane [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3772.58s)]
*  doesn't hit you and you get into all sorts of crazy outcomes. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3776.98s)]
*  But if you can measure it, you can impact it. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3781.34s)]
*  And I find this again, huge and interesting implications. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3783.94s)]
*  Our next story here comes from Mattel and OpenAI. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3789.1s)]
*  They've announced a strategic collaboration. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3793.2599999999998s)]
*  I've talked about this forever. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3797.46s)]
*  Super excited. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3799.62s)]
*  Your toys are going to become super intelligent with GPT-5. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3801.18s)]
*  So your Barbie doll, your Hot Wheels, your American Girl. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3805.54s)]
*  I know that, Salim, that you in particular like the American Girl dolls. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3809.4199999999996s)]
*  Thomas and friends. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3813.4199999999996s)]
*  Sorry, buddy. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3814.4199999999996s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3815.4199999999996s)]
*  You've uncovered my deep secret. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3816.4199999999996s)]
*  I think this is going to be a boom for the toy companies. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3821.14s)]
*  I mean, this is going to enable rapid, you know, early education of our kids. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3824.7s)]
*  That's the area I'm really excited about because the feedback loop as you have interaction [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3831.82s)]
*  with these toys, you'll learn a lot about the child and we can use that too for understanding [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3835.86s)]
*  learning behavior, guardrails that you could implement where their motivations are. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3841.22s)]
*  I think it's so exciting because we'll get more data about young children than we could [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3846.82s)]
*  ever gotten before. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3851.22s)]
*  I was a little surprised OpenAI wanted to touch this one. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3852.8999999999996s)]
*  It's really clear when you're talking to the AI voices now that they're, within a year, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3857.14s)]
*  going to be just crazy engaging, super, super friendly and a lot of kids are going to prefer [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3861.74s)]
*  talking to AI all day than talking to real friends. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3866.2599999999998s)]
*  And you know, there's good and bad that comes along with that. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3869.66s)]
*  I kind of, I've loved every minute of raising my kids and I hate to see that change in any [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3872.3799999999997s)]
*  way, but it's clearly coming soon and it's inevitable. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3878.3s)]
*  The other part Dave is sparking their kids imagination, right? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3881.5400000000004s)]
*  When you're, when you have to make up what your Ken doll or Barbie doll is saying, that's [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3886.1400000000003s)]
*  critical for fostering early curiosity in the imagination. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3892.5s)]
*  It is. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3896.78s)]
*  And you have the echo chamber risk on the other side of that. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3897.78s)]
*  So if it's done right, it's an educational gold mine and the kids are happy and you know, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3900.78s)]
*  a lot of schools are terrible. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3906.86s)]
*  So you're alleviating a lot of that. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3908.6200000000003s)]
*  So if it's done right, it's incredible. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3911.5400000000004s)]
*  If it becomes an echo chamber, then you know, you can see where it can go bad in a real [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3913.1800000000003s)]
*  hurry too. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3918.1400000000003s)]
*  That's why I'm surprised OpenAI wants to touch it because when you start talking about kids, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3919.1400000000003s)]
*  you really got, you cannot make a mistake, right? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3923.1000000000004s)]
*  You got to get it right. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3925.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3926.34s)]
*  There was a friend of mine that had a product called Moxie, which was an AI robot and it [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3927.34s)]
*  was mostly being used for young kids with educational challenges, right? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3933.1s)]
*  Neurodiverse kids, in which case, you know, creating a best friend and helping them open [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3939.18s)]
*  up and communicate. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3944.14s)]
*  There's real value there. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3945.8199999999997s)]
*  What happened with your AI enabled Chucky? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3946.8199999999997s)]
*  That would be interesting. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3949.8199999999997s)]
*  A whole new set of movies coming out. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3952.8199999999997s)]
*  All right, let's jump into a little bit of AI and education. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3955.7799999999997s)]
*  These are some scary reports that came out. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3960.66s)]
*  So this is in Time Magazine, chat GPT, maybe eroding critical thinking skills according [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3962.58s)]
*  to a new MIT study. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3967.98s)]
*  Dave, did you track this? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3969.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, only because you put it in the slides. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3971.7s)]
*  I said, I better understand what's going on here. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3973.8199999999997s)]
*  It sounds really, really important. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3975.94s)]
*  So I dug up the research and read it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3977.1s)]
*  And it's nothing surprising if you think about how Waze works, right? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3981.3399999999997s)]
*  A lot of people don't know how to drive anywhere unless they turn on Waze, like places they [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3984.74s)]
*  go every day. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3988.26s)]
*  They still could not get there without turning on Waze. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3989.26s)]
*  It becomes a crutch really, really quickly. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3991.6600000000003s)]
*  So that's what's happening here with writing, you know, where you would have thought through [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3993.5400000000004s)]
*  all the underlying topics in order to write it because the AI is filling in the blind [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=3996.86s)]
*  spots. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4001.0200000000004s)]
*  You just don't really understand what you just wrote. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4002.0200000000004s)]
*  But it's not at all surprising. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4005.4s)]
*  When you write it up and put it in a headline, it opens your mind to what's going on. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4008.98s)]
*  But when you read the paper, you're like, oh, duh, of course, this is exactly how it's [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4013.1400000000003s)]
*  going to work. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4016.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, this is some of the data. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4017.06s)]
*  I don't know if you want to use this to recount what the study said. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4018.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, no, it's really straightforward. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4024.14s)]
*  If you write a document yourself and you have to think through every single word of it, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4027.46s)]
*  that time that you put in means you can then recount what you just wrote with incredible [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4032.1s)]
*  accuracy. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4037.42s)]
*  So the failure rate on the top line shows your quoting accuracy of what you were just [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4038.68s)]
*  talking about. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4043.38s)]
*  So if you use AI to write the same paper and then you immediately ask you, hey, what was [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4044.38s)]
*  Shakespeare's favorite toy? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4049.0s)]
*  Like, I have no idea. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4050.5s)]
*  Well, you just wrote it down. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4052.06s)]
*  Like, oh, did I? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4053.06s)]
*  Yeah, so that's the difference there. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4054.06s)]
*  83% failure rate if you use chat GPT versus 11% if you're using Google, meaning you're [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4056.06s)]
*  actually looking up the data, then you're composing it. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4061.54s)]
*  I mean, when you're doing the writing, you're doing the research and doing the writing, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4064.62s)]
*  training your own neural net and the data is being deposited in your brain. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4069.62s)]
*  It is scary. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4077.8599999999997s)]
*  It's going to become a crutch in terms of thinking and it's going to get a lot worse. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4079.2599999999998s)]
*  I didn't read it as all bad, though. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4085.98s)]
*  I think that you got the work done 100 times faster in the left column. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4087.58s)]
*  So your neural net actually didn't have time to retain every little detail even if, I don't [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4096.1s)]
*  know, if society is going to move 100 times faster, we're not going to retain every detail. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4101.58s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4105.18s)]
*  So yes, as a teacher, you could say, look, the kids are not really learning this stuff. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4106.660000000001s)]
*  But as a person moving through life, the kids are covering a lot more terrain. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4112.3s)]
*  Isn't that more important? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4115.900000000001s)]
*  So it's a mixed bag. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4117.54s)]
*  It's not all bad. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4119.700000000001s)]
*  Salim, good or bad? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4120.700000000001s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4121.700000000001s)]
*  80-20 approach, 80% unnerved, 20% will navigate this. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4122.7s)]
*  So the 80% is, I actually saw this with Milan, my 13-year-old. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4128.5s)]
*  He was writing an essay and he just used Chats-Upt to write the essay. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4132.94s)]
*  And he clearly had no memory of that essay. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4136.22s)]
*  He would have fallen completely into these buckets. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4137.78s)]
*  And so when I saw this slide, I was like, whoa, this reminds me completely of what Milan [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4140.46s)]
*  just went through. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4145.179999999999s)]
*  And he has no cognitive framing for what he wrote in that essay because he used the AI [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4146.26s)]
*  to help. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4151.3s)]
*  Now, the other side of it is that it's happening much faster, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4153.18s)]
*  I think the key question is, how do you effectively train kids on critical thinking into the future? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4156.9800000000005s)]
*  And a guest we might want to think about is Nicole Dreiske, who's actually solved this [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4162.820000000001s)]
*  problem and has found a way of teaching critical thinking into kids in a very active and a [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4166.46s)]
*  very accelerated way compared to where we do it. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4171.5s)]
*  The last point I'll make is that I remember seeing a study that 52% of the CEOs in Silicon [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4174.5s)]
*  Valley are liberal arts majors, which is the ability to think in different ways is a critical [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4179.54s)]
*  factor of success in leading a tech company. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4186.54s)]
*  And that's really, I find that really interesting. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4188.38s)]
*  Paul Graham has a different spin on that, that the liberal arts majors succeeding is [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4190.14s)]
*  more tied to their desire to not do irrelevant, difficult things and get to important topics. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4195.38s)]
*  And it's just an easier way to get through. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4202.14s)]
*  It's a good filter. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4204.34s)]
*  It's a good filter. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4205.34s)]
*  It's a good filter anyway, yeah. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4206.34s)]
*  Dave or Suleiman, I don't know if you saw Andrei Karpathe's presentation at the AI [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4207.82s)]
*  Startup School. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4212.22s)]
*  I showed it to my son, Jet, yesterday trying to incentivize him about vibe coding, which [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4213.22s)]
*  Andrei came up with. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4220.9400000000005s)]
*  He put out the tweet that went viral defining vibe coding. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4222.1s)]
*  And my son's reaction was, I want to learn how to code, not just vibe code. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4227.58s)]
*  So I'm curious what you think about that. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4233.82s)]
*  The concept right now is English is the new coding language. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4236.54s)]
*  But there's a lot of value in fundamental coding. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4240.5s)]
*  So what are your thoughts, Dave? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4243.62s)]
*  Oh my God, so many thoughts on this. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4245.219999999999s)]
*  I have a little story, amazing experience this week. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4246.98s)]
*  I don't know if you want to hear it. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4249.339999999999s)]
*  I do want to hear it. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4251.82s)]
*  Of course I do. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4252.82s)]
*  You do want to hear it? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4253.82s)]
*  It's incredible to me. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4254.82s)]
*  You remember right when I got out of MIT, went to MicroStrategy, came back to Boston, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4255.82s)]
*  started my first company, DataSage. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4258.78s)]
*  Our very first product was using neural networks for handwriting recognition. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4260.74s)]
*  So I took the back prop algorithm, read the raw research paper, all the differential equations, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4265.26s)]
*  said I got to try and code this up on real world hardware in assembly language. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4269.58s)]
*  From the day I started on that journey until we productized it was four years of coding. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4273.5s)]
*  And then that turned into a few million of revenue and then we just skyrocketed from [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4279.9800000000005s)]
*  there. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4282.740000000001s)]
*  Well then a billion dollar exit. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4283.740000000001s)]
*  Did you say you got it up in assembly? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4284.740000000001s)]
*  Well we had to because we started out in a high level language, but you needed to squeeze [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4288.38s)]
*  every mip, every flop out of these processors to build anything scalable enough to work. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4293.9s)]
*  So we invented quantization, which is now all the rage to try and shrink the parameter [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4299.0199999999995s)]
*  size, anything to get another 2x performance out of these things just to make it work in [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4303.66s)]
*  a real world use case. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4308.0199999999995s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4309.0199999999995s)]
*  And so it's a lot of hard work. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4310.0199999999995s)]
*  So then this week on Monday I said I wonder how long it would take me to recreate that [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4311.0199999999995s)]
*  four years of work. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4315.66s)]
*  And so no joke, I'm absolutely not exaggerating. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4318.82s)]
*  It took less than an hour to vibe code it from scratch to the exact same, even the demo, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4321.76s)]
*  the demo graphical interface I put on it, vibe coded the entire thing in under an hour. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4327.72s)]
*  Now it's not entirely apples to apples because there's a ton of open source out there that [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4332.64s)]
*  the vibe coding can pull in. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4337.08s)]
*  So just to be fair, but in terms of getting the job done. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4339.04s)]
*  The broader point is well made though. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4342.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, four years down to an hour is just mind blowing what you can do. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4344.16s)]
*  Now your son is exactly right. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4348.4s)]
*  Spend some time looking at the code, writing some raw code. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4350.719999999999s)]
*  You don't realize how much faster you are until you try and do it the old way. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4354.48s)]
*  And so it's really, really important to get that experience. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4359.16s)]
*  So let me give you the end of this. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4362.12s)]
*  He went off and wrote a short story, kind of full without any help, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4364.04s)]
*  And it was mind bogglingly good. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4369.879999999999s)]
*  I couldn't believe that. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4373.0s)]
*  I thought he used an AI to write the short story, but it was really, really good. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4374.2s)]
*  I think we're in this golden era. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4378.04s)]
*  Like right now, the AI can do almost anything for you, but it's not creative yet. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4380.24s)]
*  And so you still have to think, the human component is still by far the most component. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4385.0s)]
*  And I don't know if that period of time will last forever, but right here, right now, such [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4388.64s)]
*  a golden era where you're empowered, but not demoralized or crushed. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4392.72s)]
*  It's just such a wonderful next couple of years and you really got to take advantage [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4399.44s)]
*  of it. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4403.2s)]
*  Next topic here is AI and job loss. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4404.2s)]
*  This was a Stanford survey revealing which jobs AI would most likely replace. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4408.28s)]
*  They surveyed 1,500 workers and AI experts. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4413.96s)]
*  69.4% want AI to quote, let me focus on high value work, unquote. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4417.8s)]
*  And 46.6% wanted to take on repetitive junk. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4424.5599999999995s)]
*  That's kind of obvious. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4428.96s)]
*  We'll put this study in the show notes, but here's the occupations most likely be automated. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4431.32s)]
*  No news here. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4438.16s)]
*  Bookkeepers, payroll clerks, data entry, insurance claim processors, software roles, tax preparers, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4439.16s)]
*  public safety telecom. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4447.5599999999995s)]
*  Dave, Salim, any thoughts? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4448.92s)]
*  Well high level thought is, look, everybody needs to become a user of AI to get ahead [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4452.719999999999s)]
*  of this. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4456.2s)]
*  The study would say, wow, it looks like bricklayers are going to be immune for a while, but you're [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4457.84s)]
*  not going to go and become a bricklayer just because you got three more years of, it doesn't [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4462.84s)]
*  really give you any actionable. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4467.44s)]
*  Robots are coming for that job too. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4468.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4471.5599999999995s)]
*  So don't do that. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4472.5599999999995s)]
*  Just start using it every day, understand it and ride the wave. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4474.84s)]
*  Let's double down on that. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4478.92s)]
*  If you're listening to this podcast and AI sounds fascinating, you're not a power user, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4479.92s)]
*  how do you start? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4486.72s)]
*  Salim, what do you start with? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4487.72s)]
*  Oh, just take a task that you're trying to do and go AI, how would I do that task? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4490.280000000001s)]
*  And then say, do it for me and give it the raw data and watch it just go. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4495.0s)]
*  It's pretty much is that easy. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4499.68s)]
*  And I love the point you made Dave earlier, which is I do use chat GPT voice interface. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4502.08s)]
*  And when I'm doing my red light therapy or taking a sauna, whatever the case might be [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4509.04s)]
*  I'm having a conversation on whatever subject is I'm curious about. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4514.0s)]
*  And it's extraordinarily educational and fun to have this back and forth with an AI saying, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4519.08s)]
*  well, I don't understand that term, could you dive in or what's the data that backs [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4524.679999999999s)]
*  it up or when did that happen? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4528.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, just being able to have a continuous, it's what a childlike memory or experience [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4530.44s)]
*  of why, why, why digging deeper. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4537.8s)]
*  That's exactly what you should do. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4541.08s)]
*  And get out of the media rut. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4542.72s)]
*  I know Peter, you say this a lot, but we have the internet now. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4544.08s)]
*  You can actually watch useful media like this or study KJ Harderich and his podcast. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4548.32s)]
*  He's phenomenal. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4555.28s)]
*  Watch Lex Friedman, watch Dworkish Patel. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4557.44s)]
*  But while you're doing it, if you don't understand anything, have either Gemini 2.5 Pro or chat [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4560.48s)]
*  GPT 4 open and just talk to it while you're listening to the podcast. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4564.68s)]
*  Stay out of the mainstream media. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4569.8s)]
*  Do not listen to the rock stars, sports broadcasting, whatever. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4571.400000000001s)]
*  It's going to distract you and suck you in. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4576.68s)]
*  You need that time back and use that time this way. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4578.16s)]
*  Once you're into it, it's just as much fun, but much more useful. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4581.84s)]
*  Can I make a couple of points about that last line? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4585.4800000000005s)]
*  Of course. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4587.52s)]
*  Let's note that a lot of those roles are being done because people have to do them, not because [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4588.52s)]
*  they want to do them. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4593.4400000000005s)]
*  It's grunt work done repetitively, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4595.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a perfect area. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4599.44s)]
*  I was really happy to see that a large number of folks, 40% said, I want to take all the [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4600.719999999999s)]
*  repetitive tasks because nobody wants to be doing that anyway. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4606.0s)]
*  And now we can automate a lot of that side of it. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4608.839999999999s)]
*  And just a quick point on the bricklaying thing. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4611.919999999999s)]
*  I remember showing a drone at Singularity University a few years ago where you had drones [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4613.96s)]
*  working in cohesion to lay bricks on the wall. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4618.16s)]
*  And the drones did it in no time flat because we know exactly where the bricks need to be [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4620.759999999999s)]
*  laid. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4626.639999999999s)]
*  It's totally prescriptive. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4627.639999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4628.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4629.64s)]
*  This is a story from The Guardian, Amazon testing humanoid robots to deliver packages. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4630.64s)]
*  Took them long enough, right? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4635.280000000001s)]
*  We see in the image here Agility's Digit robot. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4638.04s)]
*  I'm going to have the CEO of Agility at the Abundance Summit with their robots. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4641.6s)]
*  Actually, I'm going to have four or five robot companies at the Abundance Summit in March [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4646.360000000001s)]

*  I was a little alarmed when you read, it's going to spring out of the van. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4656.68s)]
*  That's going to be a little unnerving. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4660.6s)]
*  My two dogs are already freaked out by the postman. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4662.76s)]
*  What the hell did I do? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4666.4800000000005s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4667.4800000000005s)]
*  We're going to have autonomous vans driving around where robots do the last 10 meters [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4668.4800000000005s)]
*  of delivery to your doorstep. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4673.240000000001s)]
*  And it's just going to drop the cost of this. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4676.72s)]
*  So we're going to see drone delivery of products. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4678.240000000001s)]
*  We're going to see autonomous van and robot delivery of products. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4681.4400000000005s)]
*  This is happening. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4685.16s)]
*  I have no question about it. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4686.16s)]
*  It's a when, not an if. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4687.16s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4689.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4690.2s)]
*  And so the question is when. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4691.2s)]
*  When do you predict, Salim? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4692.48s)]
*  I'd say middle of next year because the technology is all there. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4695.24s)]
*  They just have to get there. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4697.8s)]
*  There's probably some regulatory stuff to get through which might slow it down. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4698.8s)]
*  But the technology's potential is now there now. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4701.68s)]
*  Yeah, the technology is there. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4705.0s)]
*  I think the humanoids are inspiring everybody. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4706.5599999999995s)]
*  There's no surprise here. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4709.599999999999s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4710.96s)]
*  People don't talk about as much as the robotics that are doing nanosurgery, microsurgery are [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4711.96s)]
*  unbelievable. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4715.4s)]
*  And also the robots that are crawling through pipes, cleaning things, you know, getting [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4716.96s)]
*  into sewer systems. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4720.24s)]
*  Those are also taking off. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4721.719999999999s)]
*  They're not as sexy as the humanoids. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4723.04s)]
*  But it's all happening concurrently. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4725.719999999999s)]
*  And it's just, you know, tremendous benefit for humanity. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4727.12s)]
*  Yeah, I want to make a point about humanoid robots. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4730.2s)]
*  You know, we've had this long discussion. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4733.16s)]
*  I'm tired of your pointer, maybe. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4735.96s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4737.96s)]
*  I thought of a great real world example of my octopus idea, which is which is you've [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4740.04s)]
*  got a human robot. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4745.64s)]
*  How many times when you're doing something, do you wish you had a third arm to hold the [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4746.8s)]
*  garbage bag open or whatever? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4749.88s)]
*  So can we please have these humanoid robots have three arms? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4752.0s)]
*  No, we'll just have two robots with four arms. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4754.92s)]
*  Anyway, so but here's interesting, right? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4758.44s)]
*  We're going to see these companies stack resources. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4760.8s)]
*  So you know, I would not be surprised to see Tesla get into delivery services, right? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4764.12s)]
*  With autonomous vehicles and autonomous robots. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4769.32s)]
*  We'll see obviously here Amazon and agility. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4772.44s)]
*  We'll see other companies coming together on this, but a full stack in the physical [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4776.96s)]
*  world. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4782.679999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about robotaxis. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4785.12s)]
*  Big news since we spoke last on June 22nd, the Tesla robotaxi launched in Austin with [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4787.08s)]
*  a flat fee of $4.20. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4796.4s)]
*  Elon loves his 420 over and over again. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4799.679999999999s)]
*  So robotaxi is now live. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4803.2s)]
*  Here is Elon at Tesla headquarters in Austin. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4806.28s)]
*  And here's a quick video of what a fan had an experience in the robotaxi. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4811.04s)]
*  Thoughts? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4822.32s)]
*  Finally, he's done it. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4823.4s)]
*  I mean, I think it's the biggest one of the biggest markets that Tesla is going to experience. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4824.52s)]
*  We've seen Kathy Wood predict as a multi-trillion dollar marketplace. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4829.92s)]
*  Tesla will have been known as a car manufacturer. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4835.120000000001s)]
*  It will be known as a humanoid robot and autonomous robotaxi service delivery company. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4839.320000000001s)]
*  Thoughts, gentlemen? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4847.72s)]
*  So two quick thoughts. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4849.76s)]
*  One is never bet against Elon. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4850.96s)]
*  I've learned that to my massive investment portfolio suffering over the last decade. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4853.2s)]
*  I think the second observation is these cars are technologically quite inferior to the [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4859.4s)]
*  Google Waymo taxis because they don't operate in heavy rain. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4867.08s)]
*  They're limited by human level site. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4871.16s)]
*  And that's a problem, I think, in the long term. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4873.68s)]
*  He may get some buzz out of it, but he's going to have to upgrade the lidar for this to be [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4876.48s)]
*  really well developed. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4880.0s)]
*  We'll talk about that. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4880.8s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4882.28s)]
*  Let me just step on the other side of that. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4883.28s)]
*  He could just be waiting for lidar systems and all that. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4885.04s)]
*  The cost curve becomes cheap enough and then you just flip over to that. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4887.48s)]
*  Well, you know his thesis, right? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4890.719999999999s)]
*  If a human driver can drive with just his or her eyes, in fact, with one human eye, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4892.28s)]
*  then from first principle thinking, an autonomous car should be able to drive with a couple [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4899.48s)]
*  of cameras. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4904.36s)]
*  And that's his basic thesis. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4905.44s)]
*  That's great, except lidar can see five cars ahead. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4907.12s)]
*  So you can break that argument up. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4909.88s)]
*  Why not give it superhuman skills? [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4911.84s)]
*  Why not give it superhuman skills? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4913.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4914.32s)]
*  You can do it. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4915.32s)]
*  Why not do it? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4916.32s)]
*  And yes, it's much more expensive for now. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4917.32s)]
*  I think he went down a philosophical route of going away from lidar and I think you end [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4918.32s)]
*  up with an inferior product. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4924.28s)]
*  But if it's workable and it works well enough, that's fine. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4926.04s)]
*  I mean, listen, I drive with my Tesla's autonomous mode all the time and it does perfect. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4929.0s)]
*  The only time it ever stops working is when it catches me picking up my phone and looking [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4936.44s)]
*  at it and then it beeps at me. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4941.799999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, it's extraordinary. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4943.48s)]
*  In the rain... [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4945.12s)]
*  That part surprised me actually. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4946.12s)]
*  I didn't know when we were driving together a couple of weeks ago, the inward facing camera [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4947.12s)]
*  is new to me. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4951.16s)]
*  It's like actually watching your behavior and then adjusting. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4952.16s)]
*  I was like, wow, that's a little weird. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4955.0s)]
*  If I'm looking out the window to the left, it sort of like beeps at me. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4956.44s)]
*  If I pick up my phone, it beeps at me. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4959.32s)]
*  It's like really annoying. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4961.24s)]
*  I've kept my 2017 Tesla Model S for exactly that reason. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4963.44s)]
*  There's no inward camera, so it's great. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4967.679999999999s)]
*  I've now driven that car just to flip to the other side of this. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4969.679999999999s)]
*  I've now driven that car four times up and down the country from Miami to New York or [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4972.839999999999s)]
*  Toronto. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4977.639999999999s)]
*  So I've become a bit of an expert at the highway driving. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4979.04s)]
*  Have you heard about airplanes, Salim? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4981.04s)]
*  Have you heard about this thing called an airplane? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4982.719999999999s)]
*  You know what? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4984.12s)]
*  I load up with five of my favorite shawarma kebabs. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4985.12s)]
*  I arrange 40 conference calls. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4987.2s)]
*  The car drives itself 80% of the time and it's free to do that. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4989.0s)]
*  I arrived more refreshed than when I left. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4993.92s)]
*  I mean, it's phenomenal. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4995.88s)]
*  All right. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4996.88s)]
*  Let's take a look at this next one. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4997.88s)]
*  So Tesla faces protests in Austin over Musk's robo taxi plans. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=4999.12s)]
*  Protesters claim Tesla's FSD, full self-driving, has been linked to hundreds of crashes, including [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5004.36s)]
*  dozens of fatalities. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5010.42s)]
*  So let's look at the data here one second. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5013.26s)]
*  Here it is, number of accidents per million miles. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5017.28s)]
*  And without any question, listen, humans are terrible drivers. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5021.48s)]
*  We are distracted constantly now with at least one cell phone per car. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5027.04s)]
*  We are terrible control systems for two ton cars going at high speed. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5032.08s)]
*  Can I throw out a quick data point here? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5035.44s)]
*  Sure. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5037.84s)]
*  About in 2011, I think it was, there was a three-day outage in Blackberry services around [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5038.84s)]
*  the world. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5042.759999999999s)]
*  Nobody could send text messages for three days. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5043.759999999999s)]
*  The accident rate in Abu Dhabi dropped 40% during that three days. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5045.72s)]
*  That was then. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5049.8s)]
*  Today you look at anybody driving, they're looking at their phone. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5050.8s)]
*  We absolutely should not be driving as human beings. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5053.360000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5055.88s)]
*  I mean, we're going to see an extraordinary increase in safety. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5056.88s)]
*  I mean, just the idea of a 16 or 17-year-old driving a couple of ton vehicle at 60 miles [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5060.360000000001s)]
*  per hour through the streets with very little experience and their phone distracting them [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5067.84s)]
*  should scare the daylight out of everybody. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5072.68s)]
*  Well, this is America's greatest Achilles heel actually is that we're responsive to [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5075.44s)]
*  sympathetic stories that are statistically rounding errors. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5081.64s)]
*  Or wrong. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5085.92s)]
*  Or wrong. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5086.92s)]
*  Or wrong, yeah. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5087.92s)]
*  Well, look at the State of the Union address. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5088.92s)]
*  Somewhere along the way it changed to, let me call out four or five people in the crowd [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5093.08s)]
*  here and tell their personal stories. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5096.76s)]
*  You're like, well, how do I know if that's just like, that could be one in a trillion [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5098.6s)]
*  for all I know. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5102.4s)]
*  But yeah, that's okay. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5103.4s)]
*  I'm just trying to sway a bunch of voters toward what I'm trying to get done here. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5104.4s)]
*  But we're ridiculously swayed by that. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5107.839999999999s)]
*  If you look at that prior slide, yes, hundreds of fatalities from self-driving. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5110.839999999999s)]
*  Well, hundreds relative to what? [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5115.44s)]
*  And you put your statistician hat on, you're like, this is clearly better. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5118.48s)]
*  But some of these are really, really tragic. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5122.719999999999s)]
*  And if it's all captured on video, which everything is now, it can sway opinion. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5125.2s)]
*  And this is where, if America is going to lose to China or to some other state, it's [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5129.68s)]
*  going to be for this reason. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5136.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same concept when people hear about an airplane accident, oh my god, I'm [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5138.240000000001s)]
*  fearful of flying. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5143.76s)]
*  It's like, have you looked at the accident rates in cars? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5145.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, flying is still the safest mode of transportation. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5149.16s)]
*  1.2 million people a year die in car accidents around the world every year. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5152.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5156.400000000001s)]
*  Nuclear power, we'll come to that later, I guess. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5157.5599999999995s)]
*  But that's another case study. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5160.16s)]
*  We will. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5161.36s)]
*  So here's an important news bite from this past month here in LA. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5162.36s)]
*  Five Waymo vehicles were torched in downtown LA. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5168.839999999999s)]
*  Waymo paused service in LA, limited San Francisco, Austin, Phoenix, Atlanta. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5172.96s)]
*  And the question is, is this the beginning of the Luddite revolt? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5178.759999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5183.5199999999995s)]
*  So are people responding against all of the technology? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5184.84s)]
*  And here's an image of the Luddite revolution from 811 through 816. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5192.52s)]
*  And I have some data I want to share with you guys on this because I think it's worth [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5198.64s)]
*  noting and I want to talk about it. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5203.84s)]
*  So the Luddite revolt over that five-year period was a series of protests by English [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5205.280000000001s)]
*  textile workers against the mechanization of the Industrial Revolution, particularly [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5211.0s)]
*  against automated looms that threatened their jobs and wages. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5215.84s)]
*  Sounds familiar, right? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5220.16s)]
*  Named after the mythical Ned Luddite, the movement began in Nottingham and spread across [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5221.96s)]
*  the UK. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5226.44s)]
*  Workers fearing de-skilling and unemployment amid economic hardship from the Napoleonic [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5228.24s)]
*  Wars destroyed machines and organized raids at night. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5234.96s)]
*  The revolt involved thousands. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5239.56s)]
*  The British government deployed 12,000 troops to suppress it. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5242.360000000001s)]
*  Sounds familiar. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5246.04s)]
*  And here we go. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5247.76s)]
*  Quote, machine breaking became a capital crime in 1812, leading to 17 executions, dozens [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5248.76s)]
*  of hangings, and the movement was crushed by 1816. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5257.02s)]
*  Thoughts? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5262.52s)]
*  Salim? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5263.52s)]
*  Well, this is the classic immune system response, right? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5265.52s)]
*  In a slight twist, note, I note when I read this up, the Waymo cars were actually called [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5270.8s)]
*  to that spot so they could be attacked. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5275.8s)]
*  So the AI is watching those people carefully for future retribution. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5278.38s)]
*  But I think this is the general backlash of technology against society. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5282.280000000001s)]
*  What we don't understand, we fear, and what we fear, we get angry at and we try and destroy [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5287.4800000000005s)]
*  it. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5291.400000000001s)]
*  You should insert a picture of the picketers that are in front of OpenAI. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5293.08s)]
*  You know, the security guys have cleared them all out now, but if you pull one off the internet, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5296.08s)]
*  it's very Luddite revolt looking. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5299.48s)]
*  Yeah, and I think we are without question going to have a revolt. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5302.16s)]
*  How often and where against which companies? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5309.639999999999s)]
*  We haven't really started to see job displacement truly occur, but when it does hit, and I think [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5312.5599999999995s)]
*  we'll be seeing it significantly in the next two to three years until we figure it out [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5318.6s)]
*  on reskilling and other mechanisms. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5323.68s)]
*  Can I give the positive spin here? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5329.320000000001s)]
*  Of course, we have no more looms. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5332.0s)]
*  No, it's the fact that we've seen this kind of displacement fear throughout history and [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5335.64s)]
*  we always survive it very, very well. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5342.280000000001s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5343.96s)]
*  And on the reskilling, which everybody's like, oh my God, how are we going to reskill? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5345.200000000001s)]
*  Note that we have AI to help reskill everybody, right? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5348.36s)]
*  And so you can pick your passion and go, I want to be reskilled in that area and you'll [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5351.16s)]
*  get a really good potential work. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5355.36s)]
*  Note also that we're near full employment today and have been for a while, so we actually [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5359.0s)]
*  need a little bit more buffer in the labor market than we have today. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5362.88s)]
*  So those are my positive spins and I also understand the negative. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5368.44s)]
*  I am curious what rules and regulations the government will put forward. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5371.08s)]
*  I don't think it will become a capital crime. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5376.4s)]
*  I do think we'll see troops again deployed on things like this. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5378.88s)]
*  This was just arm the Waymo cars with little machine guns so they can defend themselves. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5383.639999999999s)]
*  Fight back. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5388.32s)]
*  This was a scary story. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5389.7s)]
*  Two children shot while in a Waymo here in Santa Monica at Second and Broadway. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5391.259999999999s)]
*  This is actually like probably a mile from my home. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5396.719999999999s)]
*  Two teens were shot in Armintarso, non-life threatening, now stable in hospitals. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5401.52s)]
*  I think violence against tech, I don't know if you remember all of the scooters here in [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5407.72s)]
*  Santa Monica, Salim, if you were here at that time. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5413.56s)]
*  And the scooters, people sort of raged against the scooters because they were blocking sidewalks. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5417.4800000000005s)]
*  They would like literally throw them into the middle of the street. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5422.040000000001s)]
*  They'd decapitate them. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5424.68s)]
*  I think we're going to see, when we see Waymo robots, or not Waymo robots, when we see optimist [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5426.5199999999995s)]
*  robots and figure robots on the streets, I think we're going to find them in various [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5431.5599999999995s)]
*  positions hanging from trees. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5436.88s)]
*  Thoughts here? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5441.32s)]
*  We are, but I think this is really just part of the shift. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5442.96s)]
*  I mean, they'll probably call the Waymo to try and get away and there was probably some [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5446.719999999999s)]
*  sort of gang violence involved in this, something like this. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5450.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5453.48s)]
*  Okay, this was the slide about Waymo versus Tesla. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5455.48s)]
*  And here's a tweet, the downfall of Waymo began yesterday. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5463.879999999999s)]
*  This was tweeted on June 23rd about the launch of Elon's Robo taxi. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5467.719999999999s)]
*  So people need to understand the Waymo car is not cheap. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5475.16s)]
*  It's a $200,000 vehicle. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5478.48s)]
*  It's got 29 cameras, five lidars, six radars versus the Robo taxi. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5480.32s)]
*  And Elon has held to his first principle thinking there shall only be cameras. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5486.44s)]
*  This would be a great Dave Salim bet. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5495.24s)]
*  Dave, do you have a particular preference on which one would win out of this? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5497.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5502.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5503.36s)]
*  Peter, you know this topic far, far better than I do. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5504.36s)]
*  My bet, knowing what I know, is that it'll be about a 70-30 split. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5508.44s)]
*  There's always two or three vendors in any given market in the US. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5514.4s)]
*  It always stabilizes at that for antitrust reasons. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5517.36s)]
*  Tesla will grab the lead now because they put a bigger investment into the neural chips. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5520.48s)]
*  On the other hand, Google's got incredible technology. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5527.719999999999s)]
*  But if I had to bet right now, I'd say 70% of the market goes to Tesla, 30% goes to Waymo. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5530.36s)]
*  It stabilizes. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5534.599999999999s)]
*  So I'm 50-50 because I always prefer better technology. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5536.16s)]
*  But you have the never bet against Elon problem on the other side. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5540.4s)]
*  You know, here's the issue. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5545.84s)]
*  It's a huge capital expense that Waymo will need to roll out to do this nationwide. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5548.68s)]
*  Elon's got a different option. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5555.88s)]
*  You buy a Model Y, you turn on self-driving, it drives you around, you're going on vacation [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5557.82s)]
*  for a week, you tell your car to go off and earn your revenue. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5564.16s)]
*  So basically, the CapEx is covered by the consumer and it becomes a revenue engine for [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5567.48s)]
*  you. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5573.32s)]
*  So you'll buy a couple of these and just have them go out there. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5574.32s)]
*  So he's going to populate millions of these cars across the country at no CapEx to himself. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5577.24s)]
*  So if you apply that model, which is essentially the EXO model, which is assets on demand, [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5582.68s)]
*  and you don't own your own assets and you let other people self-provision these assets, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5587.72s)]
*  that will win hands down because it'll scale much, much faster than Waymo trying to own [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5593.16s)]
*  its own car as it has to. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5597.8s)]
*  This is directly connected to our other side bet, which is, you remember last week, Elon [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5599.599999999999s)]
*  and Trump finally break up, now they'll hate each other forever. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5604.72s)]
*  I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5607.36s)]
*  One, this might be totally made up. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5609.44s)]
*  They might be just trying to make PR for themselves, wouldn't surprise me at all. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5612.639999999999s)]
*  But two, if it is real, which it probably is, they'll kiss and make up in no time. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5615.84s)]
*  That was my bet. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5619.84s)]
*  By the way, we'll have Anthony Scaramucci is going to join us back on this pod to talk [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5620.84s)]
*  about how the administration... [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5625.4800000000005s)]
*  He was eerily accurate last time when we, after inauguration, we asked him how long [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5628.04s)]
*  will his bromance last? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5633.08s)]
*  And he said, I think 30 Scaramucci's or something like that. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5634.08s)]
*  And it was really near or dead on almost to the day. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5637.68s)]
*  So we got to respect his views next time. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5640.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5643.56s)]
*  Well, look, the government needs space launches and Elon needs regulatory approval of that [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5644.56s)]
*  really good idea. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5649.4800000000005s)]
*  You buy your car and then you lease it back to be a robo taxi. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5651.12s)]
*  It's just a really good idea. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5654.24s)]
*  All right. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5655.24s)]
*  Let's hit a couple other quick ones. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5656.24s)]
*  This is flying cars and drones. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5657.839999999999s)]
*  We've seen the Trump sign an executive order on drones and flying cars and supersonics. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5662.04s)]
*  Really important for these drone systems to actually work. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5669.0s)]
*  You need to enable beyond visual line of sight mode. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5673.0s)]
*  And we're seeing the US government support five regional e-VTOL pilot programs. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5678.28s)]
*  Super excited about archery aviation here in LA to serve the Olympics in 2028. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5683.400000000001s)]
*  And the other point here is they're enabling supersonic travel by scrapping outdated overflight [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5689.04s)]
*  bands. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5693.6s)]
*  So, you know, the supersonic jets of the Concorde could not fly over the domestic US because [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5694.6s)]
*  the sonic boom and changing, providing FAA waivers, in particular because a number of [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5702.58s)]
*  companies have come up with mechanisms to actually avoid or absorb the sonic boom. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5711.66s)]
*  But this is going to accelerate aviation as it should. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5716.54s)]
*  I mean, there hasn't been that much change in aviation for the last 50 years. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5720.42s)]
*  It's been incredibly slow. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5723.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5726.34s)]
*  I was wondering if all the privatization of space travel was also going to lead to breakthrough [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5727.34s)]
*  for, you know, out of the atmosphere hypersonic travel. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5732.5s)]
*  Because, you know, I don't know if you remember Steve Kishi was working on that. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5736.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5740.02s)]
*  I know way too much about this. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5741.02s)]
*  It's just really tough. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5743.34s)]
*  I mean, the amount of energy and to build something that's going to go skip across the [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5745.34s)]
*  upper atmosphere. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5748.78s)]
*  And there have been many companies who have died on that mission statement and billions [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5749.78s)]
*  invested. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5757.18s)]
*  The closest thing right now is Starship going spaceport to spaceport, but it's still expensive. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5758.58s)]
*  Here another competitor we know about. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5767.14s)]
*  We know about three or four of the companies out there providing eVTOL services. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5770.0199999999995s)]
*  This is WISC. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5777.0s)]
*  It's been selected by Miami to launch in that location. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5778.24s)]
*  So watching out for WISC in Miami. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5783.3s)]
*  I don't know if we're going to talk about these eVTOL flying cars at all, Saleem, but [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5786.34s)]
*  they're coming. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5791.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, interesting is, you know, Dave, when we spoke to Eric Schmidt about this, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5792.9800000000005s)]
*  he was not a believer in eVTOLs. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5798.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5801.1s)]
*  I mean, I think it was a relative thing. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5802.1s)]
*  You know, there's so much change going on and so much of it is so impactful. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5806.3s)]
*  And I don't think it was like, yeah, I don't believe in this. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5810.58s)]
*  It was like, look, aviation, we have helicopters. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5814.78s)]
*  Now we're going to have four prop electronic versions of them. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5817.62s)]
*  So what? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5821.82s)]
*  Like, well, so what to me is that they're self-flying, self-driving. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5822.82s)]
*  That to me is really, really a big deal. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5827.22s)]
*  And they're much safer too. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5829.54s)]
*  So I do think it is a big deal. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5831.86s)]
*  But he's like, yeah, but relative to space and AI, is it a big deal? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5833.22s)]
*  And he was like, no, not really. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5839.22s)]
*  For me, this is one of the most exciting technologies we could have. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5841.1s)]
*  OK, can I explain why? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5845.58s)]
*  Sure. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5848.18s)]
*  But you're still driving your Tesla every place. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5849.18s)]
*  I am, but I just love it. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5851.22s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5852.900000000001s)]
*  I'm allowed to do that. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5853.900000000001s)]
*  By the way, I have a Porsche Macan Electric also. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5854.900000000001s)]
*  And it's like maybe the best car I've ever driven. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5858.18s)]
*  But it's not way, way better than my 2017 Model S. It's marginally better. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5861.06s)]
*  So that's really profound to say how much further ahead Tesla was than all the other [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5865.46s)]
*  carmakers in many, many areas. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5870.78s)]
*  But let me go back to e-vetails for a second. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5872.98s)]
*  OK, I think this totally changes the game. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5874.94s)]
*  Why? [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5877.62s)]
*  Because real estate that's hard to get to is priced very low and it's scarce. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5878.62s)]
*  And therefore, we pay a lot of money for that little waterfront property on a lake somewhere [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5886.9s)]
*  because there's not that many of them. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5893.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, now you can get to all sorts of places you can't get to by road. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5894.58s)]
*  It's going to make an abundance of a really beautiful plot high up on a mountainside that [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5898.18s)]
*  you can't get to by car. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5903.58s)]
*  Now that becomes a viable real estate and we turn real estate from a scarcity problem [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5905.22s)]
*  into an abundance problem. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5909.66s)]
*  And I think that's incredibly exciting for the future. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5911.26s)]
*  There's huge economic implications for this. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5914.62s)]
*  Not just to mention, many of us fly around a lot and how much of a nightmare is the damp [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5917.66s)]
*  commute into the city? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5922.740000000001s)]
*  And just having a drone corridor from Kennedy Airport into Manhattan would just change the [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5924.62s)]
*  game. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5929.9s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5930.9s)]
*  And that is coming. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5931.9s)]
*  We've seen this with Joby, with Archer, now with Wisk. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5933.66s)]
*  You're going to get commute from downtown Manhattan to JFK in one of these vehicles. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5936.38s)]
*  Right? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5943.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5944.86s)]
*  In Sao Paulo, it's two hours to get to the airport. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5945.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5946.86s)]
*  Sao Paulo, you... [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5947.86s)]
*  It's like a nightmare. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5948.86s)]
*  Helicopters are the only option you have if you've got the money. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5949.86s)]
*  And those are like not the safest. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5951.38s)]
*  So these are safe and solid and I think they've become really a big deal. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5953.08s)]
*  Tourism destinations, I mean the list just goes on of the broad effects this could have. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5958.64s)]
*  This is hugely exciting to me. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5962.5599999999995s)]
*  Every day I get the strangest compliment. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5964.88s)]
*  Someone will stop me and say, Peter, you have such nice skin. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5967.12s)]
*  Honestly, I never thought I'd hear that from anyone. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5970.6s)]
*  And honestly, I can't take the full credit. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5973.64s)]
*  All I do is use something called One Skin OS1 twice a day, every day. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5975.8s)]
*  The company is built by four brilliant PhD women who identified a peptide that effectively [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5980.68s)]
*  reverses the age of your skin. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5985.740000000001s)]
*  I love it. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5987.76s)]
*  And again, I use this twice a day, every day. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5988.76s)]
*  You can go to Oneskin.co and write Peter at checkout for a discount on the same product [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5991.92s)]
*  I use. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5996.8s)]
*  That's Oneskin.co and use the code Peter at checkout. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=5997.92s)]
*  All right, back to the episode. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6001.72s)]
*  I want to jump into the next subject, which is timely and critical, which is the demand [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6004.04s)]
*  for energy from AI systems. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6010.16s)]
*  And a little bit of a look at US versus China. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6012.44s)]
*  I think people need to understand we are going to become limited by power in our quest for [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6014.68s)]
*  digital super intelligence. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6022.64s)]
*  So how are we going to power this revolution? [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6025.64s)]
*  So China is rapidly scaling up on nuclear. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6027.72s)]
*  It's their equivalent of a Sputnik moment. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6033.52s)]
*  China aims to surpass the US by 2030 in nuclear. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6036.48s)]
*  The numbers are staggeringly incredibly pessimistic here. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6041.639999999999s)]
*  The US only added two reactors this century. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6048.04s)]
*  Two reactors over the last 25 years. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6052.88s)]
*  94 total in the US versus China's 58. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6056.4s)]
*  China is building a reactor every 52 months. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6060.799999999999s)]
*  The US licensing alone takes 10 to 12 years. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6065.24s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6069.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6070.92s)]
*  Yes, this is the reason I love doing this podcast. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6071.92s)]
*  I look forward to this so much because your team will dig up a topic that I really need [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6074.12s)]
*  to study and then it'll come into the deck. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6078.8s)]
*  I'm like, it's just so fascinating to me to dig in on these things. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6082.08s)]
*  And it's just so fun to talk about it. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6085.16s)]
*  A lot of these things like this are so obvious. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6089.36s)]
*  And this is America's Achilles heel. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6092.5599999999995s)]
*  We cannot act on long-term thinking and long-term investing. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6094.92s)]
*  Our investment cycle is three, four, five years at the most. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6098.52s)]
*  Our election cycle is eight years, four years or eight years. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6101.360000000001s)]
*  And we can't think about 10 years in the future. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6104.88s)]
*  And so it's killing us. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6108.4800000000005s)]
*  It's absolutely killing us. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6109.4800000000005s)]
*  But the data in these next couple of slides is mind-blowing. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6110.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we're going to talk about nuclear in a future podcast with some of the CEOs [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6112.96s)]
*  in these industries. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6118.96s)]
*  But Generation 1 nuclear power plants no longer exist. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6120.719999999999s)]
*  Generation 2 plants are still out there, including what we saw with Fukushima and Three Mile [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6125.88s)]
*  Island. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6132.8s)]
*  Those were the dangerous plants. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6133.8s)]
*  Generation 3 have been the plants that have been really manufactured over the last 30 [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6135.8s)]
*  years. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6140.719999999999s)]
*  And then Generation 4 are the plants that currently have been designed, are fail-safe. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6141.719999999999s)]
*  It's kind of nuclear plant. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6148.24s)]
*  I'd put in my backyard. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6149.48s)]
*  But the time frame for these plants, for developing them, is insanely long. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6151.639999999999s)]
*  We're talking like, if you wanted to start today, it would take you 10, 15 years. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6157.24s)]
*  And that's why Three Mile Island is being recommissioned because it's already approved [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6162.2s)]
*  from a government regulatory standpoint. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6168.719999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6170.32s)]
*  It is totally crazy. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6171.32s)]
*  William? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6172.879999999999s)]
*  I've got a... [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6173.879999999999s)]
*  I'm really, really angry about this one. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6174.879999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to be constructive here, but we know that solar scales. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6178.48s)]
*  China is going to have more solar than the entire... [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6182.879999999999s)]
*  That's our next topic here. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6185.839999999999s)]
*  Let's go to the next slide. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6186.839999999999s)]
*  Wait, Salim. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6187.839999999999s)]
*  Salim, you got muted here. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6188.839999999999s)]
*  You muted yourself. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6189.839999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you muted yourself or we muted you. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6190.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just really mad. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6193.839999999999s)]
*  That was perfect. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6194.839999999999s)]
*  I was going to swear and I thought I better cut off the mic before I swear. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6195.839999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6201.839999999999s)]
*  So here's... [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6202.839999999999s)]
*  I'll let you take the lead here. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6203.839999999999s)]
*  China is winning the race to become a Type 1 civilization. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6206.2s)]
*  In other words, a civilization that harnesses all the power hitting the earth and the sun. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6208.44s)]
*  By 2030, China will have the ability to build an entire US worth of power generation from [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6213.5199999999995s)]
*  solar and storage alone every single year. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6220.48s)]
*  Look at this chart, Salim. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6223.32s)]
*  Talk to us about this. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6224.32s)]
*  You go, Dave. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6225.32s)]
*  Let me just gather my thoughts. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6226.32s)]
*  This chart is... [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6228.32s)]
*  I added the gigawatt access on the left there because who the hell talks about terawatt [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6229.32s)]
*  hours per month? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6232.96s)]
*  What the hell is that metric? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6233.96s)]
*  But anyway, gigawatts is a better way to look at it. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6234.96s)]
*  But this is actually gigawatt actual utilization. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6237.4s)]
*  They actually created about 700 gigawatts of solar panels last year, 2024, and deployed [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6241.04s)]
*  250 gigawatts of peak capacity. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6248.96s)]
*  I mean, kilometer after... [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6252.24s)]
*  The hillsides covered with solar. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6254.76s)]
*  We covered that on a past podcast. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6257.66s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6259.4800000000005s)]
*  They're just rolling this out, building capacity and distribution. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6260.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6264.72s)]
*  I mean, just for context, the US total capacity energy production is 1.2 terawatts, so 1200 [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6265.72s)]
*  gigawatts. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6271.5199999999995s)]
*  And so, peak actual utilization is more like three quarters of a terawatt. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6272.5199999999995s)]
*  So you're like, yeah, half of what the US creates, they created in solar panels in 2024, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6279.0s)]
*  just solar panels in 2024. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6283.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6284.72s)]
*  Salim. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6285.72s)]
*  All right. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6286.72s)]
*  So they have an advantage because they've got all the rare earths and they can use those [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6287.72s)]
*  for solar panels and build out. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6290.48s)]
*  They're going to add more solar than the entire US energy output in a little while, so that's [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6293.44s)]
*  going to be crazy. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6298.36s)]
*  It blows my mind that we are putting restrictions and not extending tax credits for solar and [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6300.0199999999995s)]
*  other stuff here in this country. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6304.799999999999s)]
*  We need to unlock that in the biggest possible way and let private sector go nuts on this [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6306.48s)]
*  and put government subsidies there instead of government subsidies on oil, which is what [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6312.2s)]
*  we do today. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6315.96s)]
*  It's the stupidest energy policy we could possibly have. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6316.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm fine with all energy needs to be made available, but where do we invest [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6320.08s)]
*  on growth? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6326.0s)]
*  Solar is available today. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6328.84s)]
*  The numbers are, can I just share a couple of points here? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6331.12s)]
*  There's enough energy that hits the earth in one hour to provide the global energy needs [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6334.92s)]
*  of the entire year. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6343.0s)]
*  So one year worth of sun hitting the earth provides global needs for the entire year. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6345.64s)]
*  So here are some additional numbers. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6352.56s)]
*  Global solar capacity reached 1.1300 gigawatts by 2024. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6355.3s)]
*  About 1% of global energy need is being provided by solar. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6361.52s)]
*  It's estimated that if you cover just 0.1% of the earth, about 150,000 kilometers with [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6365.320000000001s)]
*  panels that would generate 200,000 terawatt hours annually, exceeding current demands. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6372.76s)]
*  So how big is 150,000 square kilometers? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6379.400000000001s)]
*  It's about the size of South Dakota. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6383.320000000001s)]
*  I've never been to South Dakota, but if it were covered by solar panels, it'd be giving [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6385.16s)]
*  us a huge amount of energy. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6391.16s)]
*  The problem with solar for data centers and AI fundamentally is the good thing about AI [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6394.16s)]
*  is you can move it to the power. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6398.4400000000005s)]
*  I love that. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6400.12s)]
*  That's a huge advantage. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6402.0s)]
*  The bad thing is you need those chips to be running 24 by 7. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6403.0s)]
*  They depreciate really, really quickly. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6406.4s)]
*  They're very expensive. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6407.88s)]
*  The chips cost 10 times more than the power. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6409.0599999999995s)]
*  You're not going to let them sit idle if it's raining out. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6411.16s)]
*  So solar has the horrible flaw of being intermittent. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6413.76s)]
*  And so it's really good if you can store it, but the cost of lithium to store the solar [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6418.5199999999995s)]
*  when it's cloudy and raining is about five times higher than the cost of the solar panels. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6425.68s)]
*  So if you want to become the world's first trillionaire, find a way to store huge amounts [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6430.2s)]
*  of energy cheaper. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6433.360000000001s)]
*  Here's the way, and we're going to be talking to Bill Gross, the CEO of Idealab, right? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6434.360000000001s)]
*  He's been using gravitational storage, which is, we'll talk about that, rather than storing [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6439.12s)]
*  into batteries, you use the energy during the day, a portion of energy, to move a large [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6444.6s)]
*  weight vertically. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6451.28s)]
*  This has been done with water for ages, but you move a large weight vertically, and then [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6452.96s)]
*  at night the weight gets pulled down by gravity and a generator generates electricity. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6458.68s)]
*  So it's efficient, it's available, and it works. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6464.76s)]
*  Can I throw out some thoughts here? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6468.28s)]
*  Sure. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6470.36s)]
*  So in 2016, we crossed an inflection point where it became cheaper to build a solar power [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6471.36s)]
*  generation facility than fossil fuel. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6478.12s)]
*  And almost all energy and generation since then has been solar because of that. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6480.74s)]
*  In 2019, we hit a more important inflection point, which is that it became cheaper to [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6486.74s)]
*  build solar than to build and run solar than it is to build, sorry, it became cheaper to [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6490.9s)]
*  build and run a solar facility than just run a fossil fuel facility. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6497.7s)]
*  So the capex and opex of solar are now cheaper than the opex of fossil fuels, right? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6502.0599999999995s)]
*  That's a crazy inflection point. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6507.54s)]
*  We don't ever need to build a fossil fuel thing again, we should just be building solar. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6509.099999999999s)]
*  The utility storage problem has been solved at scale, as you've said. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6513.66s)]
*  At large scale, this is very easy. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6518.74s)]
*  You just pump water up a hill to an artificial lake and use hydron at night on the way down, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6520.379999999999s)]
*  right? [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6524.46s)]
*  It's a little clunky, but it's very workable until battery technology or energy, of all [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6525.46s)]
*  types of stuff that Bill Gross is doing, comes along. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6529.259999999999s)]
*  So this is a really unknown problem. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6532.7s)]
*  We should be going full out for this. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6534.7s)]
*  I think it was 100 miles by 100 miles to power the whole of the US was Elon's calculation. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6537.3s)]
*  The one I saw was 2% of the Sahara covered with solar panels gives you enough power to [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6542.3s)]
*  cover the whole world's energy needs. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6547.38s)]
*  Distribution is a challenge, but just that visual is a really killer visual. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6550.06s)]
*  It's absurd that we're doing what we're doing. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6553.46s)]
*  Here's the chart that was posted. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6555.5s)]
*  Elon's tweet is, solar is 100% of energy long term, right? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6559.780000000001s)]
*  No question, this is what's going to drive humanity forward. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6565.18s)]
*  And here's a chart that basically reads, it took eight years for solar to go from 100 [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6569.42s)]
*  terawatt hours to 1,000 terawatt hours, and then just three years to go from 1,000 to [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6574.14s)]
*  2,000 terawatt hours. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6579.9400000000005s)]
*  You can see that super exponential growth curve, exceeding hydro, coal, gas, nuclear, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6581.1s)]
*  wind. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6587.5s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6588.5s)]
*  Yeah, I really feel like pumped hydro is very, very efficient, but you need about a length [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6589.5s)]
*  or a size of locked nest to move up about 300 meters and come back down to store enough [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6594.94s)]
*  energy to power a huge data center. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6599.5s)]
*  So that's a lot of water. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6601.62s)]
*  Bill Gross has solved that, right? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6603.98s)]
*  With these gravitational towers, basically you pump huge, you know, multi-ton bags of [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6605.62s)]
*  dirt up into like an elevator shaft into a large building or up the hillside if you're [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6612.7s)]
*  near a mountain. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6618.94s)]
*  And he's got this working today. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6621.139999999999s)]
*  He's got huge contracts. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6623.179999999999s)]
*  We'll be talking to him about that. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6624.34s)]
*  I think storage can be solved. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6625.9400000000005s)]
*  And I'm hoping, in fact, AI is going to help us with new technology for... [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6630.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6633.58s)]
*  You know, if you're a material scientist or a chemical engineer, I'm pretty sure with [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6635.38s)]
*  AI's help in a couple of years, or maybe even this year, come up with a reversible chemical [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6640.46s)]
*  reaction that's completely self-contained, that stores huge amounts of energy. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6645.860000000001s)]
*  Use the solar to drive the reaction one way, and then when it's cloudy, run the reaction [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6649.14s)]
*  in the opposite direction. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6653.26s)]
*  And if you come up with something that's, you know, 10, 20 times more energy dense than [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6655.1s)]
*  a lithium battery, which seems very viable, you're going to be a trillionaire. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6658.9400000000005s)]
*  So just figure that out. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6662.9400000000005s)]
*  Use AI to help. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6664.5s)]
*  A couple of years ago, we tried to design an XPRIZE around this, and the numbers were [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6665.5s)]
*  get off-grid storage 50 times cheaper than it is today, which is very viable. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6672.62s)]
*  Here's another tweet from Elon. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6679.54s)]
*  Solar power in China will exceed all sources of electricity combined in the US in three [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6680.86s)]
*  to four years. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6687.3s)]
*  It's a wake-up call. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6688.3s)]
*  China is going all in on energy production, and it's epic. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6692.02s)]
*  I have one more thing to say about this. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6698.82s)]
*  I think this China-US stuff is a little overhyped. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6701.86s)]
*  I don't think we'll have that much of a... [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6705.74s)]
*  I think it's a stocking board. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6707.98s)]
*  But I think it's a great... [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6710.0199999999995s)]
*  I agree. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6712.0199999999995s)]
*  But it's a great comparator. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6713.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't think there's real deep conflict there. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6714.62s)]
*  No, there's not. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6717.179999999999s)]
*  But what it does is it shows the US what is possible. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6718.78s)]
*  Yeah, and today's earlier point is this is a structural issue we have in the US where [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6721.42s)]
*  we have four-year election cycles, and we have no mechanism to look at 20 years and [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6727.9s)]
*  say, this is the water, healthcare, energy we need over a 20-year period. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6732.0599999999995s)]
*  We need to solve that structural issue. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6735.86s)]
*  And you know running our venture funds, you know this acutely, but you make an investment. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6736.94s)]
*  Investors want to see liquidity within four or five years. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6741.66s)]
*  They don't want their money to be sitting out there for 10 or 15 years. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6744.139999999999s)]
*  In China, they know they'll still be in power. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6747.42s)]
*  They think they'll still be in power 20 years from now. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6749.799999999999s)]
*  If you look at the date, they said, you know what? [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6751.82s)]
*  We need to be the world's biggest manufacturer of solar panels. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6753.66s)]
*  So it's about 2004 or 10 or somewhere around there. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6756.099999999999s)]
*  From that date, you have the factories up and running and you have the production. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6761.54s)]
*  And then also, you know, when there's a recession, you got to keep cranking. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6765.7s)]
*  So just keep the engine running because you know you've got a 20-year view, 30-year view. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6770.54s)]
*  We just can't do that structurally in the US. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6776.139999999999s)]
*  And that's why we get so far behind in nuclear and solar and some of the other long-term [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6780.099999999999s)]
*  trends. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6783.38s)]
*  And that is our fundamental Achilles heel. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6784.38s)]
*  Hey folks, Salim here. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6786.26s)]
*  Hope you're enjoying these podcasts and this one in particular was amazing. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6787.74s)]
*  If you want to hear more from me or get involved in our EXO ecosystem, on the 23rd of July, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6791.66s)]
*  we're doing a once a month workshop. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6796.34s)]
*  Tickets are $100. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6798.5s)]
*  We limit it to a few people to make sure it's intimate and proper and we go through the [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6800.139999999999s)]
*  EXO model. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6803.94s)]
*  What we do there is we basically show you how to take your organization and turn it [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6804.94s)]
*  into one of these hyper-growth AI type companies. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6809.099999999999s)]
*  And we've done this now for 10 years with thousands of companies. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6813.34s)]
*  Many of these use the model that we have called the exponential organizations model. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6816.94s)]
*  Peter and I co-authored the second edition a couple of years ago. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6821.02s)]
*  So it's $100, July 23rd. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6824.14s)]
*  Come along. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6826.900000000001s)]
*  It's the best $100 you'll spend. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6827.900000000001s)]
*  Link is below. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6829.18s)]
*  See you there. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6830.18s)]
*  All right. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6831.18s)]
*  Last subject for us gentlemen, crypto. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6832.18s)]
*  Always have to have a little crypto in the conversation. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6833.18s)]
*  We've seen Bitcoin over the last couple of weeks dip down below $100K and resurrect itself [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6835.18s)]
*  up to $107. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6841.820000000001s)]
*  Predictions, Salim, that I'm seeing still hold that we might see $200K by the end of [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6842.820000000001s)]
*  this year. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6848.42s)]
*  I still remain all in and massively enthusiastic. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6849.62s)]
*  Are you? [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6853.099999999999s)]
*  Big time. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6854.099999999999s)]
*  I heard Michael Saylor say Bitcoin will get to $21 million a Bitcoin. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6855.099999999999s)]
*  I'll be happy when it gets to a million a Bitcoin. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6860.82s)]
*  That'll be perfectly good enough, I think, for most people because that'll just put it [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6863.099999999999s)]
*  at the level of gold, which is infinitesimal anyway, as in terms of global asset class. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6866.42s)]
*  But I think there's a bunch of things happening that are making this move very huge, very, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6872.22s)]
*  that'll start to accelerate this. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6878.1s)]
*  I heard Freddie May and Fannie Mac are looking at or approving mortgages backed by Bitcoin. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6879.62s)]
*  That'll be a huge thing. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6884.06s)]
*  So it's starting to get systemic approval and then things go crazy. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6885.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6889.860000000001s)]
*  I love this. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6891.42s)]
*  This comes from our friend, Brian Armstrong at Coinbase, earn up to 4% Bitcoin back on [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6893.42s)]
*  every purchase with a new Coinbase OneCard. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6898.9800000000005s)]
*  I love this. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6903.18s)]
*  I'm going to switch over from my Amex to this. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6904.18s)]
*  How about you? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6906.14s)]
*  Big time. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6907.14s)]
*  Dave, thoughts? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6908.14s)]
*  I'm really excited about the next story, actually. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6909.14s)]
*  All right. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6914.14s)]
*  Well, let's go to the next story here. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6915.14s)]
*  Dave's holding his powder. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6917.5s)]
*  Circle Internet Group goes public and it explodes, goes exponential. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6920.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6926.9800000000005s)]
*  So two parts of this story. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6927.9800000000005s)]
*  One of them is Jeremy Allaire, who's stuck with this for so many years and he deserves [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6930.98s)]
*  every bit of his success for just grinding it out. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6936.24s)]
*  It's always tough to be an entrepreneur. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6941.099999999999s)]
*  He had to grind it out over a long period of time with regulators all over him and different [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6942.9s)]
*  administrations and people going to jail and what a persistent story. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6948.5s)]
*  But anyway, the reason this is so, so important is because agent to agent transactions can [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6953.219999999999s)]
*  be done in either Bitcoin or dollars now and you can move back and forth seamlessly. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6958.9s)]
*  The old method, the Swift network, the interbank trading network is great if you're trying [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6963.179999999999s)]
*  to move a million dollars to Hong Kong because it's only like a buck. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6967.98s)]
*  Terrible if you're trying to do a penny micro transaction with another AI agent. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6972.58s)]
*  So this solves that problem. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6976.62s)]
*  Because the current pricing model on AI is subscription fees. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6979.259999999999s)]
*  Give me 200 bucks a month or 20 bucks a month flat. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6981.98s)]
*  But that's crazy, right? [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6985.08s)]
*  So the digitalization gets throttled because if you're trying to write code or talk to [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6986.08s)]
*  your AI, it'll slow down every now and then. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6991.76s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6993.96s)]
*  Because there are too many users online. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6994.96s)]
*  Why can't I just pay for what I use as I go? [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6995.96s)]
*  Well, it's because we didn't have Circle. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=6998.6s)]
*  So the whole AI economy needs to now move to these micro payments and this is what's [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7000.44s)]
*  going to enable it. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7004.68s)]
*  And that's why the stock is up so much. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7005.68s)]
*  Yeah, I've been texting with Jeremy, super impressed, congratulating him on this exponential [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7006.68s)]
*  growth. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7011.96s)]
*  The stock market goes out at $31 a share and peaks at $300 a share. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7012.96s)]
*  Extraordinary, right? [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7018.24s)]
*  These are the IPOs that the entrepreneurial market needs to fuel sort of the opening of [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7019.24s)]
*  the doors wide open. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7025.28s)]
*  Saleem, thoughts? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7027.32s)]
*  I want to just echo the kudos here for a slightly different reason, which is one of the big [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7029.96s)]
*  issues in the crypto world has been trust. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7038.4800000000005s)]
*  You have a lot of scam artists and a lot of shucksters and can you actually deliver [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7041.72s)]
*  trust and Jeremy over a long period of time has demonstrated rock solid, stable, trustworthy [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7045.280000000001s)]
*  environment and that's not an easy to do in the environment where everybody else is a [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7052.52s)]
*  shuckster. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7057.2s)]
*  And in the United States. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7058.2s)]
*  That's a huge kudos there. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7059.2s)]
*  Within the US territory of law, if you would, which is super important. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7060.2s)]
*  Circle Internet Group is a financial technology founded in 2013. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7066.96s)]
*  It's a stable coin pegged one to one for the US dollar and it's going to enable, as you [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7073.6s)]
*  said Dave, my AI agents to go and transact, microtransactions and it's finally going to [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7079.56s)]
*  enable what has been the full promise of the Internet. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7089.52s)]
*  Not just data, not just video, not just words, but a financial layer. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7093.6s)]
*  And I can't wait. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7099.56s)]
*  Can I say one thing about stable coins? [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7100.56s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7103.280000000001s)]
*  It's awesome to have this pegged against the dollar, but once you have something, there's [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7104.280000000001s)]
*  so many natural assets in the ground and out in the world. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7109.240000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7113.160000000001s)]
*  You can peg a stable coin against say real estate holdings or something like that. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7114.160000000001s)]
*  And when that becomes possible, as long as the trust again needs to be there, you're [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7117.76s)]
*  going to unlock unbelievable amounts of capital flow. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7121.6s)]
*  One of my friends is actually contracted, I can't say the details here, with a government [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7125.400000000001s)]
*  who has large gold deposits underground and they've gotten a contract where they're going [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7130.52s)]
*  to peg a token against the gold in the ground and not dig it out, wait until the technology [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7136.56s)]
*  for being able to extract it more environmentally friendly is there. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7147.4s)]
*  But that's an extraordinary thought that there's so many assets that could be sort of connected [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7151.32s)]
*  to a token or a stable token. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7157.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7160.24s)]
*  It's the missing ingredient actually and kind of the trifecta of digital transactions because [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7161.88s)]
*  Bitcoin has become a great store of wealth, but there's no guarantee that it's stable. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7166.44s)]
*  The dollar is guaranteed to go down in value, right? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7172.48s)]
*  We just print more dollars every year. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7174.44s)]
*  So you don't want to have a huge balance sitting in circle for a long period of time. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7175.92s)]
*  So what people will tend to do is park their money in Bitcoin, then if they want to transact [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7179.6s)]
*  in dollars, move it over to circle, it's all seamless, do your micro transactions in circle, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7183.08s)]
*  then come back to Bitcoin. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7188.16s)]
*  But what if you want something tied to something incredibly stable like real estate or gold [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7189.16s)]
*  or whatever? [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7193.6s)]
*  Well, it doesn't exist yet. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7194.6s)]
*  So that would be the trifecta of the crypto circle. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7195.6s)]
*  All right, moonshot mates, what an extraordinary couple of weeks since we spoke last. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7199.2s)]
*  There's so many other stories I can't wait to cover with you guys in the next week or [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7205.28s)]
*  two ahead. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7209.32s)]
*  Any travels coming up for you guys? [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7211.92s)]
*  Saleem, are you orbiting the planet again? [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7213.92s)]
*  I just came back from a hundredth birthday party of a grandparent. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7217.16s)]
*  Lily is one of Lily's grandmothers, which was unbelievable. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7222.0s)]
*  Not going anywhere for a bit. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7227.16s)]
*  I think I'll be seeing you soon, Peter, at the end of July in Utah maybe. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7228.8s)]
*  So we'll talk about that separately. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wLRUmAUXFw&t=7234.62s)]
