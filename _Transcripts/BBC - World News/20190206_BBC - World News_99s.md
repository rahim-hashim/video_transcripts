Video Description: US President Donald Trump has vowed to end what he described as China's "theft" of American jobs.
Giving his second State of the Union address, Mr Trump told the US Congress a trade deal with China would require "structural changes to end unfair trade practices".
The speech comes ahead of last-minute talks between the two countries aimed at reaching a deal on trade.
New tariffs could kick in on 1 March when a 90-day trade war truce ends.
