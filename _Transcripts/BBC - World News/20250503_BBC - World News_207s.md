Video Description: One of the largest Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied West Bank has become uninhabitable, said the mayor of Jenin.
Before the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Israel was already engaged in a military campaign against armed groups in the West Bank.
 
Israel's defence minister has called the camps "nests of terror" and in January stepped up its campaign against the armed groups operating inside them â€“ entering and blockading a number of refugee camps in the northern West Bank that are home to tens of thousands of Palestinians.
It ordered residents to leave and began a wave of building demolitions, while giving some residents brief opportunities to gather belongings.
 
The BBC has followed the story of one man who was forced out of the Jenin refugee camp and whose home was identified for demolition by the IDF.
BBC correspondent Emir Nader has more.

*  Now, one of the largest Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied West Bank has become uninhabitable, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=0.0s)]
*  says the mayor of Jenin. Thousands of Palestinians have been displaced and hundreds of homes have been demolished [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=6.0s)]
*  since Israel launched a military campaign in January, that's according to the UN, which says that the situation is unprecedented. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=11.0s)]
*  Israel says it wants to dismantle what it calls terror strongholds in the camps. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=18.0s)]
*  The BBC has followed the story of one man who was forced out of the camp and whose home was identified for demolition by the IDF. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=23.0s)]
*  Emir Nader has more. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=30.0s)]
*  It's been three months since Jamal was forced out of his home. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=35.0s)]
*  He's one of thousands of Palestinians from Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank who don't know when or if the Israeli military will let them return. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=38.0s)]
*  There, there is my house. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=47.0s)]
*  The house is less than a kilometer away, but Jamal has only been allowed one brief visit. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=49.0s)]
*  My house was standing when I last saw it. I went to bring my UN aid card. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=55.0s)]
*  Now he has no idea how much of his home remains. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=60.0s)]
*  I can see so much destruction and damage in the camp, a lot of destruction and demolition. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=64.0s)]
*  In the West Bank, refugee camps home to Palestinians displaced from Israel have become the base of militias who say they're fighting Israeli occupation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=71.0s)]
*  Israel calls them terrorists and in January stepped up its campaign against them, entering the camps and forcing out residents before beginning a wave of building demolitions. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=81.0s)]
*  While filming, we see Palestinian municipal workers attempting to clear a route to a hospital. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=92.0s)]
*  They're detained, then denied entry to the blockaded camp. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=97.0s)]
*  There are big challenges in terms of providing services to citizens. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=104.0s)]
*  As everyone knows, the infrastructure in Jenin camp has been totally demolished. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=107.0s)]
*  Israel's goal is to try to make Jenin camp totally unfit to live in. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=111.0s)]
*  And I am telling you, it has now become completely unlivable. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=115.0s)]
*  Israel says the demolitions are necessary for its counter-terrorism operations, improving military movement through the camps, but doesn't confirm which buildings it's destroyed. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=122.0s)]
*  In March, Israel issued a map of over 90 buildings it said it would demolish in Jenin camp. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=133.0s)]
*  Jomaz appeared to be among them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=138.0s)]
*  Using satellite imagery, we've identified that at least 33 of those buildings have been destroyed, including Jomaz. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=140.0s)]
*  The UN says it estimates that Israel has demolished 200 buildings, housing 600 apartments in Jenin camp alone. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=147.0s)]
*  Now living in temporary accommodation, Jomaz is indignant about losing his home. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=154.0s)]
*  Why did they demolish my house? I want to know. I want the Israeli army to give me justification. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=166.0s)]
*  I had no links to militants. I am a peaceful person. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=172.0s)]
*  Jomaz, like thousands of other Palestinians in the West Bank, now doesn't know where he will live next, without compensation and with few of his life's belongings, besides the family pet. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=177.0s)]
*  I am only looking to live in peace and freedom. That's it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=191.0s)]
*  I swear, I am so sick of it all. We have had enough. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Na5nmo4GY&t=196.0s)]
