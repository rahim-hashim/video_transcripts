# US to hold direct nuclear talks with Iran | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik)
*  Welcome back to BBC News. Now Russia has welcome news that the US and Iran are to meet for indirect talks on Tehran's nuclear program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=0.0s)]
*  The Kremlin says it's long supported a diplomatic settlement to the dispute. Iranian state media says indirect talks with the US will be held in Oman on Saturday, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=7.0s)]
*  led by Iran's foreign minister and President Trump's special envoy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=17.0s)]
*  While announcing the meeting during Benjamin Netanyahu's White House visit yesterday, Donald Trump said Iran is going to be in great danger if talks don't go well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=21.0s)]
*  We're dealing with them directly and maybe a deal is going to be made. That would be great. It would be really great for Iran, I can tell you that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=51.0s)]
*  Well, I've been speaking to Dr Roxane Farman-Farmihan, a lecturer in international relations at Cambridge University. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=60.0s)]
*  This was her assessment on the likelihood of those talks being successful. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=67.0s)]
*  I think they're in better position than they have been in the past under Biden, for example, when the talks did not go anywhere. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=72.0s)]
*  I think Trump is very motivated to try to open up the economy of Iran, which has been very much in a backwater for so many years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=81.0s)]
*  That would certainly gain him the accolades of changing a relationship that has been hostile and very cold with the United States after 45 years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=92.0s)]
*  So if he is able to establish a deal that really lifts sanctions, and I think the Iranians are quite keen for that because their currency is plummeting and their economy is in very bad shape. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=104.0s)]
*  Inflation is rampant. So I think they are more open as well than they have been for some years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=120.0s)]
*  A quick answer to this question. How close is Tehran to any sort of nuclear device? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=127.0s)]
*  Well, it's producing more advanced enrichment of nuclear material than it has been before, which is worrying. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=132.0s)]
*  On the other hand, it has consistently claimed it is not making a nuclear weapon, and most experts agree it's not, and that its main reason for the nuclear program is to use leverage to lift its sanctions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WY753zYoik&t=141.0s)]
