# Anti-Brexit receipts cause stir for restaurant - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 28, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8)
*  I've established this restaurant, Westminster Kitchen, about three years ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=0.0s)]
*  On the day of the debate around Prime Minister's deal for leaving the European Union, I got [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=12.64s)]
*  really frustrated. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=18.88s)]
*  I was reading the news constantly, checking up, seeing what's going to happen, trying [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=19.88s)]
*  to find a way to express my own feelings towards the Brexit, towards the contribution of immigrants [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=24.28s)]
*  I'm making to Britain and so on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=29.88s)]
*  So on the day I thought that the best way I could do something about this would be to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=31.72s)]
*  print a message on our receipts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  The message was very simple and it said, Brexit is bad, immigrants make Britain great, they've [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=39.68s)]
*  also cooked and served your food today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=46.36s)]
*  Initial reaction was horrible, I would say, the variety of threats we've received. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  I will give you a few examples. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=54.8s)]
*  One guy says we must burn the place down, that's one of the threats you get. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=57.36s)]
*  Another, they will name me as a person Ibrahim Dogus from Lombard and then they will say [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=62.76s)]
*  we will be seeing him very shortly, very soon, we'll go and see him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=68.64s)]
*  We have some negative reaction here, they've been calling us and calling us, can you tell [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=72.36s)]
*  the management or answer the phone, can you send your chef back home and you know the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=86.24s)]
*  nasty things they've been saying about us, which is we just, normal people, we've been [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=91.56s)]
*  here a long time ago and I've always been working and paying my taxes and just being [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  as normal as I can and we're getting these things, I feel a little bit sad myself. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  Does it make you ever want to leave? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  For me, it makes me want to leave but I'm just worried about my son, that's the only [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  reason, otherwise if they want me to leave I can leave, no problem. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  But the only thing I'm worried about my son, as he's in school now and he really really [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  feels like he's English, whenever you ask him where you're from he says I'm English, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=127.64s)]
*  so I'm really worried about his future, I don't know what the future will hold for him. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=131.4s)]
*  In the last few days we've been receiving lots of positive sporting messages from public, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=147.96s)]
*  members of public all across the United Kingdom, people from very different communities, different [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=153.4s)]
*  backgrounds, different professions, they've all been out and writing to us emails, leaving [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=157.68s)]
*  messages on social media and cooling us to say how proud they are for what we have done [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  and that encourages us a lot and we will continue to publish and print our messages on our receipts. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwsxUsWP4A8&t=169.48s)]
