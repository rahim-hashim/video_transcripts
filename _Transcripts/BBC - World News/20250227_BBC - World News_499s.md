*  as this investigation continues but Gene Hackman really Casher had the most incredible career he [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=147.68s)]
*  acted for 60 years appeared in 100 films won two Oscars as you said for the French Connection and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=154.48s)]

*  played a real variety of roles from the real heavyweight serious roles to ones where he had [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  fun with him and almost poked fun at himself so the Royal Tenenbaums which he won a Golden Globe [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  for back in 2001 and also famously played Lex Luthor in the Superman films in the 1970s and 80s [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  and had a lot of fun playing this very over-the-top villain the nemesis of Superman a lot of people [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=190.08s)]
*  perhaps would have watched those films when they were growing up and he hadn't actually acted in [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  anything new since 2004 so over 20 years ago he basically made the decision that he wanted to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=203.52s)]
*  retire from acting from that public life he was never an actor though that you would see at all [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=209.84s)]
*  the different premieres and red carpet events he was a very private person and he did say I [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  trained to be an actor I didn't train to be a star I trained to play roles not to deal with fame and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=222.4s)]
*  agents and lawyers and the press and he found it quite difficult to watch himself on screen he said [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=228.08s)]
*  it really cost me a lot emotionally to watch myself I think of myself and I feel like I'm quite young [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=233.68s)]
*  and then I look at this old man with the baggy chins and the tired eyes and the receding hairline [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=239.84s)]
*  and all that so he was quite honest about aging and not particularly wanting to see himself [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=244.64s)]
*  aging on screen but he was obviously a very much loved person as well and we've talked about how a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  lot of people particularly in Hollywood will be waking up to this news might not know this news [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=257.52s)]
*  yet and you imagine that there's going to be tributes coming in thick and fast because he's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=262.32s)]
*  worked with some of the greats I mean he won one of his Oscars in a Clint Eastwood film for example [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=266.64s)]
*  so we're imagining a lot of tributes coming in but yeah if you're just joining us we've heard [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=273.04s)]
*  this very very sad news this morning that Gene Hackman who was 95 years old has been found dead [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  at his home with his wife Betsy and their dog in Santa Fe New Mexico and we're just getting a few [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  details coming in because this is very recent it's breaking news and police are saying there are no [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  suspicious circumstances but they haven't given a cause of death as yet I mean this couple have [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=297.84s)]
*  been married for a very long time they've been married since 1991 Betsy was significantly younger [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=304.0s)]
*  than Gene Hackman she was 63 but they've been married a very long time and they both moved to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  Santa Fe New Mexico together 20 years ago and rarely seen out in public we think the last time [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=316.55999999999995s)]
*  they were seen out in public or at least the press saw them out in public was last year when [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=322.64s)]
*  they were popping out for a coffee because they were never a couple that courted the spotlight or [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=326.56s)]
*  particularly wanted the spotlight and as I just said Gene Hackman said I trained to be an actor [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=331.6s)]
*  I didn't train to be a star so really kind of the significant difference between those two things he [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=335.92s)]
*  didn't want to be doing celebrity photo shoots for example and he was really just so modest you read [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=341.68s)]
*  that quote there how it cost him a lot emotionally to watch himself on screen but he was once an [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=347.04s)]
*  incredible thing if you think about it he was once described as having the face of a truck driver [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=354.96s)]
*  but obviously we know him as one of Hollywood's most bankable stars and an incredible breadth of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=360.4s)]
*  range when it comes to the roles that he took upon himself but arguably never took himself so [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=368.4s)]
*  seriously I just for viewers just joining us and I'm going to just repeat this news that we've [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=373.92s)]

*  don't know the cause of death at the moment this is an active investigation at the moment but [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=401.04s)]
*  it will come as a shock he was 95 his wife as Charlotte was saying somewhat younger than him [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUkN3imr93k&t=408.16s)]
