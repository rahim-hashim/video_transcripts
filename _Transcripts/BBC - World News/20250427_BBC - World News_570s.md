Video Description: Pope Francis has been buried in Rome after a funeral ceremony and procession attended by hundreds of thousands of people and many heads of state.
The first South American pontiff passed away on Monday aged 88, marking the end of a 12-year pontificate.
Authorities said 140,000 had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse – a repurposed white popemobile – crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognisable sights.
Pope Francis was laid to rest at the Santa Maria Maggiore and buried in the righthand side of the church, near a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary.

*  traveled from the Vatican following his funeral on Saturday. Huge crowds had gathered in St Peter's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=17.44s)]
*  Square for the main service which was attended by dozens of heads of state and royal guests. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=23.2s)]
*  The Vatican has released new pictures of Pope Francis's tomb where he was buried yesterday, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=28.56s)]
*  our religion editor Alim Macbaw reports. St Peter's, named after the apostle considered [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=34.4s)]
*  by Catholics to be the first pope, the Basilica's curved colonnades representing the open arms of an [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=43.44s)]
*  embrace. This was the spectacular backdrop for the farewell to the 266th pope. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=50.4s)]
*  Inside the Basilica, ahead of the funeral mass, a last chance for visiting dignitaries, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=64.0s)]
*  including the Prince of Wales, to pay their respects. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=69.84s)]
*  Sir Keir Starmer, one of dozens of world leaders in attendance. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  There was applause in the crowd when President Zelensky appeared. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=80.64s)]
*  But by mid-morning the invited guests took their seats. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  Clergy on the right looking out, politicians and sovereigns on the left, but other guests [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=91.6s)]
*  invited at Pope Francis's request included prison inmates, migrants and torture victims. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=97.2s)]
*  On the streets around St Peter's Square, a quarter of a million others waited. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=106.64s)]
*  And then to start proceedings, the body of Pope Francis was brought through the Basilica. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=113.04s)]
*  In the coffin with him, his mitre or papal hat, his pastoral staff or crozier and a scroll, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=118.96s)]
*  a written record of his life and pontificate. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  There was gentle, spontaneous applause through the huge crowds as the coffin emerged into the light. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=137.92s)]
*  It's 14 pallbearers taking it to the front of this breathtaking arena. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=149.36s)]
*  Presenting it to the world, but not on a platform, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=155.84s)]
*  Pope Francis had asked that his coffin be placed on the ground. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=159.44s)]
*  Although elements of the funeral have been simplified following instructions left by [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=178.96s)]
*  Pope Francis himself, the magnitude of the moment is still reflected in the ritual and tradition [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=192.56s)]
*  and spectacle on this stunning stage. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=199.84s)]
*  It was 91 year old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Ray who presided over the mass and delivered the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=203.44s)]
*  homily reflecting on the things Pope Francis cared about his opposition to war, his passion [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=210.64s)]
*  for the environment and for the dignity of migrants. He mentioned some notable papal trips. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=216.72s)]
*  It is significant that Pope Francis first journey was to Lampedusa, he says, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  an island that symbolizes the tragedy of migration with thousands of people drowning at sea, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=237.84s)]
*  as well as the celebration of a mass on the border between Mexico and the United States. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=243.92s)]
*  At talk of these causes, the crowd applauded, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=252.72s)]
*  though there may have been discomfort for some politicians. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  At the end of the mass, there was a final blessing for Pope Francis. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=262.88s)]
*  But he wasn't going to be buried at St. Peter's like other popes, but would instead be taken [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  in a converted popemobile to his favorite spot at a different basilica in the center of Rome. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=276.56s)]
*  More than 150,000 people lined the streets to say goodbye, a nod to the connection he had to the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=282.64s)]
*  masses. At the Pope's destination, a group of people from homeless centers waited to welcome him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=290.4s)]
*  So too did the clergy who'd participate in the final part of today's ceremonies. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=298.4s)]
*  Away from the gaze of the public, the late pope was laid to rest, in a tomb inscribed with just [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=306.64s)]
*  one word, the Latin version of his chosen name, the Latin word for the dead. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  That's reports by religion editor Aleem Maghpour. Well, Andrea Tonielli is the media editor for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  the Holy See. He told me what it was like to be at the Pope's funeral. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  I think that the funeral was a simple and beautiful ceremony. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=331.6s)]
*  It was a very special one. It was a very special one. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=336.0s)]
*  It was a very special one. It was a very special one. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=339.12s)]
*  It was a very special one. It was a very special one. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=341.92s)]
*  I think that the funeral was a simple and beautiful ceremony. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  The people of God, the simple faithful took center stage. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=350.08s)]
*  Forty hundred thousand people participated in the square and the street of Rome. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=354.56s)]
*  Only one week ago, we have to remember, the pope met for the last time the people in St. Peter's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=359.68s)]
*  Square. And yesterday, people have returned this embrace. Yesterday, it was touched by the presence [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=365.84s)]
*  of representatives of other religions' faith. And then I was struck by the meeting between [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=373.2s)]
*  President Trump and President Zelensky because Francis' cry for peace was what characterized [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=379.76s)]
*  his pontificate to the very end. The meeting between the two presidents was, I think, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=386.8s)]
*  the last little miracle of Pope Francis. Indeed, it was a symbolic meeting. How would [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=392.8s)]
*  you describe the mood among officials at the Vatican about what comes next in terms of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=399.68s)]
*  electing a new pope? I think that we have to wait and we have to wait the meeting [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=405.68s)]
*  between cardinals. So it's impossible to speak about this now. But I want to underline the legacy [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=414.32s)]
*  of Pope Francis. I believe the most important legacy he leaves is the magisterium of mercy. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=422.88s)]
*  In these years, during all his pontificate, he has shown the face of a church with open doors, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=429.6s)]
*  which welcomes everyone. He spoke about a church that is a filed hospital and not a customs house. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  He has shown tenderness and closeness toward all, but especially toward the humble, the last, the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  poor, the sinners. People have understood this attitude and this teaching of the pope of mercy [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  very well. During the last World Youth Day, he repeated that the church is a welcoming home for [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=458.4s)]
*  everyone. I think that this legacy is important also for the church now. Yes, everyone is talking [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  about his legacy in terms of spreading the message of mercy and he was incredibly popular as well. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=473.67999999999995s)]
*  Do you think that that's the natural direction for the church going forward now? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=481.28s)]
*  It's impossible to say now because the cardinal, they have to discuss. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=485.12s)]
*  And in this period, they have to discuss the future of the church. But this process, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  it will start next Monday with the congregation of cardinals. So they have to arrive, all [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=499.12s)]
*  the electors in Rome, and they have to discuss. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=508.16s)]
*  Andrea Tuanieli there. Well, let's show you some pictures that have just come in from the Vatican. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=511.6s)]
*  These are images showing the tomb of Pope Francis. So this is in the basilica of the Santa Maria [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=518.88s)]
*  Maggiore church and this is where he was laid to rest on Saturday evening, of course, after that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=528.4s)]
*  solemn, powerful funeral service that saw hundreds of thousands of people in attendance. Crucially [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=536.56s)]
*  today, members of the public will be able to visit the basilica there and to pay their respects at [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  the tomb of Pope Francis. Of course, engraved on the tomb is simply the name Francis in Latin. Of [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=551.76s)]
*  course, that was his papal name. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=560.64s)]
