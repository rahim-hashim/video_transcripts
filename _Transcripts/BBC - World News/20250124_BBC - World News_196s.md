Video Description: Four young female Israeli soldiers are the next set to be released by Hamas as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal.
 
Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag will be freed in exchange for 180 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
 
All were serving as observers at the Nahal Oz army base on the border with Gaza when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, 2023.
 
Their release will be the second such exchange since the ceasefire came into effect last Sunday. Three hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners were released in the first swap.
 
In total, 33 hostages are set to be freed over six weeks of the first phase of the ceasefire, which came into effect on 20 January, 2025.

**BBC - World News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g)
*  Let's return to that breaking news from the Middle East because in the last hour Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=0.0s)]
*  have named the four female hostages due to be released tomorrow as part of the Israel-Gaza [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=5.28s)]
*  ceasefire deal. They are Naama Levy, Liri Elbag, Daniela Gilboa and Karina Ariev. They [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=10.84s)]
*  are all soldiers who were seized from their army base in southern Israel during the October [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=19.2s)]
*  7 attacks. In return for their release Israel is expected to release about 180 female Palestinian [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=24.84s)]
*  detainees. Well our correspondent Nick Beek is in Jerusalem and he gave me the latest [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=31.72s)]
*  details. Hamas have made this announcement giving the names of the four hostages who [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=36.12s)]
*  will be released tomorrow. As we expected they are four women and they are it seems [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  all members of the IDF, the Israeli Defence Forces. I can give you the names of them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=48.72s)]
*  The first soldier to be released tomorrow, this is according to Hamas, is Karina Ariev. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=53.48s)]
*  The second is Daniel Gilboa. The third Naama Levy and the fourth hostage according to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=59.48s)]
*  Hamas to be released tomorrow is Liri Elbag. Now obviously for their families a huge, huge [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  moment of relief but what happens now in the next 24 hours of course is crucial. We've [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=75.6s)]
*  got the precedent because of course we saw what happened last weekend with that first [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=80.96s)]
*  round of hostages being released but these are the four names. What will happen is that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=85.44s)]
*  Hamas will hand over the four women to the Red Cross and the Red Cross will then deliver [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=90.8s)]
*  them to IDF forces that remain in the Gaza Strip so that's what will happen. We anticipate [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=96.72s)]
*  it will take place tomorrow but of course just like we saw last weekend there may well [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=103.32s)]
*  be some delays in this process but this is what we're hearing from Hamas. These are the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=108.6s)]
*  four names that Hamas has just released, Matthew. And we wait to get any Israeli reaction. I'm [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=114.8s)]
*  sure that will come in the next half hour or so but in exchange take me through that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  part of what we're likely to see over the weekend. Yes, so the first part of this would [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=126.84s)]
*  be the four women being released and being brought back to Israel to their families. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=133.64s)]
*  A few hours later the choreography will be that the next tranche of prisoners in Israeli [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=139.2s)]
*  jails, 180 is the figure that has been talked about. We will have to see if that is actually [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  accurate but certainly that's what's going to happen. So first of all the Israeli hostages [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=153.6s)]
*  will be released then the Palestinian prisoners will be released. All the while the hope is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=158.28s)]
*  that this process continues during this initial six weeks, seven weeks of the deal and that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=163.8s)]
*  the fighting doesn't resume. So this is what we expect to take place over this weekend. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=170.36s)]
*  Nick Beek there in Jerusalem. Let me just give you the very latest on this story because [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=175.76s)]
*  it's coming from Benjamin Netanyahu's office. Israel confirming they have received that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=181.28s)]
*  list of hostages to be released tomorrow. So we had that initially from Hamas, that's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=186.84s)]
*  now been confirmed from the Israeli Prime Minister's office. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrNseXB94g&t=191.68s)]
