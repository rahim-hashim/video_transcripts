# What will Joe Biden be remembered for? #USPresident #USPolitics #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU)
*  With Joe Biden, it's really easy to remember all the slips and the stumbles [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=0.0s)]
*  and the glaring gaffes that convinced Americans he was just too old [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=4.48s)]
*  for a second term in the White House. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  But he has got some achievements that he can be proud of. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=9.28s)]
*  He passed groundbreaking laws. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=11.6s)]
*  He created millions of jobs. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  He strengthened NATO and he supported Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=14.64s)]
*  But of course, we cannot forget the chaotic withdrawal of US forces [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  from Afghanistan, the rising inflation and the record numbers of illegal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=20.92s)]
*  immigrants crossing the southern border into America. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=24.88s)]
*  There are plenty of Democrats who blame Joe Biden [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=27.32s)]
*  for their election defeat in November. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=29.52s)]
*  They think he should have stepped aside sooner to make way for a new [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  candidate to take the lead. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=34.36s)]
*  And there was a time when Mr Biden promised that he would be the bridge [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=35.44s)]
*  to the next generation of Democrat leaders. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=38.72s)]
*  In the end, he might be remembered as the bridge between Donald Trump's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=40.96s)]
*  first and second terms in the White House. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilZQ8EINuU&t=44.28s)]
