Video Description: At least 10 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 40 injured by Israeli forces during a major operation in the Jenin area in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says.
 
There were several air strikes on Tuesday as a large number of troops entered the city and its refugee camp, backed by drones, helicopters and armoured bulldozers, according to Palestinian media.
 
Israel's prime minister said it launched an "extensive and significant" operation to "defeat terrorism" in Jenin, long seen as a stronghold of Palestinian armed groups.
 
It comes three days after the start of a ceasefire in Gaza and highlights the threat of more violence in the West Bank.
