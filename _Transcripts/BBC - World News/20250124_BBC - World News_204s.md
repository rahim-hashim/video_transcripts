Video Description: The reported disappearance of more than 80 government critics over the last six months has caused a huge public backlash in Kenya.
 
A judge has warned he will imprison top security officials for contempt of court on Monday if they fail to appear for a third time to account for a recent string of alleged abductions.
 
The case is linked to the disappearances documented by Kenya's National Commission on Human Rights since nationwide protests against proposed tax hikes began last June.
 
At least 24 are said to still be missing.

# Kenya abductions spark huge public backlash | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s)
*  A judge in Kenya has warned he will imprison the police chief for contempt of court on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=0.0s)]
*  Monday if he fails to show up for a third time and account for a recent string of alleged [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=5.22s)]
*  abductions. Police have denied involvement, but the disappearance of dozens of young government [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=11.1s)]
*  critics since anti-tax protests last year has provoked a public backlash. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=16.5s)]
*  Arafka correspondent Barbara Pless-Asher reports. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  In the season of Kenya's Gen Z protests, the town of Kitangelo was a flashpoint. Police [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=27.76s)]
*  struck hard at demonstrators angered by tax hikes and corruption. Dozens were arrested, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=34.24s)]
*  but many around the country disappeared. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=40.86s)]
*  Jamil's brother Aslam was one of the protest organizers. He'd been warned to stop. Both [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=43.36s)]
*  were pulled into a car outside their home, hooded and handcuffed. After that, no sign [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=52.84s)]
*  of them for 32 days. Aslam tells me he was regularly beaten, his tormentor demanding [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=58.0s)]
*  to know who was funding the protests. He shows me his scars. They were held in small, dark [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=65.0s)]
*  cells, they said, in an unknown location. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=71.12s)]
*  I was very scared. When the door was opened, that man would come in with a fiber cable [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=76.36s)]
*  and a metal rod. I was scared he'd come to beat me again or finish me off. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=80.84s)]
*  Who abducted you? Do you know who abducted you? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=86.04s)]
*  We were heavily armed. They did the abduction in plain daylight. So you see, the security [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=88.04s)]
*  agents had, they knew what was going on. They had the tracking devices that could track [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  down our mobile phones. I don't know if anybody is capable of doing that in this country, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=100.2s)]
*  apart from the security agencies. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=106.56s)]
*  Others like them were captured on camera. More than 80 government critics reported missing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=109.36s)]
*  so far, about a third still unaccounted for. People are demanding answers. The reply from [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=114.36s)]
*  the government spokesman? The state is not responsible. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=122.96s)]
*  There's no way you can say that is only government security operations. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=125.72s)]
*  So you might have parallel security structures that are interfering here? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=130.4s)]
*  Security may also be part of organized crime. Those who would want to abduct anyone would [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=134.72s)]
*  do it for a certain reason. It could also be for political reasons, by the way. Our [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=140.88s)]
*  political detractors have really railed on this issue. They actually ran with it just [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=146.36s)]
*  to set a political score. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=154.8s)]
*  But this isn't new. Kenya has a history of state-sponsored abductions, especially under [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=159.4s)]
*  the authoritarian leader Daniel Arap Moi in the 1980s and 90s. There is more accountability [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=164.2s)]
*  now. The police chief's been summoned to court three times, but he hasn't shown up yet. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=173.56s)]
*  President Ruto has promised to stop the abductions, forced to respond to public outrage and to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=185.44s)]
*  concern from Western allies. Kenyans are waiting to see whether the country has really moved [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=190.8s)]
*  on from its dark past. Barbara Platt-Asher, BBC News, Nairobi. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDP6lt9S7s&t=197.76000000000002s)]
