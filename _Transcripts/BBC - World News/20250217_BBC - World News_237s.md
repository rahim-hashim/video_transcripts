# Israeli government to discuss second phase of Gaza ceasefire | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA)
*  The Israeli Prime Minister is due to hold a meeting of his Security Cabinet today to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=0.0s)]
*  discuss the second phase of the ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  On Sunday, Ms Netanyahu hosted the new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio for talks, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=9.58s)]
*  with both men praising what they called the bold vision of President Trump's plan to remove [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=14.92s)]
*  Palestinians from Gaza and rebuild the devastated enclave as a result. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=19.56s)]
*  That plan has been flatly rejected by Palestinians and Arab nations and would also violate international [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=24.96s)]
*  law. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Let's cross live now to Jerusalem and speak to our Middle East editor Sebastian Asher. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=32.56s)]
*  And Sebastian, just tell us what came out of these talks between Marco Rubio and the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=37.56s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  I think the key element from it was essentially that Marco Rubio, as the new US Secretary [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=44.8s)]
*  of State, was very much standing beside Ms Netanyahu, fully united in their aim, united [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=50.48s)]
*  aim, as he stated it, to eliminate Hamas. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  That's what Ms Netanyahu has been saying throughout the offensive, throughout the war in Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=63.0s)]
*  That's his ultimate aim. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  The issue with that is that in order to move on to a second phase of the ceasefire deal, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=69.56s)]
*  at some point the conditions are that Israel should have a full withdrawal of its troops [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=76.74s)]
*  from Gaza as part of that phase. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=83.14s)]
*  And within that, all the remaining hostages in Gaza would also be released. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=85.41999999999999s)]
*  I think this meeting leaves another question mark over whether that will happen, as is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  envisaged in the conditions that were originally set out. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=95.06s)]
*  And Ms Netanyahu is due to have a meeting with his security cabinet later today here [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=100.14s)]
*  in Israel, at which he will discuss phase two. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=105.9s)]
*  And we've heard from reports in the Israeli media that after that meeting, depending on [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=110.34s)]
*  what the cabinet says, he may then give instructions to an Israeli negotiating team, which is heading [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=116.86000000000001s)]
*  to Cairo, to talk about phase one, which still has almost two weeks to go, but will maybe [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=123.42s)]
*  give them instructions to start looking at phase two. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=128.86s)]
*  Now, those talks on phase two were meant to have started around two weeks ago now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=131.86s)]
*  As far as we know, no substantial negotiations have taken place. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=137.3s)]
*  So things are up in the air about that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=141.46s)]
*  And just to say, there are families, relatives of the hostages in Gaza who are holding demonstrations [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=143.18s)]
*  across Israel today to mark the 500th day of their relatives in captivity in Gaza. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=150.9s)]
*  I just passed on my way into the bureau here a group of those relatives who have begun [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=158.1s)]
*  a march to the Israeli parliament, to the Knesset. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=164.06s)]
*  And as I say, they are underlining the feeling in Israel that the absolute priority here, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=172.18s)]
*  beyond anything else, is to ensure that every last Israeli held in Gaza must be released [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=177.66s)]
*  and nothing must get in the way of that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=183.44s)]
*  That is at odds to some extent still with what we're hearing from the Israeli government, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  but there may still be a resumption of the war in Gaza. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  That might then lead to the failure of the second phase being pursued right to its end. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  Sebastian, thank you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=200.17999999999998s)]
*  That's our Middle East editor, Sebastian Ashen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  What you can see at the moment on our screens there are fresh protests that are happening [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  in Tel Aviv, as we're hearing there from Sebastian, families, friends, supporters of those who [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  are still held in Gaza by Hamas and other militant groups continue to protest, pushing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=215.56s)]
*  for the Israeli government to release all of those who are still being held in Gaza. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  But of course, as we're hearing, the Israeli cabinet will be meeting today to discuss the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  second phase that would see more hostage releases. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHeKCjXzgdA&t=233.84s)]
