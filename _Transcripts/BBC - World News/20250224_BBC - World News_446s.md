Video Description: European leaders and other allies have met in Kyiv to reaffirm their solidarity and to announce further support and sanctions on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
 
Many of those attending the summit have been pushing back against US President Donald Trump's unilateral decision to pursue direct peace talks with Moscow.
 
They insist Ukraine and Europe must be involved in negotiations, to ensure any settlement is durable and fair.
 
European leaders have called for the continent to step up their defence, to protect wider values of democracy and freedom from Russian aggression.

*  It's almost like [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=273.6s)]
*  Picking President Zelensky up that is the tone we are seeing now, of course [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=275.68s)]
*  We we have had continued pledges from the UK and the EU which which which can't be ignored [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=279.68s)]
*  billions of pounds worth of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=286.64s)]
*  Of military support, but it's who is not here which speaks volumes America is not here [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=288.96s)]
*  America has made it plain how it sees this war ending. It's also thrown in a couple of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=294.76s)]
*  Insults along the way in terms of labeling President Zelensky as a dictator and blaming him for the war [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=301.84s)]
*  It's completely upended America's foreign policy and given [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  This time of year this anniversary this wartime fixture a very different feel [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=311.84s)]
*  And here we have [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=317.68s)]
*  European allies including Canada [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=319.88s)]
*  Working out how they are going to provide security to the continent how they might [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=322.48s)]
*  Police or enforce a ceasefire agreement once it's eventually [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=328.76s)]
*  signed here in Ukraine and the tone here is not of a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=332.8s)]
*  Consilatory one there's no glossing over. I mean clearly the the America the relationship with America is not a working one currently [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  Now President Zelensky has hosted countless world leaders [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=345.04s)]
*  He is an operator in that regard but at the moment Ukraine is looking inward and it's looking to its neighbors [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=347.8s)]
*  Closer to home who are far from united on how best to go from here [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=353.64s)]
*  Now thanks to James in Kiev. Let's get a perspective to from Moscow our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg has been telling us about the current Russian [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  negotiating position [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=367.96s)]
*  Well what the Russians say is that in order to finish this once and for all they want America to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  Analyze and to understand the root causes of the conflict now when Russia talks about the root causes [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  It means this is not Russia's fault [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=383.76s)]
*  This is the fault of Ukraine and the fault of the West the fault of NATO expansion Russia does not accept any [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  Responsibility for the war which began three years ago with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=392.88s)]
*  So it seems as if the Russians are not in a hurry [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=398.36s)]
*  They believe they have the initiative on the battlefield [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=403.12s)]
*  The Russians have been making progress gaining territory not fast [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=406.64s)]
*  But still gaining territory and they hear what is coming out of the White House [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  They hear the kind of comments that Donald Trump has been coming out with [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=414.86s)]
*  Trump administration officials have been coming out with which have been very critical of President Zelensky and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=419.0s)]
*  not critical at all of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=425.44s)]
*  Vladimir Putin or the Kremlin and they put those two things together and that gives I think the Russians a lot of confidence that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=428.24s)]
*  Especially with the US Russia talks having got underway last week in Saudi Arabia that gives them confidence that they will get a deal [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=435.24s)]
*  To end the war which benefits Russia [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-S0IGnQgbg&t=443.12s)]
