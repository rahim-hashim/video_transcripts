Video Description: US President Donald Trump has announced new tariffs on all goods imported from America's three largest trading partners, China, Mexico and Canada.

Trump said the US would impose tariffs beginning on Tuesday of 25% on Canada and Mexico as well as an additional 10% tax on China. Canadian energy faces a lower 10% tariff.

He had threatened to impose the import taxes if the three countries did not address his concerns about illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

Both Canada and Mexico said they were preparing retaliatory tariffs of their own.

# Canada and Mexico hit back as President Trump imposes huge tariffs | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M)
*  I'm Helena Humphrey. Good to have you with us. We begin with breaking news out of the White House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=0.0s)]
*  where US President Donald Trump has signed tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=4.48s)]
*  America's top trading partners. Now a 25% tariff is imposed on Canadian goods with a 10% levy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=10.8s)]
*  placed on Canadian oil exports. Mexico has been slapped with a similar 25% tax and President [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump has also placed a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods coming into the United States. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=24.96s)]
*  The White House says that the tariffs are meant to quote, hold China, Mexico and Canada accountable [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=30.72s)]
*  for the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States. The tariffs [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=36.0s)]
*  are set to come into effect on Tuesday. That's according to the administration. Well, Canadian [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=40.96s)]
*  officials are decrying the Trump administration's move in statements online. Ontario's premier, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=46.16s)]
*  Doug Ford, said that the tariffs will quote, hurt America, writing that Canada now has no choice [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=52.48s)]
*  but to hit back and hit back hard. Meanwhile, China's Ministry of Commerce repeated its earlier [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=58.48s)]
*  message of caution that there would be no winner in a trade war. And Mexican President Claudia [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=63.28s)]
*  Scheinbaum has yet to issue an updated statement, but she has previously said that she would approach [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  tariffs with a quote, cool head. Well, joining me live now to talk about all of this is Arturo [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=74.32s)]
*  Sadeghan, who formerly served as ambassador of Mexico to the United States from 2007 to 2013. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=80.24s)]
*  Welcome to you, ambassador. Thank you for being with us. Mexico, of course, one of the United [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=87.44s)]
*  States closest trading partners. So what impact do you think 25% tariffs would have on that relationship? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=91.92s)]
*  Well, Helen, it's the it's actually the first trading partner now of the United States for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  almost two years in a row. This is this is in soccer terms, it's a known goal. But if you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=104.32s)]
*  want it in American parlance, it's a self-inflicted wound because these countries, Canada, Mexico, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  the United States, the supply chains that have become so integrated, vertebrated, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  will have a profound impact on inflation, on the well-being of your households. There's an [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=121.28s)]
*  estimate that these tariffs, if they remain in place for over a month or so, will start [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=126.88s)]
*  costing each U.S. household eight hundred and thirty dollars in extra taxes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=133.92s)]
*  So do you think there is a way back from this? We know that the Mexican president, Claudia [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=140.48s)]
*  Scheinbaum, has said that she's essentially got a plan up her sleeve, but she will act [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=147.2s)]
*  with a cool head. So what do you think could come next from Mexico? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=152.64s)]
*  Well, I think it's hard for either Canada or Mexico not to respond in kind with some form [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=158.32s)]
*  of countervailing duties. I think that a generalized countervailing duty or tariff from Mexico [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=163.68s)]
*  would not be a good idea again, because what you want to prevent is by disrupting your own [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=170.24s)]
*  supply chains, elevating inflation costs, cost of living for Mexicans. But I think some form [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=175.36s)]
*  of countervailing duties will be levied on the U.S. The big question mark here, obviously, is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=182.32s)]
*  whether this is a negotiating tactic. There are some, included yours truly, that believe that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=188.48s)]
*  some of this is to force an early renegotiation of the USMCA, which is up for a review in 2026. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=194.0s)]
*  Canada, Mexico, the United States governments need to sit down in July of 2026 to review [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  how USMCA has been working. And the sense some of us have is that this may be beyond the linkage to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=207.92s)]
*  fentanyl, immigration, the bluster and the threat and be able to prove to his constituents [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=214.96s)]
*  that he has kept his promise. There may be an attempt to force an early renegotiation of USMCA. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=220.24s)]
*  So how effective or not do you think that could be as somebody with your diplomatic hat on when [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=227.04s)]
*  it comes to immigration, but also beyond that, as you've just outlined with that trade pact? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, the problem is that if you look at the numbers in terms of immigration flows on the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=240.48s)]
*  US-Mexico border, they've been the lowest even since when Donald Trump was in the White House [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=244.08s)]
*  in the first time around. Mexico has been accepting the outsourcing of enforcement-driven [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  policies by the US, first with Trump, then with Biden, numbers that are at the lowest since [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=256.64s)]
*  the pandemic. And so there's a bit of a disconnect between the rationale for using [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=263.36s)]
*  tariffs to put pressure on Mexico on this specific issue. The fentanyl and organized crime issue, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=269.92s)]
*  that's a completely different can of worms. I think this is in part Mexico's fault because [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=276.0s)]
*  the previous Mexican government of Andres Manuel Obrador completely gutted and eviscerated [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=282.0s)]
*  collaboration with the United States in the fight against organized crime. And this legacy [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=288.24s)]
*  is in terms of what Mexico has been doing, the fentanyl trafficking that we're seeing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=294.08s)]
*  coming either in precursors or fentanyl pills. This is an important issue, but where I think [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=301.12s)]
*  the present President Trump has made a big mistake is on two fronts. Number one, this linkage, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=305.76s)]
*  creating pressure points by putting pressure using different issues of the bilateral agenda, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  putting pressure on trade to get something to change in immigration or drug policy in a very, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=319.04s)]
*  very complex, deep relationship. This is a bad move because it makes things much more difficult [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=326.24s)]
*  to manage diplomatically. The second part is that Washington, the US, is immersed in what I think [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=332.56s)]
*  is the most important recalibration of its foreign policy since the end of the Cold War, which is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=338.32000000000005s)]
*  its relationship with China. And if that recalibration is going to be successful, particularly when it [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  comes to the economy, to trade flows, it needs Canada and Mexico. And so by slapping on these [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=348.8s)]
*  tariffs, Beijing must be rubbing its hands right now. Ambassador, briefly, if you don't mind, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=357.44s)]
*  is there any way back from the brink, free the side here? Well, there might be. I think that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=361.76s)]
*  there's a bit of a sense that there will be negotiations and conversations in the coming days. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=368.32s)]
*  Maybe at some point, President Trump can claim that he has achieved his objectives, that Mexico [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=372.72s)]
*  is doing X and Y, that Canada is doing X and Y, and that he is suspending or putting those tariffs [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=378.08s)]
*  on hold. That is a possibility indeed. Arturo Saracan, who formerly served as Ambassador of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=384.8s)]
*  Mexico to the United States from 2007 to 2013. Very good to get your perspective. Thanks a lot. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=390.8s)]
*  A pleasure, Helen. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYY32Fna-7M&t=397.12s)]
