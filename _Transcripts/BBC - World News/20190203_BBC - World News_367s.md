# UK v US: Which is more dysfunctional? - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 03, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY)
*  On a scale of 0 to 10, how bad are things? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=0.0s)]
*  I would say it's about 9. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=2.96s)]
*  I'd say a 6, maybe a 7. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=5.28s)]
*  The investigations of Donald Trump, all of that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=7.48s)]
*  could push us up to a 9 or a 10 in the blink of an eye. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  OK, well, I think we're ready then. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=17.76s)]
*  I'm an American political journalist, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=19.64s)]
*  but we pay attention to what's going on [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=21.14s)]
*  on the other side of the pond. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=22.76s)]
*  And I lived for 11 and 1 half years there as well, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=24.04s)]
*  so it still feels a bit like home in the US. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=26.44s)]
*  So there's a tweet yesterday that caught my eye. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=29.08s)]
*  And this is what it said. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=32.08s)]
*  It said, we are a nation sleepwalking towards a cliff edge. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=33.12s)]
*  If we do not pull ourselves from the brink, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=36.64s)]
*  the damage will be permanent. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=38.72s)]
*  I read that, and I did a double take, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=40.48s)]
*  because I wasn't quite sure which country they [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=42.28s)]
*  weren't talking about, who the we in this was. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=44.5s)]
*  So I guess my first question to you is, convince me, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=49.16s)]
*  why are things worse on your side of the Atlantic? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=52.32s)]
*  I'm not sure that I'd want to do it quite that way around, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=56.32s)]
*  Anthony. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=58.96s)]
*  I would say it's about 9. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  And the reason I say this, and to get [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  a bit serious for a second, I do think [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=63.92s)]
*  this is the worst peacetime crisis Britain has [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=66.28s)]
*  faced since the end of the Second World War for three [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=68.88s)]
*  reasons, basically, Anthony. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=71.0s)]
*  I mean, number one, the issue is massive. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=72.32s)]
*  I mean, Britain's relationship with the EU, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=74.56s)]
*  it's not just about, I don't know, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=76.32s)]
*  deciding to leave a golf club. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=77.8s)]
*  Two, the politicians are utterly and completely and hopelessly [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=79.44s)]
*  divided still about what to do about the results [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=83.6s)]
*  of that referendum in 2016. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=87.0s)]
*  And then last of all, of course, and I [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  think this is where things are really nasty here [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=91.32s)]
*  and maybe have similarities in the United States, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=94.44s)]
*  the people are divided. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=97.36s)]
*  And people are divided in a way that they [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=98.56s)]
*  haven't been in this country. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  I mean, normally people are divided on political lines, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=102.16s)]
*  class line, wealth lines. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=105.16s)]
*  Now it's more like the US, it's a sort of cultural identity. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  I'd give a Savannah 9 out of 10. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Where are you, Anthony? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the crisis that we're having right now in the US, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  at least the immediate crisis, is over, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  is such a ridiculous issue. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=120.28s)]
*  It's $5 billion of wall funding in a US federal budget [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  that is a trillion dollars. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=127.68s)]
*  I mean, this is a symbolic battle [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=129.76s)]
*  about the direction of the country, who [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=131.84s)]
*  gets to set political priorities, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  whether it's Donald Trump or the Democrats in Congress. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=135.84s)]
*  And larger, I think it kind of shows the systemic challenge [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=139.72s)]
*  with the American government right now, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=144.08s)]
*  where can we, as a divided nation, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=146.2s)]
*  where people have very different views, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=149.28s)]
*  can a government that inherently is usually divided, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=151.84s)]
*  where you have different parties controlling [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=155.4s)]
*  different parts of government, can that function [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=157.28s)]
*  without just grinding to a halt? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=159.88s)]
*  And I'm not sure it can. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=161.92s)]
*  Well, let me put this to you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=163.24s)]
*  I mean, I always remember when I was a reporter in the United [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=164.56s)]
*  States covering so many of Bill Clinton's speech. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=167.04s)]
*  I'm not sure if this one was after the Columbine school [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=170.12s)]
*  shooting or after the Oklahoma City bombing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=173.0s)]
*  But he said this, and I don't know [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=175.24s)]
*  whether he borrowed it from someone else, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=176.84s)]
*  but it really resonated with me, that that thing where, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  you know, he barks his lip. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=180.24s)]
*  And he said that there's nothing wrong about America. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=181.72s)]
*  That cannot be cured by what is right with America. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Immensely powerful. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=188.68s)]
*  I mean, do you think that's still true? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=189.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Clinton had a way with words. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=191.72s)]
*  And there, I mean, I will say, there are signs of silver lining. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=194.88s)]
*  There were compromises last year on criminal justice reform. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=199.44s)]
*  And there were signs that people could come across the aisle [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=202.68s)]
*  and cooperate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=205.28s)]
*  And maybe there is still the potential [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  that Americans have a short memory that we see a lot of conflicts [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=209.76s)]
*  right now, and they put it behind themselves and move on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=213.0s)]
*  And before you know it, something that seemed like a life or death [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=216.12s)]
*  battle, whether it's immigration now or trade now [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=219.04s)]
*  or anything like that, can change into, it's like a shrug. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=222.92s)]
*  It's like, oh, yeah, you know, this is no longer a big deal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=226.4s)]
*  We all agree on it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=228.8s)]
*  I mean, I guess that's one of the things you'd pick out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=230.36s)]
*  I'd certainly pick out from my American experience [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  the thing that I loved about living in the US [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  was that sort of the can-do spirit. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=236.28s)]
*  So no matter how many problems, sometimes self-inflicted, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  that America creates, it's also brilliant at coming up [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  with the solutions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  Whereas we here in the UK, our national slogan, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  I think a newspaper had a competition about this, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=249.12s)]
*  was mustn't grumble. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=251.36s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  I suspect I may be wrong, but it would [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=253.96s)]
*  be more difficult in the US. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to imagine an American leader who [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=257.16s)]
*  could sort of bring together people who [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  are super enthusiastic for Trump or people in big cities who [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=261.48s)]
*  had been super enthusiastic for Barack Obama. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=265.12s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=269.8s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=271.12s)]
*  One of the things that you see time and time again [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  with Donald Trump is the strength of his base. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=274.88s)]
*  It's not a huge percentage of the US population, 30% to 35%, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=277.88s)]
*  but they're sticking with him through thick and thin. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=282.44000000000005s)]
*  And even when Donald Trump is off the scene, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=284.96s)]
*  one way or the other, whether it's reelection or in 2020 [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  or if he's removed by some strange chance before then, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  Trumpism, the idea that there are [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=294.84s)]
*  people who are totally disenfranchised [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=297.0s)]
*  from the American political system, that's not changing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=298.96s)]
*  Anthony, I think we need to wrap it up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=302.2s)]
*  So I would just say this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=304.24s)]
*  When people always say to me, how is it all going to end, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  Rob? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=307.52s)]
*  How is this Brexit? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=307.76s)]
*  How is it all going to end? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=308.64s)]
*  And so I'm tempted to say what I often hear on the streets, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=310.24s)]
*  well, it'll probably be all right, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=312.76s)]
*  which is very British. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=314.36s)]
*  And to go back to that phrase we had at the start, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=315.28s)]
*  mustn't grumble. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=317.96s)]
*  What about you, Anthony? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=319.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, I think that eventually there'll be some sort [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=321.48s)]
*  of kicking the can down the road. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=325.68s)]
*  But the problems, the divides in the country [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Nr-0RZjmY&t=327.08s)]
