# False claims about Europe leaders' cocaine on a train to Ukraine. #France #UK #Germany #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI)
*  Why are there false viral claims that these political leaders were taking drugs while on a train to Ukraine? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=0.0s)]
*  This video of the British Prime Minister, French President and German Chancellor travelling to Kiev [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=5.5s)]
*  has been viewed over 85 million times across several online platforms. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=10.0s)]
*  Multiple users claim that this was a bag of cocaine and this was a spoon for the drug. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=14.5s)]
*  But higher quality photos and videos from media outlets show that this was actually tissue [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=20.0s)]
*  and this seems to be a small cocktail knot pick. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=25.0s)]
*  The alias false claims that we could find were posted by French online users, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=28.0s)]
*  hours after a media agency released the video. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=32.0s)]
*  The claims were also spread by at least two senior Russian officials, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=34.0s)]
*  as well as other prominent pro-Kremlin and conspiracy accounts, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=37.5s)]
*  including US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=40.5s)]
*  So, why make the claims? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=43.0s)]
*  Well, President Macron's office, which rejected the claims, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=45.0s)]
*  said it's an attempt by France's enemies to spread fake news and disinformation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=48.0s)]
*  There has been no response from the British or German leaders. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHXhRBQMTRI&t=52.5s)]
