# RFK Jr confirmed as US President Trump's health secretary by Senate | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc)
*  Right now, let's go to the US where Robert F Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=0.0s)]
*  The 71-year-old secured the nomination by a Senate vote of 52 to 48. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=7.0s)]
*  The confirmation paves the way for him to be sworn into the top health job overseeing multiple high-profile agencies. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=12.0s)]
*  And this is the moment the confirmation was announced in the Senate. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=19.0s)]
*  The yeas are 52, the nays are 48, the confirmation is confirmed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=23.0s)]
*  Let's go to our North America correspondent, Anthony Zirker, who's been following developments for us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=31.0s)]
*  Anthony, hello to you. A close-ish result of 52 for 48 against. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=37.0s)]
*  Does that reflect a lot of the controversy that's been around RFK and what he said in the past about vaccines? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, I think it reflects the divisions in the US Senate. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=50.0s)]
*  There are 53 Republicans. Only one Republican broke ranks and voted with all the Democrats, the 48 Democrats in the US Senate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=54.0s)]
*  That was Mitch McConnell, the senator from Kentucky, formerly a Republican leader in the US Senate. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=61.0s)]
*  He said that Kennedy had a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=67.0s)]
*  But this is another sign that Republicans, by and large, are sticking together to support Donald Trump's nominees to cabinet positions, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=76.0s)]
*  despite concerns about some of them, including RFK Jr., no matter how controversial they may be. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=85.0s)]
*  Yeah, although earlier, I think, Anthony, it's fair to say that Republican politicians alongside Democrats, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=91.0s)]
*  as well as the health and scientific community, had expressed concerns about his potential appointment. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=97.0s)]
*  So what does this actually mean now that he has been confirmed? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=103.0s)]
*  What does it mean for the health department? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=106.0s)]
*  What does it mean for the health services that the average American might receive? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=108.0s)]
*  Well, something to keep in mind is that the Department of Health and Human Services, which Kennedy is going to lead, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=114.0s)]
*  has been targeted for massive cuts by the Trump White House and Elon Musk and his Doge team. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=119.0s)]
*  So Kennedy is going to be taking over an embattled department that has, as you mentioned, a wide range of responsibilities, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=125.0s)]
*  including medical research, including food and drug regulation, and including managing health insurance, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=132.0s)]
*  government-run health insurance programs for the elderly and the low-income Americans. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=138.0s)]
*  So it's going to be a trying time there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=144.0s)]
*  There have already been massive resignations from some of the research centers, the Centers for Disease Research, for instance. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=146.0s)]
*  And that is going to be something that RFK Jr. is going to have to deal with. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=154.0s)]
*  He has said his priorities are going to be addressing what he says is too much processed foods in American diet, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=158.0s)]
*  removing food additives and chemicals that he says are dangerous to Americans, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=165.0s)]
*  and making America healthy again is his main catchphrase. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=171.0s)]
*  And, Anthony, Kash Patel is the man that President Trump wants to be the next director of the FBI. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=175.0s)]
*  He's going through the confirmation process, not at the stage that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is at. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=182.0s)]
*  Bring us up to date with what's been happening on that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=187.0s)]
*  He was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote of 12 to 10. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=190.0s)]
*  And once again, this was a straight party line vote. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=194.0s)]
*  All 12 Republicans supported him. All 10 Democrats opposed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=197.0s)]
*  Yet another piece of evidence that Republicans are sticking together to support Donald Trump's nominees, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=200.0s)]
*  even though Kash Patel is a very unconventional, to say the least, pick to head the FBI. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=206.0s)]
*  He has been very critical of the FBI in the past, says that it's politicized, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=211.0s)]
*  it's promised to root out individuals working in the department who, he says, are insufficiently loyal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=215.0s)]
*  or unqualified for their jobs. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=222.0s)]
*  Republicans seem to have shelved those concerns, put them aside, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=225.0s)]
*  and said that someone like Kash Patel would be a breath of fresh air to bring in to root out the corruption in the department. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=229.0s)]
*  Okay, Anthony, thank you very much for that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=236.0s)]
*  Anthony Zirka there in Washington for us. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2PfIJj1Mc&t=238.0s)]
