**BBC - World News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ)
*  All that is left for their families to remember, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the faded photos of their missing children. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=5.0s)]
*  Human rights organizations in Syria say hundreds disappeared under the Assad regime. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=11.0s)]
*  For many, their fate is still unknown. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=17.0s)]
*  Desperate to find them, relatives gathered so their cause is not forgotten. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=21.0s)]
*  I went to visit Atiyah El-Moussa and his wife Ghazia, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=30.0s)]
*  who are searching for traces of their missing daughter, Hiba, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=36.0s)]
*  and her two girls, Sham and Islam. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=40.0s)]
*  They were four and five. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=43.0s)]
*  They were taken in 2014 while living in a suburb of Damascus, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=46.0s)]
*  when security forces raided their house, taking 14 people, including seven children. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=50.0s)]
*  We searched in security branches. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=61.0s)]
*  We were told they are in state security, but not sure. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=63.0s)]
*  Somebody told me that some girls were sent from detention centers to Lahna Al-Hayat orphanage, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=67.0s)]
*  but they denied having them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=73.0s)]
*  No one is helping us, neither the Ministry of Social Affairs nor the orphanages. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=77.0s)]
*  We lost our daughter. Are we going to lose her daughters too? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=82.0s)]
*  In the archives in the basement of the Ministry, the files look dusty, messy and untouched. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=86.0s)]
*  Hard to tell how to start the search. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=92.0s)]
*  Mr. Ahmed Anizi is newly appointed to the task. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=95.0s)]
*  He showed us letters that provide clues to what happened to some of the children. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=99.0s)]
*  This is a sample of some of the documents they found showing orders by Air Force security [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=104.0s)]
*  to the Ministry of Social Affairs, to the governor, to hand over children to various orphanages. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=112.0s)]
*  Some of the names I looked at, the children were taken. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=119.0s)]
*  They were aged one year old or two years old. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=123.0s)]
*  Mask graves are being regularly discovered across the country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=127.0s)]
*  In this basement of a building, the bodies have been burned. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=131.0s)]
*  For parents who are looking for a place to hide, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=135.0s)]
*  their greatest fear is that their remains may be found among those graves. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=138.0s)]
*  We visited Lahni al-Hayat orphanage, home to around 130 children of all ages. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=145.0s)]
*  It is now under the new administration. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=153.0s)]
*  Mr. Mu'tasem Saloumi is the new director. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=157.0s)]
*  I asked him whether he knows any of the children, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=160.0s)]
*  and he said he knows them all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=163.0s)]
*  He is the new director. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=165.0s)]
*  I asked him whether he knows anything about the case of Shaman Islam. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=167.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=175.0s)]
*  But I learned that many families used to come here looking for their children. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=177.0s)]
*  We welcome any family here. We want to help. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=182.0s)]
*  For Atiya and Ghazi, this might not be comforting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=185.0s)]
*  But for some of the children here, there is now a better chance to be found. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-PAM4_nNQ&t=189.0s)]
