Video Description: The heads of six UN aid agencies have called for an urgent renewal of a ceasefire in Gaza, saying the ongoing violence shows “a complete disregard for human life”.
 
It comes as the Palestinian Red Crescent has renewed calls for an independent international investigation into Israel’s killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza.
 
A new statement from the Israeli army said that a preliminary inquiry indicated that troops "opened fire due to a perceived threat" and that "six of the individuals killed in the incident were identified as Hamas terrorists", without giving evidence.

# UN aid agencies call for renewed ceasefire in Gaza after Israel's killing of medics | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI)
*  The heads of six UN aid agencies are calling for an urgent renewal of a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=0.0s)]
*  The group said in a statement that the violence taking place in Gaza shows quote, an utter [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  disregard for human life, adding that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been ordered [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=11.8s)]
*  to evacuate once again but have nowhere safe to go. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=16.78s)]
*  It comes as the Palestinian Red Crescent has renewed calls for an independent international [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=20.68s)]
*  investigation into Israel's killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza two weeks [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=25.3s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=30.86s)]
*  The head of the organisation has described the killing as deliberate. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=31.86s)]
*  Israel has admitted fault in its initial account, claiming that vehicles approached without [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=35.5s)]
*  lights was untrue. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=40.3s)]
*  A new statement from the Israeli army says that a preliminary inquiry indicates that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=41.78s)]
*  the troops opened fire due to a perceived threat and six of the individuals killed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=46.78s)]
*  were identified as Hamas members. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=51.74s)]
*  Here's our international editor, Jeremy Bowen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=54.78s)]
*  It took a week to recover the bodies of the 15 paramedics and emergency workers killed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=59.34s)]
*  by the Israeli army in southern Gaza. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=64.7s)]
*  They'd been buried in a mass grave along with their wrecked vehicles. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  What happened, why and how they were killed, is the latest episode in the long running [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=72.62s)]
*  controversy about the conduct of Israel's troops in Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=79.32s)]
*  The bodies of the dead were brought back to the nearest hospital along with a mobile dug [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=85.36s)]
*  up from the grave containing video evidence that has forced Israel to retract its original [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  claim that its soldiers opened fire at a suspicious convoy approaching in darkness without headlights [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=94.96s)]
*  or emergency signals. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  The Palestinian Red Crescent is demanding an independent investigation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=104.4s)]
*  Rifat Radwan, one of the Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics killed in the attack, filmed a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=135.28s)]
*  video in the last few minutes of his life that has raised all those questions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=141.24s)]
*  It was on his phone found in the mass grave near his body. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  It shows that the convoy was clearly marked with emergency lights illuminated and men [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  in high vis clothing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=156.74s)]
*  The shooting went on for five minutes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=160.9s)]
*  Rifat Radwan's last prayers can be heard under the gunfire. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=163.36s)]
*  Israel is still insisting without offering evidence that what it calls six Hamas terrorists [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=168.52s)]
*  were among the men they killed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=174.0s)]
*  Ehud Olmert, a former Israeli Prime Minister, questioned the official version. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=175.8s)]
*  My judgement and my impression is that it smells. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=181.16000000000003s)]
*  It smells of a cover up. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=185.44000000000003s)]
*  It smells of something that sounds and looks very bad for the way that the Israeli military [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=187.12s)]
*  unit conducted itself. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=195.0s)]
*  This was the funeral of the Red Crescent workers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=198.76s)]
*  At least 408 humanitarians have been killed in this war, according to the UN and Gaza, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=201.6s)]
*  which said today that they're witnessing acts of war that show an utter disregard for human [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=208.0s)]
*  life. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=213.08s)]
*  Israel now admits that its soldiers made mistakes when they attacked the convoy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=215.56s)]
*  It consistently denies it commits war crimes in Gaza. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=220.11999999999998s)]
*  The evidence indicates that all the warring parties have done so. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  Jeremy Bowen, BBC News. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=229.28s)]
*  Let's bring in Israel's former ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, for more. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  Ambassador, very good to have you with us here in the studio. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  I'd just like to start with the comments that we've had from six UN agencies today that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  have been calling for a renewed ceasefire. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=245.04s)]
*  They've said the violence in Gaza shows, in their words, a disregard for human life. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=247.72s)]
*  They've added that hundreds of Palestinians have been ordered to leave, but they've said [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=252.56s)]
*  they've got nowhere safe to go to. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=257.32s)]
*  With Israel's renewed offensive in Gaza, do you think this brings both sides closer to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=259.88s)]
*  a ceasefire? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=265.92s)]
*  Good to be with you, Helena. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=266.92s)]
*  What's missing, I can hear from these UN pronouncements, is any mention of Hamas or the hostages. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=268.48s)]
*  Hamas has kept, has kept and kept on under unspeakable conditions in Gaza. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=275.08s)]
*  So they want a ceasefire, everybody wants a ceasefire, but we want the hostages back. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=279.36s)]
*  And just to have a ceasefire without getting the hostages back simply lets Hamas come out [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=284.08s)]
*  and retake Gaza. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=287.8s)]
*  In recent weeks we've seen very large demonstrations by Palestinians against Hamas. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=289.44s)]
*  And I think the UN should show some care for those Palestinians as well who have been living [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=293.32s)]
*  under Hamas oppression and understand that what has occurred in Gaza, and they're right [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=296.96s)]
*  in the sense that it's an enormous and immense tragedy for everyone involved. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=302.78s)]
*  But this was brought on by Hamas, by Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th by the massacre [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=308.46s)]
*  of 1200 of our citizens, rape, beheading and burning of our citizens and the hostage taking [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=313.34s)]
*  of 252 of them, 59 of whom remain in captivity. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=319.3s)]
*  We hope that 24 are still alive. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  And on that point as well, with the prospect of course, those hostages still being in Gaza [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=325.58s)]
*  in those conditions, we know also that for the humanitarian situation there continues [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=333.02s)]
*  to be dire for everyone there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you think that that meaningfully, that renewed offensive means that those hostages [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=341.82s)]
*  will come out? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's a very hard question. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm not a spokesman for the government. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=347.78s)]
*  And these issues in Israel are even contentious. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=349.58s)]
*  A large percentage of the Israeli population think that the Israeli government should go [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=351.58s)]
*  further and make more concessions to Hamas in order to get the hostages back, with the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  assumption that after the ceasefire, Hamas will violate the ceasefire and then the Israeli [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=359.22s)]
*  army can go back in and take care of Hamas. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=363.1s)]
*  That's a very large percentage of the Israeli population believes just what I just said. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=366.46s)]
*  Having said that, the government is proceeding on the assumption that by ramping up the military [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=370.78000000000003s)]
*  pressure on Hamas, it will force them back to the negotiating table. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=376.1s)]
*  And so far the indications that that may be working. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=379.98s)]
*  Hamas is showing a willingness to come back and negotiate, as far as I know. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=382.14s)]
*  On the table is an Egyptian proposal of a prolonged ceasefire, as much as 70 days in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=386.58s)]
*  return for something like seven hostages alive. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  There's an American proposal of the envoy Steve Witkoff, which calls for a 50-day ceasefire [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=394.42s)]
*  in return for the release of 11 living hostages. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=400.22s)]
*  This is on the table. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=404.46000000000004s)]
*  And the fact that it's being discussed at all may indicate that the military pressure [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  is working. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=409.3s)]
*  I want to talk about some of the events that we've seen recently in the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=410.3s)]
*  The Israeli military changed its account of the IODF's killing of 15 emergency workers [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  because of that video evidence that came to light. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=422.54s)]
*  And the Red Crescent, when we've spoken to them, have said that they believe that aid [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=425.70000000000005s)]
*  workers are being targeted. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=429.34000000000003s)]
*  After seeing the evidence, what do you think happened? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=431.74s)]
*  Well, first of all, they got the version wrong. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=433.90000000000003s)]
*  I saw the clip that was in the New York Times that shows that these vehicles were flashing [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=436.42s)]
*  red lights. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  But the Israeli military has also said that they knew that six of those people killed [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  were Hamas operatives. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=444.54s)]
*  Now, Hamas has used ambulances over and over again and used even medical personnel over [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=445.54s)]
*  and over again to disguise terrorists. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=451.14s)]
*  None of those killed were armed. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=452.62s)]
*  Well, they aren't. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=454.34s)]
*  But according to the Israeli, I have to take the IDF's count into the equation here. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=455.34s)]
*  And until disproven, the IDF has said that six of them were terrorists. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=461.98s)]
*  If six of them were terrorists, then everything is complicit in that whole scenario. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=465.46s)]
*  We don't know yet, and it's still being investigated. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=470.26s)]
*  Prior to coming on the program tonight, I called the IDF spokesman, and that was the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=472.34000000000003s)]
*  response I got. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=476.5s)]
*  It's still being investigated. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=477.5s)]
*  They can't give a version until it's been investigated. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=478.5s)]
*  Did he indicate that there would be an international investigation allowed in? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=480.22s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=484.78000000000003s)]
*  And that's not been Israel's position for a long time, that we have a judicial system [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=485.98s)]
*  that's capable of judging itself and conducting that investigation. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=490.66s)]
*  And in the past, investigations have been conducted in cases where aid workers have [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=494.22s)]
*  been killed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=498.9s)]
*  And keep in mind that we're dealing in a war situation, and I've been in situations [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  like this, where it's intensely, intensely confusing and very frightening. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=504.22s)]
*  About 20 percent of all of our casualties, our military casualties, are caused by friendly [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=508.62s)]
*  fire. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=512.5s)]
*  We've shot our own people by accident, never mind other people. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=513.5s)]
*  But in this thug of war, we have seen the highest level of aid worker casualties in [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=515.9s)]
*  2024 in any conflict. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=520.22s)]
*  Why would Israel be resistant to allow international observers in if that is the situation? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=522.86s)]
*  I think that it's not going to be... [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=529.42s)]
*  First of all, I don't know if that's correct about the aid workers, but let's assume that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=530.66s)]
*  it is, that there's a disproportionate number of aid workers. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=534.26s)]
*  Aid workers are operating in a war zone. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=536.98s)]
*  And in a war zone, there are dangers. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=539.42s)]
*  Especially in a war zone, there was a very... [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=540.9399999999999s)]
*  But they are protected with banners such as the Red Crescent, the Red Cross, international [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=542.26s)]
*  humanitarian law. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=545.98s)]
*  In a previous war, I was in a convoy in broad daylight with Israeli banners, and we were [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=546.98s)]
*  bombed by Israeli jets. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=552.7s)]
*  I think we've probably seen more Israelis killed by Israeli forces than actually been [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=553.9s)]
*  an enemy. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=557.3s)]
*  So this happens in war. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=558.3s)]
*  This is tremendously confusing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=560.2199999999999s)]
*  And, yes, every army, including the Israeli army, could always do more to minimize the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=561.2199999999999s)]
*  dangers to international workers. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=566.3s)]
*  But keep in mind, this is a war unlike any army has ever encountered, not only in a densely [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=568.9s)]
*  populated area of over 2 million people, a military force which at outset was about 30,000 [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=574.78s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=580.9s)]
*  Now it's probably about 50,000 to 20,000 terrorists, and 500 miles of tunnels underneath. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=581.9s)]
*  No army in history, certainly not the British army, has ever encountered anything like it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=587.46s)]
*  Michael Orrin, Ambassador, thank you so very much for being with us. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6DR89YBHWI&t=591.34s)]
