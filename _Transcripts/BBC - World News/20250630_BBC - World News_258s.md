# Freed Belarus opposition figure speaks out after five years in prison | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4)
*  My daughter hadn't seen me since she was four years old. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=0.0s)]
*  She didn't recognize me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  She burst into tears and threw herself into my arms. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And we spent a lot of time like that together, hugging each other. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  In the last two and a half years I was in total isolation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=38.8s)]
*  They even kept the nearby cells empty so no one could hear me. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=42.8s)]
*  I didn't get a single letter in almost three years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=47.8s)]
*  For almost three years they didn't let me have any phone calls. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=51.8s)]
*  I wasn't allowed to see a lawyer. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=55.4s)]
*  I couldn't get tea, coffee. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=58.4s)]
*  I got no toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, nothing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=60.4s)]
*  It was the same for many other political prisoners. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=64.4s)]
*  The one they think are most dangerous or who they want to destroy in prison. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=67.4s)]
*  What was it physically like in the cell? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=72.4s)]
*  When they were giving me extra punishment, the cell could be three square meters, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=75.4s)]
*  which includes a hole in the floor for a toilet. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=81.4s)]
*  A small cell where there's no mattress, no sheets and no pillows. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=86.4s)]
*  It's really cold. You have to get up at night to keep warm. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=91.4s)]
*  How did you cope mentally? How did you keep going? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=94.4s)]
*  What did you cling to to survive? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=98.4s)]
*  I realized that I need to put all personal thoughts to one side about my family and children. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=102.4s)]
*  I knew they were abroad and safe, so I had to set those thoughts aside [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=109.4s)]
*  and just wait for the moment of my release and read books. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=114.4s)]
*  Because if you start to think about your family and what's happening to them, you won't survive. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=118.4s)]
*  That's why when I saw Svetlana and the children, you can imagine how hard it hit me. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=123.4s)]
*  I had pushed everything to one side for so many years to hold it together [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=129.4s)]
*  that I was overwhelmed by emotion. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=134.4s)]
*  What was the worst thing for you? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=139.4s)]
*  For some reason, the hardest restriction for me was the lack of freedom to speak. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=142.4s)]
*  I had never felt that before I went to prison. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=147.4s)]
*  But when you can't say anything or write, can't even talk to anyone and you are just trapped in that cell, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=150.4s)]
*  it's not the lack of free movement that's the real issue. It's the lack of speech. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=158.4s)]
*  That was the toughest thing for some reason, the most painful. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=163.4s)]
*  Were they trying to break you? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=167.4s)]
*  They'd say, you will die in prison. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=170.4s)]
*  We're going to keep extending your time constantly and you won't get out. You'll die here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=175.4s)]
*  Why do you think Lukashenko agreed to this? What do you think he's getting from this? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=180.4s)]
*  It's very simple. For about five years, no US diplomats had been to Belarus and now they came. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=187.4s)]
*  So Lukashenko could show he was starting some cooperation with them, a dialogue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=195.4s)]
*  And they got to take political prisoners when they left, including me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=200.4s)]
*  That was the price, the start of contact with him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=204.4s)]
*  Do you think he should get something so that the others can be freed? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=208.4s)]
*  If it depended on me, I would give anything at all, because I think we should pay any price at all, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=212.4s)]
*  to get those people out. But of course, I don't want them to remove the sanctions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=220.4s)]
*  I didn't recognize you when I saw you. Physically you've changed hugely. Have you changed as a person as well? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=226.4s)]
*  I'm the same. Yes, physically I'm half the size, half and half the weight. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=233.4s)]
*  You can see how thin my face is, but my spirit is not broken. It may even be stronger, if that's possible. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=242.4s)]
*  I'm the same person I always was, ready to fight, for victory even. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTF-PBQywv4&t=249.4s)]
