Video Description: Geoff Whaley had motor neurone disease and decided to end his life rather than experience the final stages of the illness.
Assisted suicide is illegal in the UK, so he and his wife Ann travelled to a clinic in Switzerland.
They had been campaigning to try to get the UK to change its law, and met peers and MPs to explain their views.
The couple spoke to BBC Home Editor Mark Easton during Geoff's final days.

# Assisted dying: 'I just wish the law let me have him for a little longer' - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI)
*  I mean when you've got a husband as brave as mine, you have to, you have to support [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=0.0s)]
*  him. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=13.32s)]
*  Mind your head. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=14.32s)]
*  Mind your head. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=15.32s)]
*  Sorry darling. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=16.32s)]
*  Mind your head. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=17.32s)]
*  Sorry darling. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=18.32s)]
*  It is one of the things that I've been doing for a long time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=19.32s)]
*  This is one of the illnesses that really you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy, particularly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=28.96s)]
*  the final weeks or possibly months which are or can be particularly gruesome. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=35.56s)]
*  And I decided that I didn't really want to go through that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=44.4s)]
*  One, two, three, up. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=50.48s)]
*  We were quite reconciled to that and I know that Anne was reconciled to the fact that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  she may be interviewed when she came back. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=61.44s)]
*  Can you give a push up darling? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=63.44s)]
*  That's most unusual and that's because an anonymous call was received by the social [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=68.44s)]
*  services and it's the police's job in the domestic abuse unit to follow that up. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  There was a police woman and a detective sergeant and they were clearly not expecting to find [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=79.84s)]
*  a non-abusive situation because they were very embarrassed about the whole thing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=87.72s)]
*  Please log in. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=92.44s)]
*  No, no it's not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=94.44s)]
*  Sorry, I pressed the wrong button. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=96.44s)]
*  It's manage, manage your booking. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=98.44s)]
*  His final limb had gone and he could no longer do anything for himself at all, not even the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=101.52s)]
*  slightest bit of help. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=106.88s)]
*  He can't hold a phone, he can't press numbers, he can't feed himself, whereas before he [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=108.38s)]
*  could hold a glass of gin and tonic, even if I put a straw in it he could do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=114.22s)]
*  So you have had to make a decision as to whether to, in legal terms, assist Geoff to commit suicide? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=119.14s)]
*  I didn't think of it like that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=128.42s)]
*  If my husband says to me, now I want you to make this phone call for me, what am I expected [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  to do? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=135.94s)]
*  Have an argument with him? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=136.94s)]
*  I couldn't do that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=137.94s)]
*  No, if he said, ring this hotel, ring this airline, which is what he did, of course I [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=139.54s)]
*  did it for him. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=147.18s)]
*  The first responsibility is to decide, and this is quite right, is to decide whether [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=148.34s)]
*  I'm a sort of person in a full mental state and having established that I thought that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=153.74s)]
*  would be the end of it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=160.9s)]
*  I've never seen Geoff cry in 52 years of married life but I found him with his head in his [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=162.02s)]
*  hand and he was just sobbing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=167.3s)]
*  He said, everything that I've worked for to protect you has all been blown apart by this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  anonymous phone call. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=176.26s)]
*  Having been at peace with myself and family for the last two years, I became completely [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=178.12s)]
*  terrified that the control was going to be taken away from me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=183.7s)]
*  If it is impossible, the Australians and the Canadians and people in the States are all idiots. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=189.42s)]
*  Knowing he was in control of his end, we could put it in a box and we could get on and live [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=196.61999999999998s)]
*  as normal as possible. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=202.61999999999998s)]
*  A good grandfather, yeah, but poor children. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=203.61999999999998s)]
*  How important is it for you that you have this legacy after you're dead of the law [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=208.61999999999998s)]
*  perhaps changing or at least the debate changing? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=216.61999999999998s)]
*  Geronimo, that would be absolutely fantastic. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=219.22s)]
*  Absolutely fantastic. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=223.22s)]
*  I want the Act to be designed so that any rational person who is in full control of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=225.02s)]
*  his mind makes that decision can be helped in any way by other people without any fear [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=234.02s)]
*  of prosecution. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=242.02s)]
*  For some people, the moment of your passing is a matter for the Almighty and not for you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=245.02s)]
*  It's a religious field. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=252.02s)]
*  Do you not respect that view? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  Oh, erm, erm, it's a difficult one because I always respect people's views but I expect [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  to be able to participate in a debate with them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=267.82s)]
*  I mean, when you've got a husband as brave as mine, you have to, you have to support [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=271.62s)]
*  him. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=281.62s)]
*  He's the one who's being strong for me. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=282.62s)]
*  He really is. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=285.62s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=286.62s)]
*  I just want him, I just want him to be here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=289.62s)]
*  But I know that what he has chosen to do is the right thing for him. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=296.42s)]
*  I wouldn't put an animal through what he would go through if he went to the end. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=301.42s)]
*  I just wish the Lord would allow me to have him for a little longer. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=307.42s)]
*  I really do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLaF5uDJeDI&t=310.42s)]
