*  You're live with BBC News. I'm Suviso Mascando. Welcome to our special coverage of President [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=224.12s)]
*  Trump's address to Congress this evening. Now, just a few minutes from now, the action begins. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=236.72s)]
*  President Donald Trump will leave the White House to address both chambers of Congress for the first [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=241.88s)]
*  time since his return to office. Let's show you some live pictures from Capitol Hill tonight. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=246.96s)]
*  This is a chance for the president to tout his early achievements and lay out his agenda for the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=252.28s)]
*  next four years. You can see images of statutory hall here, of course. Huge media interest, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=257.56s)]
*  including the BBC, of course, lined up there. We will be speaking to lawmakers tonight and getting [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  analysis throughout the course of the night. This speech comes during Donald Trump's whirlwind [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=268.2s)]
*  return to office, which started less than 50 days ago and has already started to reshape the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=273.2s)]
*  federal government fundamentally. Now, inside the packed chamber, the president will be flanked by [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=279.04s)]
*  the Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnson, and the vice president, J.D. Vance, who is also the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  ceremonial president of the Senate. Now, listening to the address will be Republican lawmakers who [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=289.98s)]
*  have mostly rallied around the president's agenda and Democrats who have so far struggled to counter [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  that agenda. But Mr. Trump will also be addressing the American people who delivered him a decisive [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  victory last November. And the wider world will be watching too, of course, especially after Mr. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=307.48s)]
*  Trump's recent moves on international trade and the war in Ukraine. It is also a crucial night for [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=313.0s)]
*  Democrats. They will be delivering a rebuttal speech. That is the party's first big chance to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=318.92s)]
*  counter the president's vision on. Well, let's go right to the Capitol. Our correspondent, Helen [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=323.72s)]
*  Humphrey, is covering all of this for us tonight. Helena, very good to see you. Take us to what we [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  can expect to happen tonight. Sumi, on Truth Social ahead of this address, Donald Trump has promised [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=333.08s)]
*  to the nation that he will tell it like it is. And of course, strictly speaking, this isn't a State of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=340.52s)]
*  the Union address, but nevertheless, I think he will use it as a prime time platform to essentially [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=345.96s)]
*  tout what he sees as a long list of achievements since returning to the White House some six weeks [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=352.68s)]
*  ago. Now, of course, audiences will be tuning in for answers to different questions. Internationally, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=358.76s)]
*  of course, that looming question when it comes to Ukraine, a day after the Trump administration [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=365.4s)]
*  said that it would be pausing military aid to that country. According to reporting from the Reuters [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=370.36s)]
*  news agency, the president wants to be able to say that that minerals deal, that minerals deal [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  that was left on the table when President Zelensky hastily departed from the White House after that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  falling out. He wants to be able to say that that will be signed. We haven't had a secondary [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=388.2s)]
*  confirmation as to whether that will be the case. But I think domestically, what you'll find, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=392.84s)]
*  audiences tuning in for those key issues of immigration, but specifically the economy, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=397.96s)]
*  according to CBS polling, that is the most important issues to Americans on either side of the aisle, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=403.0s)]
*  whatever their political stripe. And again, on a day where we've seen that shaky reaction on the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=409.96s)]
*  markets in the U.S. and Europe to those announced tariffs on Mexico and Canada, also at a time when [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=415.08s)]
*  we've heard from the likes, he expects grocery prices being imported from Mexico to actually [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  go up when they hit the shelves here in the United States. In terms of who is in the room, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=427.08s)]
*  always really important to take a look at the guests, the family members of Lakin Riley, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=431.88s)]
*  the Georgia nursing student who was murdered by a man from Venezuela. They will be there, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=437.56s)]
*  expected to highlight once again the concentration when it comes to the topic [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=443.64s)]
*  of immigration. On the Democratic side, it will be really interesting as well to see the response [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=449.32s)]
*  in the room. I'm sure you'll recall, Sumi, what we saw in 2020 following Donald Trump's last [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=454.44s)]
*  address to Congress, and that was then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ripping up his speech [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=460.12s)]
*  thereafter. Of course, this time around, the Democrats are in a very different position, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=466.12s)]
*  and this is their chance. For the first time really in 43 days since Donald Trump came back [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=470.6s)]
*  to the White House to set out that alternative vision, and speaking to senators here, the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=475.88s)]
*  thinking perhaps that economy might also be an issue that they choose to concentrate on. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=481.72s)]
*  All right, Helena Humphrey, setting the stage for us there at the Capitol. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=487.8s)]
*  Helena, we'll come back to you a little bit later in the hour. Thank you so much. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=490.92s)]
*  Well, it has been a fast-paced start to President Trump's second term. He has been in office for [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  just over six weeks, 43 days to be exact. In that time, he signed 76 executive orders from [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=500.2s)]
*  tightening immigration enforcement to withdrawing from the World Health Organization and the Paris [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=507.24s)]
*  Climate Accords. Many of these orders have faced legal challenges, and some are stalled in the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=511.8s)]
*  courts. Now, the administration fired thousands of federal workers or placed them on leave [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=517.88s)]
*  and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Government [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=523.88s)]
*  Efficiency led by billionaire Elon Musk says it's aimed at slashing bureaucracy and wasteful [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=528.44s)]
*  spending. While talks to end the war in Ukraine still hang very much in the balance as after we [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  heard their tensions boiled over between President Zelensky and President Trump at the White House [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=540.6s)]
*  last week. In the Middle East, President Trump's proposal to redevelop Gaza and resettle Palestinians [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=546.12s)]
*  was resoundingly rejected by Arab countries. Now, in terms of trade today, new tariffs on goods [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=552.0400000000001s)]
*  entering the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China came into effect, prompting retaliation from all [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=558.28s)]
*  three countries and descending the stock market plummeting. In Washington, House Republicans passed [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=564.68s)]
*  a budget bill which President Trump hailed as a victory for his legislative agenda but faces an [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=570.28s)]
*  uphill battle in the Senate. It calls for deep federal spending cuts and tax breaks for wealthy [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=575.16s)]
*  Americans. And what many Americans will be looking for in tonight's speech is reassurance on the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=580.92s)]
*  economy. Stubborn inflation and the high cost of living continue to top people's concerns. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=586.12s)]
*  All right, let's talk about some of that now with our first guest of the evening, Republican [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=592.12s)]
*  Congressman from North Carolina, Chuck Edwards, who is joining us from the Capitol tonight. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=595.8s)]
*  Congressman, always good to see you. Thanks for joining us again here on BBC News. Just to start, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=600.2s)]
*  what are you expecting or hoping to hear from the President tonight? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=605.16s)]
*  Congressman Edwards, how do you feel about the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=608.2s)]
*  election? Well, first of all, I am feeling a lot of energy here in Washington, D.C. There's a level [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=613.48s)]
*  of optimism that has been missing for the 26 months that I've served in Congress. And what I [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=619.0s)]
*  expect that we're going to hear is a very energized president with a very clear path to help America [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=625.6400000000001s)]
*  get back on track. Let's talk about that path to get back on track. We were just mentioning [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=633.24s)]
*  inflation and the economy. We know that since the tariffs were announced on the U.S.'s neighbors, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  Mexico and Canada, we've seen stocks tumble. There are concerns that there could be a big price hike [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=644.28s)]
*  for consumers. Is this something you're concerned about for your constituents? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=649.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think we need to understand the president that we have elected. He is the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=653.96s)]
*  author of the great book, The Art of the Deal. And these tariffs, I consider an opening move [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=665.4000000000001s)]
*  for us to get into negotiations with our bordering countries, with those folks who [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  we are concerned with, in order to show our strength and insist that Canada protect [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=680.68s)]
*  our northern border and Mexico do the part to protect our southern border. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=688.4399999999999s)]
*  These are just opening moves. These are not the final products. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=694.1999999999999s)]
*  So you don't expect these tariffs to stay in place, is what you're saying? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=697.7199999999999s)]
*  I think there is room for discussion. And yeah, these are just the opening steps. I expect that [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=700.28s)]
*  we're going to be having some folks from Canada at the negotiating table with President Trump. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=717.88s)]
*  We're going to see folks from Mexico at the table. And it may take a few weeks. It may take a few [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=723.0799999999999s)]
*  months. But this is an effort to show America's strength and to leverage the power of the rest of [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=729.0s)]
*  the world to help us protect our borders and regain our position in the world. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=737.48s)]
*  What about some of the cuts that we've seen initiated by the Department of Government [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=745.24s)]
*  Efficiency? We know that there is support for cutting waste at big federal agencies. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=749.72s)]
*  From what I saw, according to the OPM, there are 51,000 federal workers in your state of North [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=754.76s)]
*  Carolina. Is this something that you're concerned about, these cuts of federal workers that are [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=759.88s)]
*  affecting people as well? What I'm most concerned about is the debt that is spiraling out of control [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=766.52s)]
*  in America. We now have a debt of $36 trillion, and that's well on the path to be over $50 trillion [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=777.64s)]
*  in just a few years. Americans have demanded that we reverse the spending here in America. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=787.48s)]
*  And these are bold steps, and they've created some uncomfortability in some places. Change always [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=794.68s)]
*  creates a level of anxiety. We're going to see a few pressure points that we have to go back and [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=803.56s)]
*  reanalyze. But these are bold steps for us to get our country back on track fiscally. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=810.76s)]
*  All right. And we do also want to ask you, Congressman, as we've spoken to you about [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=818.52s)]
*  the war in Ukraine in the past, we saw this message from President Zelensky today. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=822.76s)]
*  Do you want to see weapons assistance to Ukraine resumed? What do you want to see [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=828.76s)]
*  between the U.S. and Ukraine going forward? What I'd like to see is the same thing that [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=833.32s)]
*  President Trump has said that he wanted to see, and that is peace, to put a stop to the killing, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=842.52s)]
*  the needless killing that's taking place in Ukraine right now. And once again, I believe that what we [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=849.48s)]
*  see President Trump doing is getting Russia and Ukraine to the table to negotiate in a way [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=856.68s)]
*  that is far, far overdue. These are steps by the author of the art of the deal [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=864.5999999999999s)]
*  to get folks to the negotiating table. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=874.4399999999999s)]
*  All right, Congressman. Well, we'll let you get over and, of course, take your seat ahead of the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=877.3199999999999s)]
*  address that we'll be starting a little bit later. But thank you so much for joining us tonight on [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=880.52s)]
*  BBC News. Okay, a big part of looking at this address is who's in attendance. So let's take a [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=884.2s)]
*  look at that as well. Members of the president's cabinet will be in attendance. That is, of course, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=891.88s)]
*  a tradition. Several Supreme Court justices will also be on hand. Now, a big feature of an address [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=898.6s)]
*  to Congress and also a State of the Union address, of course, as we heard, this is not a State of the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=905.96s)]
*  Union address, but we see special guests invited by both parties and members of Congress past and [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=910.36s)]
*  present also attend. Seated right behind President Trump on the dais, by tradition, will be the vice [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=916.92s)]
*  president, J.D. Vance, and the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. Now, President Trump's wife, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=923.0s)]
*  Melania, will invite special guests to sit with her in the First Lady box overlooking the House [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=929.48s)]
*  floor, and they will have a significant part of the president's speech as well. And one cabinet [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=935.24s)]
*  member will be missing. That person is the designated survivor, and that person will sit [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=940.2s)]
*  out the speech in a secure location to preserve the presidential line of succession in case of a [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=944.28s)]
*  catastrophic event in the House chamber. That's a ritual going back to the Civil War. Now, after [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=949.4s)]
*  the address, we can expect an on-camera response from the Democratic Party, and that's going to be [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=955.24s)]
*  the Michigan Senator, Alyssa Slotkin. And you can see here all of the action here in Statutory Hall. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=961.48s)]
*  Of course, we're going to see the buzz continue to grow ahead of the speech. We know, of course, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=966.84s)]
*  from the president's team, they've given us some hints as to what we can expect. That the president [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=973.8000000000001s)]
*  will be speaking about a number of his achievements. As Caroline Levitt, the press secretary, has said [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=978.6s)]
*  what he has achieved in his first weeks in office will also be setting out an agenda. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=984.52s)]
*  We're expecting the president to touch heavily, of course, on the economy and also immigration. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=989.96s)]
*  We know that those are two big themes of the election, and he's expected to talk heavily [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=995.8000000000001s)]
*  about both of those two issues tonight. So we were just talking about the Democrats. Let's bring in [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1000.7600000000001s)]
*  our guest, Representative Gabe Amow, Democratic congressman from Rhode Island, who's joining us. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1006.2s)]
*  Congressman, good to see you again. What are you hoping, expecting to hear from the president tonight? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1011.1600000000001s)]
*  REP. GABE AMOW, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1019.32s)]
*  What I'm expecting to hear from President Trump is a continuation of the falsehoods, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1022.12s)]
*  the lies that he has brought forth about his administration and a continuation of his attack [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1028.68s)]
*  on the things that Americans care about, which is Medicaid, which are the essential federal services, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1036.2s)]
*  feeding programs through SNAP, making sure that we have less chaos, and he is ensuring that we are [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1043.8799999999999s)]
*  having more chaos. And so we will continue to see the president talk about renewal, but what I'm [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1052.52s)]
*  seeing is an American reversal, a reversal of policies that have moved us ahead, and this is [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1058.52s)]
*  a challenge that we are going to have to overcome. Congressman, what the Trump administration says is [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1064.9199999999998s)]
*  that the president is simply executing the agenda that he promised to and that the Democrats [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1070.2s)]
*  can't keep up. What's your response to that? REP. GABE AMOW, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1075.48s)]
*  Well, I don't believe that to be true. He promised that prices would go down on day one. Instead, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1082.92s)]
*  he has led an agenda of tariffs being raised on Canada and Mexico, two of our key trading partners, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1089.96s)]
*  and we're going to feel it at the grocery store. We're going to feel it at the gas pump. That is [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1097.72s)]
*  inconsistent with the wishes of the American people, and I think that we're going to hear tonight [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1102.28s)]
*  falsehoods about that being progress. That is only moving our country back and hurting people, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1107.72s)]
*  not lowering costs. That is the opposite of what the American people want, and we'll be fighting [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1112.92s)]
*  against that as Democrats. REP. GABE AMOW, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1118.84s)]
*  What message do you think Democrats need to send right now? I know that some of your colleagues [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1120.68s)]
*  have decided, for example, not to attend the speech tonight. Why did you decide to attend, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1125.4s)]
*  and what message do you think you need to send? REP. GABE AMOW, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1131.4s)]
*  I think the message we need to send is the impact on our constituents around the country. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1138.92s)]
*  I brought as a special guest with me someone who runs a nursing home in my home state of Rhode [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1143.4s)]
*  Island that benefits from our federal Medicaid spending, and 65 percent of her residents [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1148.52s)]
*  depend on Medicaid, and they would be unable to be residents of her facility without that support. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1155.64s)]
*  So sharing the real-life stories, thinking essential services at places like the Veterans [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1163.3200000000002s)]
*  Affairs Agency, like the people who work in our national security agencies, seeing them be [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1169.56s)]
*  terminated for no good reason, and having them here to demonstrate the real impact on services [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1177.08s)]
*  and on people's lives who serve this nation. REP. NICOLE GONZALEZ, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1184.4399999999998s)]
*  D-MA, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, Congressman, as you're on the Foreign Affairs [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1187.0s)]
*  Committee, and we've spoken to you a lot in the past about the war in Ukraine, I do want to ask you [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1188.52s)]
*  about that as well. We know that the president's team had hoped to perhaps announce a rare earth [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1193.24s)]
*  minerals deal with Ukraine perhaps tonight. We don't have any confirmation if that will happen, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1198.9199999999998s)]
*  but what would you like to see from the president when it comes to Ukraine in this speech? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1204.12s)]
*  REP. NICOLE GONZALEZ, D-MA, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, R-WILKINSON, Congressman, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1208.84s)]
*  I would like the president to be where the American people are, and that is [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1214.28s)]
*  standing with Ukraine, our ally in the cause of democracy, and to stand against Vladimir Putin. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1218.1999999999998s)]
*  We have a president who the Kremlin has said is in line with their vision. That is inconsistent [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1225.1599999999999s)]
*  with the American values that we put forward, that we are for democracy and not for dictators. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1234.04s)]
*  We are for the people who are fighting to protect our values and not those who are seeking to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1240.28s)]
*  disrupt our world order for chaos and problems throughout Europe. And so that is something that [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1246.76s)]
*  I hope the president's better angels speak to him on so that we can move forward and find [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1252.76s)]
*  a real lasting peace and a continued support of democracy. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1257.96s)]
*  Okay, Congressman, great to have you back on BBC News. Thank you so much. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1263.0s)]
*  Okay, time to bring in our panel for tonight. They've been waiting patiently, so I'll start [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1268.44s)]
*  here with Stephanie Murphy, former Democrat. Margaret Taleb is right next to me, senior [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1272.36s)]
*  contributor at Axios and director of the Syracuse University Institute for Democracy, Journalism, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1276.84s)]
*  and Citizenship. To my left here is Lance Trover, Republican strategist, and of course, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1282.6s)]
*  Rodney Davis, former Republican congressman from the state of Illinois. Welcome to all of you. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1289.88s)]
*  Of course, we're all sitting here waiting as we're looking at these live pictures. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1295.4s)]
*  Stephanie, I'll start with you because you're also familiar with this experience, having sat [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1299.8000000000002s)]
*  through state of the union addresses and addresses to Congress. What are you expecting to see tonight? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1303.72s)]
*  Well, I expect the president to have some talk about his record in the four [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1309.5600000000002s)]
*  very intense weeks that he's been in office, as well as some recrimination and some [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1317.32s)]
*  red meat for his base. I expect all of the members in the chamber to be very aware of the cameras, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1328.12s)]
*  and whether they stand and clap or if they don't stand and clap, it's a whole performance thing. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1337.0s)]
*  I also think there might be a little surprise because, after all, the president is a bit of a [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1342.76s)]
*  theatrical person. The last time that he was in front of the chamber doing a state of the union, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1351.0s)]
*  he presented a medal of freedom or a medal of honor to Rush Limbaugh. We should brace ourselves [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1356.92s)]
*  for some sort of theatrical thing, but it's going to be rambling. It'll feel a little bit like a [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1364.28s)]
*  campaign speech, and it will be rallying a Washington that's fully controlled by Republicans, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1373.0s)]
*  but they'll remember that tomorrow and the days after that they do fully control Washington. So [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1381.8s)]
*  all of the things that are happening will also be their responsibility, as well as their pride and [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1387.3200000000002s)]
*  joy. Rodney, as someone who's also sat through this moment, what are you looking out for tonight? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1392.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, I hope there's some theatrics, and I certainly hope that President Trump addresses [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1396.8400000000001s)]
*  the tariffs that were implemented against Canada and Mexico. I certainly think that many small [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1403.08s)]
*  businesses that I traveled to Capitol Hill with today, I hope the message that they've sent on [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1408.52s)]
*  Capitol Hill is getting through to the administration. They're concerned about the cost of groceries. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1415.1599999999999s)]
*  They're concerned about inflation. They're concerned about the economy. Again, the number [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1421.7199999999998s)]
*  one issue that sent President Trump and Vice President Vance to the White House. So I certainly [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1425.08s)]
*  hope that Howard Lutnick, who made comments today, is correct in stating that he hopes that there [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1430.68s)]
*  might be some relief to the tariffs that were announced today. But I will tell you, I don't [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1436.76s)]
*  know if Steph agrees with me. I'm just glad I'm not there. It's not because I don't want to listen [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1441.0800000000002s)]
*  to President Trump. I enjoyed his State of the Union speeches. They were very entertaining. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1445.96s)]
*  But first term, it's great. It's an experience. Second term, you're helping the freshmen out, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1451.4s)]
*  let them know what the experience is. Third term, you're just hoping like we did in the fourth term, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1457.4s)]
*  maybe you can't go because of COVID and you got a way out. It's all the standing and sitting. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1463.48s)]
*  Oh, and right now, as the House members are sitting there because they're told to get there [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1468.2800000000002s)]
*  soon, sooner than the Senate, and they're looking at all these empty seats going, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1474.0400000000002s)]
*  why did we give them up to the Senate? How come those little pieces of paper are on the back? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1478.3600000000001s)]
*  Why can't we sit there? Those are the things that people on the floor are talking about right now. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1482.3600000000001s)]
*  The shininess of it all wears off, I'm sure, after a few years of doing it. But Lance, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1487.24s)]
*  what are you looking out for from the president tonight? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1491.8s)]
*  I see the White House is billing it as must-see TV going off of what Stephanie said. There's no [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1494.2s)]
*  telling what it is. And then he said, tell it like it is. This is a guy who loves speaking directly [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1498.44s)]
*  to the American people. It's one of the things the American people like about him is that Donald [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1503.56s)]
*  Trump speaks frankly. He speaks like they speak. He says things that they're already thinking. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1507.56s)]
*  I would expect a lot of that tonight. He's got a lot of good things to talk about. Axios reported [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1513.0s)]
*  earlier today that illegal border crossings are down at a 25-year low. That is a huge win for him [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1517.3200000000002s)]
*  in the first several weeks of his administration. I also expect him to really talk about the economy [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1523.4s)]
*  and cost of living. I think it's something that he needs to address, and I think he will address it. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1528.8400000000001s)]
*  I expect him also to address the Ukraine issue. I think it's something that a lot of [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1533.0s)]
*  voters are going to be tuning into to see and just hear what his position is on it and where [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1537.16s)]
*  he sees this going. I think it is a very big issue for a lot of people. I think he will [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1542.36s)]
*  address that. And I think you're going to hear the term common sense. I've seen that a lot in [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1546.04s)]
*  reporting today and just a common sense agenda for the public. And so that's kind of the broad [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1549.32s)]
*  everybody. It's a very frank discussion. I think he'll have direct with the people. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1553.56s)]
*  What do you think, Margaret? Well, I certainly think the president sees himself and like other [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1556.6799999999998s)]
*  people to see him as a dealmaker, as a peacemaker. We keep hearing about this as Trump supporters [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1561.6399999999999s)]
*  championing the idea that this would be a good time for Donald Trump to win the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1568.52s)]
*  So I think you will hear him talk about is sort of whatever he wants to position as a victory lap [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1573.8799999999999s)]
*  for the first month in office in terms of deals and moves towards peace and in terms of [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1580.84s)]
*  accomplishments. I don't think that you're going to hear sort of a lot of self-introspection like [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1586.84s)]
*  should I have done what I did in the White House last Friday? Not probably not going to happen [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1594.76s)]
*  during this conversation, nor would it with any president. They're going to use a state of the [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1599.4s)]
*  union or a joint address to Congress, as this is called, is a chance to signal what you think is [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1603.4s)]
*  working for you, what you think you are empowered to do, what you believe voters mandate is, and to [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1609.96s)]
*  kind of, as Rodney suggested, try out or maybe Lance, try out some of the expressions and sayings [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1615.64s)]
*  that you're going to then be hearing on the road and in speeches in the weeks and months to come. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1621.8s)]
*  I think when it comes to the economy and when it comes to the price of goods, we're starting to see [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1626.9199999999998s)]
*  early numbers in national polling. Pew has some new numbers out showing only about a quarter of [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1631.24s)]
*  Americans think the economy is going in the right direction. There's a partisan split to be sure, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1635.8799999999999s)]
*  but there are many Republicans who don't feel great about where the economy is right now. So I [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1640.28s)]
*  think if there is an area where he will feel that he does need to explain, it will probably be in [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1644.76s)]
*  that area. All right. Well, certainly something we'll all be looking out for. And of course, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1651.48s)]
*  those made for TV moments, perhaps some of those viral moments as well, which might get clipped up. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1655.32s)]
*  But obviously this is a speech that's going to be watched across the U.S., of course, by the members [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1660.04s)]
*  of Congress who are there on hand and across the world. A lot of people looking to see what the [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1665.48s)]
*  president is going to say tonight. Let's bring in our next guest, Carla Sands, former U.S. ambassador [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1670.3600000000001s)]
*  to Denmark and to the first Trump administration and now a vice chair of the Center for Energy and [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1674.92s)]
*  Environment at AFPI. Ambassador, really good to have you with us tonight. First of all, I just [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1680.68s)]
*  want to get your take as we've been talking about what exactly to expect. A lot of people across [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1687.0800000000002s)]
*  the world, as we said, watching this, what do you think that they will hear from the president tonight? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1692.28s)]
*  They're going to hear about the great American renewal. That's the theme of his speech. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1698.76s)]
*  He's going to be talking about the things he's already gotten done in the first hundred days [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1703.24s)]
*  and then unfold his plan to make America great again. I just hope, I mean, I watch our great [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1708.12s)]
*  cousins, I'll call you all, across the pond in Great Britain, the U.K. as well. If your leadership, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1714.36s)]
*  government, would work with President Trump and close your borders and end DEI and actually [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1724.1999999999998s)]
*  celebrate your great and noble culture and stop the net zero nonsense and actually have [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1730.28s)]
*  cheap and abundant energy in the U.K., the U.K. can be great again, too. So I really hope that [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1737.6399999999999s)]
*  the media, no offense to you, but just the media writ large will stop brainwashing the people of [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1744.76s)]
*  the U.K. and that Great Britain, the U.K. can once again be great again. Well, we've seen, of course, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1750.6s)]
*  the very good relationship that Sir Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, has had with President [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1757.4s)]
*  Trump in the meeting that they had at the White House and their discussions on the war in Ukraine. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1763.48s)]
*  But you were the ambassador to Denmark, very concerned about some of the policies that this [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1767.88s)]
*  administration and this president have taken towards allies, of course, the tariffs on Mexico [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1773.4s)]
*  and Canada, and of course, Donald Trump's insistence on buying Greenland, which of course is, as we've [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1779.16s)]
*  heard from Denmark, is not for sale. What's your message to those allies? Well, so there's a lot [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1785.48s)]
*  to unpack with what you just said, but just to quickly try to answer everything. Greenland [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1791.96s)]
*  has stated that they're going independent. They're no longer going to be part of Denmark. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1797.88s)]
*  It's going to happen much quicker than I thought it would. I thought it was decades away. It's not. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1802.0400000000002s)]
*  So if they're leaving Denmark, who's going to secure Greenland just off our U.S. northeast coast? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1806.76s)]
*  That's not certain yet that they're going to be independent. Sorry? That's not certain yet [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1812.84s)]
*  that they're going to be independent, but sure, there is a movement, of course, for Greenland. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1816.84s)]
*  Well, it's been happening for decades, but suddenly it's happening very quickly. They will go [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1820.84s)]
*  independent. There's no slavery allowed. Denmark can't make them stay because they want it very [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1825.6399999999999s)]
*  badly. These are people that want to be independent of a former colonial power. Great Britain certainly [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1831.72s)]
*  understands that because you've seen those same stories and experiences. So they're going [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1837.96s)]
*  independent. We're not going to let them fall to Russia or China, and they're very vulnerable. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1844.6000000000001s)]
*  They don't have a military. They can't defend themselves. They can't develop themselves. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1849.16s)]
*  And so it will fall upon a reliable ally, and I believe the U.S. is the best country to do that. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1853.64s)]
*  I said we're not going to let them go into bad hands, and it could happen, but we're not going [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1861.24s)]
*  to let it happen because of President Trump's strong leadership. But regarding the Ukraine war, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1866.28s)]
*  let's not forget this would never have happened with a strong president in the White House. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1872.28s)]
*  Putin never invaded anyone under President Trump, but Joe Biden never even picked up the phone and [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1876.44s)]
*  talked about it. Vladimir Putin in three and a half years, there was no attempt to end this war. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1882.44s)]
*  Instead, billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars of American taxpayer funds [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1899.0800000000002s)]
*  were shoveled to Ukraine, one of the most corrupt countries in the world. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1904.2s)]
*  Ambassador, can I jump in there? What would you like to see? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1908.52s)]
*  What demands would you like to see President Trump make of Vladimir Putin then? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1912.04s)]
*  He wants to end the war. President Trump wants to end the war. It's not going to be pretty. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1916.68s)]
*  There's no question. Nobody's going to be happy with the outcome. But the fact is the killing [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1921.24s)]
*  should stop. The treasure is our young, whether it's the U.K., America, Russia, or Ukraine. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1925.8s)]
*  Our young men and women are our country's treasure. And for instance, the fentanyl deaths that have [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1932.28s)]
*  been happening in the United States, fentanyl precursors coming from China, which so it's a [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1937.8s)]
*  chemical warfare on the U.S. from China via the cartels, often through Mexico. It's the number [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1942.84s)]
*  one killer of our young. The Russian war is the number one killer of the Ukraine young. Remember [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1949.96s)]
*  that the average soldier in Ukraine is now 45 years old. They're running out of men. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1955.32s)]
*  So if I could come back ambassador to that question about tariffs on Mexico and Canada, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1959.8799999999999s)]
*  do you think as we heard from a congressman a little bit earlier in our program that this is [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1963.72s)]
*  a bargaining tactic and that they will be lifted, these tariffs? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1968.52s)]
*  Well, let's think about the tariffs for a second. The United States has been the piggy bank for the [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1972.6000000000001s)]
*  rest of the world. We pay around net net about 370 billion to the rest of the world in tariffs. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1976.6000000000001s)]
*  They pay around 50 billion to us. Canada has over 100% tariffs on on our dairy, on some of our meat. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1982.68s)]
*  Well, that's not fair. We don't tear off other countries 100%. So we want reciprocal trade. In [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1991.08s)]
*  other words, lower your tariffs. So President Trump's using the tariffs. And I know the markets [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=1997.1599999999999s)]
*  don't like it. They don't like the uncertainty. But we'll get to a good place. We have to bring [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2001.72s)]
*  manufacturing back to the United States. We have to get tariffs on a reciprocal level playing field. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2006.4399999999998s)]
*  We cannot have these terrible trade deficits. And that's what we want. And it's because of bad trade [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2011.96s)]
*  deals, really with mostly the rest of the world. Ambassador, really good to speak to you tonight. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2018.28s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us on the UC news. And we're just looking at images there. We're [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2024.28s)]
*  expecting to see President Trump leaving the White House. As we said, he'll be heading over [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2029.16s)]
*  to the Capitol to deliver that address to this joint session of Congress. We're expecting that [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2033.8799999999999s)]
*  that to happen any moment. So we'll keep our eye there on the right hand part of your screen. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2038.92s)]
*  As we're waiting, let's talk a bit more about the foreign policy aspect of what we're expecting to [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2043.72s)]
*  hear tonight. Of course, we've been hearing from the ambassador just there about the war in Ukraine [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2048.68s)]
*  and the issues of tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico. Let's talk about this with Ravi Agarwal, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2053.64s)]
*  editor in chief of foreign policy. Ravi, great to see you and to have you with us tonight on BBC News. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2060.04s)]
*  You know, we don't necessarily think of foreign policy as a central pillar of this type of [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2067.0s)]
*  address. And just as we're as I'm going to ask a first question, I want to note that we're seeing [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2072.36s)]
*  Donald Trump leaving the White House there. He's about to get into his motorcade to head over to [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2077.88s)]
*  the Capitol. This is all part of the process. Of course, there we see him getting in the car. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2083.6400000000003s)]
*  Door has just been closed. He will take that short journey over to the Capitol from the White House. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2088.52s)]
*  And I think we just saw Elon Musk on our screens. We know, of course, that the world's richest man [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2095.4s)]
*  and close adviser to the president and one of the leaders of DOGE, the Department of Government [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2101.08s)]
*  Efficiency, that he will be on hand, that he has been really very close to the president since he [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2106.44s)]
*  took office on January 20th. In fact, we've seen Elon Musk in a number of press conferences [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2112.7599999999998s)]
*  standing side by side with the president taking part in the first cabinet meeting as well. And [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2118.12s)]
*  there you see Donald Trump as that motorcade is just leaving the White House to head over to the [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2123.96s)]
*  Capitol. We are expecting the president to arrive there within the hour, of course, and really at [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2130.36s)]
*  the top of the hour is around when we anticipate that his address to the joint session of Congress [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2136.52s)]
*  will begin and renewal of the American dream, as we just heard a little bit earlier. That is a theme [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2142.84s)]
*  that the Trump administration, that his press secretary has said, has been set for this evening. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2149.1600000000003s)]
*  But as we're watching these images, Ravi, I just want to come back to you because we were just [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2154.36s)]
*  talking with the former ambassador to Denmark about foreign policy and how allies see and are [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2159.16s)]
*  watching this address. Of course, they're watching this closely as well. How do you think they're [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2165.3999999999996s)]
*  anticipating what we're going to see tonight? Well, they'll be listening very closely and they will [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2169.8799999999997s)]
*  be watching and waiting to see if Trump has any bombshell announcements. There have been so many [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2175.3199999999997s)]
*  of the last 40 odd days and they'll be waiting to see if he has a deal to announce on the critical [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2181.16s)]
*  minerals with Ukraine, if he has any more threats to lobby at any number of American allies. Look, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2187.56s)]
*  this has been a tumultuous opening to Trump's presidency, especially for the rest of the world. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2194.7599999999998s)]
*  When you consider that American foreign policy in many ways, the bedrock of it was a system of [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2202.2s)]
*  alliances, a backing of a rules-based global order, and Trump has in many ways upended all of that, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2208.68s)]
*  making very clear that the America First model is about American interests and American interests [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2216.76s)]
*  alone and that the rules really don't apply if they don't work for a very narrowly defined [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2222.5200000000004s)]
*  definition of what American interests are. And we've seen that most of all in the implementation [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2231.0800000000004s)]
*  of tariffs as a foreign policy cudgel and, of course, the abandonment of traditional U.S. allies. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2236.6800000000003s)]
*  So very tumultuous and we can expect him to build on that today. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2242.68s)]
*  There we're looking at some live pictures of the Capitol. We just saw that motorcade leave [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2246.12s)]
*  the White House heading to the Capitol, so expecting the president to arrive there shortly. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2250.12s)]
*  Speaking of tariffs, you know, we heard the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2256.04s)]
*  very upset speaking very frankly. Of course, he's leaving office, so he was, of course, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2260.7599999999998s)]
*  unburdened, if you will, by maybe some of the previous diplomatic constraints that he might have [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2265.48s)]
*  faced, but he spoke very clearly to Donald Trump and said, quoting the Wall Street Journal, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2269.96s)]
*  this is a dumb move, but he also explicitly meant to weaken Canada's economy. Do we get a sense that [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2274.68s)]
*  there is anything to that or that this is a negotiating tactic? Well, I mean, at this point, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2281.64s)]
*  everything is a negotiating tactic and I think Trump has designed it as such by making maximalist [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2287.4s)]
*  threats, by, you know, saying that 30 days later we'll come back to this issue. So some of this is, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2293.2400000000002s)]
*  very much a reality TV presidency that we're living in where people like you and me are [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2300.04s)]
*  forced to follow along and see if things actually get enacted as they're said to be. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2305.16s)]
*  But where we are is serious enough. I mean, it is now about sort of 20-odd hours in [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2311.24s)]
*  to severe tariffs that have been imposed on Canada and Mexico to the tune of 25 percent. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2318.7599999999998s)]
*  Canada, of course, has tried to retaliate, you know, and in their minds, they genuinely don't [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2325.56s)]
*  understand why this needed to happen. No economist worth their salt will say that this adds up, that [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2330.6s)]
*  it makes sense that two countries that, you know, among the biggest trading partners in the world [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2337.8s)]
*  would try and impose tariffs on each other when the bedrock of their relationship has been free [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2343.2400000000002s)]
*  trade. Same with the United States and Mexico. It doesn't add up. This will cause an inflationary [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2348.04s)]
*  shock. And one of the big opening contradictions of Trump's foreign policy is that on the one hand, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2354.04s)]
*  he genuinely believes he's not doctrinaire about too many things, but he genuinely believes that [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2360.92s)]
*  tariffs work for the United States. And yet they are eventually inflationary. They do cause stock [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2366.2s)]
*  market turbulence. Those are two things he really dislikes. So things will come to a head there. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2372.6s)]
*  All right, Ravi, thank you very much for that analysis. We'll be coming back to you [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2379.08s)]
*  a little bit later in the evening. I just want to go back to the Capitol to Helena Humphrey, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2382.84s)]
*  our correspondent, who is there for us tracking all of the action. Helena, we mentioned that [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2387.96s)]
*  the motorcade is rolling on its way to the Capitol, so the president will arrive there shortly. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2393.0800000000004s)]
*  Give us a sense of what we know the president at this point will be touching on in his speech [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2398.44s)]
*  tonight. Sumi, about half an hour now to go to showtime, and I call it showtime because in the [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2404.1200000000003s)]
*  words of the White House press secretary, this will be must watch television, expecting an [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2411.32s)]
*  audience of about 40 million people to tune in. And in terms of what we expect him to say, of [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2417.2400000000002s)]
*  course, different groups, whether that is domestically or around the world, will be tuning in [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2422.6000000000004s)]
*  for different reasons. According to the White House, the main takeaway theme of this speech [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2426.92s)]
*  will be the revival of the American dream. The White House saying that it will be a four-parter [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2432.44s)]
*  speech touching on immigration and the economy among those top key campaign pledge issues. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2437.24s)]
*  And I think it's fair to say that when it comes to the U.S. domestic audience, that attention will [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2445.16s)]
*  be very much focused on the economy, plans to address cost of living issues, not least on a day, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2449.16s)]
*  of course, where those tariffs have come into force and also on a day where they have rattled [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2456.04s)]
*  markets as well. Internationally, I think the eyes of the world will be tuned very much on [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2461.64s)]
*  Ukraine when we seem to be seeing an upending of orthodoxy when it comes to foreign policy with [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2467.56s)]
*  regards to Russia, more of an openness, it seems, from the Trump administration towards Russia, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2473.32s)]
*  but also, of course, last night hearing from the administration that it is pausing all military aid [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2478.6s)]
*  to Ukraine. We really will be watching to see if there is an announcement of that minerals [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2484.6s)]
*  deal. Of course, that had been left on the table with President Zelensky hastily departing the [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2490.7599999999998s)]
*  White House following that spat that he had in the Oval Office with Donald Trump, with JD Vance, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2496.04s)]
*  the vice president. So those are some of the key issues I think people will be watching for, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2501.96s)]
*  but also watching for the mood in the room of the Democratic lawmakers, what they will be bringing [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2506.6s)]
*  to the table in that rebuttal as well. I think we probably can expect the Democrats to try and put [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2511.48s)]
*  some more flesh on the bone when it comes to that counter vision for the economy when people are [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2516.76s)]
*  still saying that inflation is playing its part when they are still feeling a high cost of living, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2521.48s)]
*  and also some reports that some Democratic lawmakers are expected to bring into the chamber [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2528.6000000000004s)]
*  egg cartons or egg boxes to reinforce that point with regards to increasing prices. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2532.76s)]
*  And as you've been speaking, Helena, we're watching the senators arriving to take their [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2538.84s)]
*  seats, as you said, less than 30 minutes now until the speech is set to start when we saw [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2542.68s)]
*  the vice president JD Vance arriving. And we're going to come back to you a little bit later in [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2546.7599999999998s)]
*  the evening, Helena, but we're watching these pictures, John Ossoff, the Democrat senator there. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2552.8399999999997s)]
*  Of course, as Helena said, Democrats will be looking closely to see what they can rebut this [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2557.96s)]
*  evening. Alyssa Slotkin, the freshman senator from the state of Michigan, will be officially [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2564.04s)]
*  delivering the rebuttal. But as I said, we might see some messaging from the other Democrats as [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2569.88s)]
*  well. So that is the procession that we've just seen pass by those senators. And as we mentioned, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2573.96s)]
*  we've seen the motorcade already leave the White House and we saw Donald Trump and as we understand, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2581.1600000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk as well in the motorcade. So they should be arriving shortly. You see them all lined up, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2586.84s)]
*  getting ready to go into the chamber. I want to bring the panel back in. Stephanie, what's this [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2593.08s)]
*  moment like as you're waiting for the speech to start? It's kind of long and boring, but you do a [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2598.92s)]
*  lot of mingling with your colleagues and saying hello. And then there are people who notoriously, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2605.2400000000002s)]
*  every year, they kind of elbow their way to be on that aisle so that they can shake the president's [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2611.8s)]
*  hand while he walks down there. So there's a lot of seeing the vice president JD Vance and of course, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2618.6s)]
*  the Senate Majority Leader, John Thune as well. They're shaking hands as you're saying, Stephanie. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2623.64s)]
*  And so I mean, I think people have to really brace themselves for this and practice their resting, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2628.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, non-expressionless days. Sure. You know, and then when the speech goes on, it's like, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2635.96s)]
*  when do you stand up and clap? When do you not stand up and clap? Because you know that the cameras [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2643.56s)]
*  are on you at all times. They're on you. Of course, they're going to be on Chuck Schumer, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2648.3599999999997s)]
*  the Senate Minority Leader and Amy Klobuchar behind him there. We just saw Marjorie Taylor Green, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2651.64s)]
*  you can see just on the left of your screen. She's always on the aisle. Rodney, what are you [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2655.88s)]
*  looking out for here? You know, I'm just looking out for any conversations that are going to be [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2662.28s)]
*  extra entertaining right now. Are you seeing any of them? Not yet. Not yet. You know, maybe an [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2668.44s)]
*  interaction with Senator Durbin and Representative Green would be interesting. But you know, most of [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2674.6s)]
*  the time you just don't see that. It's actually a pretty jovial event where it's bipartisan, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2681.32s)]
*  where you can joke around with those on the other side. I will tell you one person that I miss seeing [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2687.0800000000004s)]
*  there is our former colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee. Sheila and I got along great. And to see [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2693.0s)]
*  she's not there at her normal seat on the aisle, regardless of who the president is, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2701.2400000000002s)]
*  is bittersweet. But watching this happen brings back old memories of being able to just sit back [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2706.1200000000003s)]
*  and talk to my colleagues, find out what they think the speech is going to be about. And really, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2713.88s)]
*  you got two hours away from your staff and they really can't get a hold of you. It's really a [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2720.52s)]
*  peaceful opportunity. I didn't think about that. Stephanie, you were just pointing out something. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2724.92s)]
*  No, I was just saying there's Nancy Mace and J.P. Vance. Yep. Nancy Mace, of course, a close ally of [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2728.36s)]
*  President Trump and Senator Tom Cotton. What are you looking out for, Lance and also Margaret? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2734.92s)]
*  I think it's a big night for the president. I think he views this as an opportunity to speak [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2740.12s)]
*  directly to the American people. I think he really doesn't care about the audience that is [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2743.8s)]
*  in front of him. I think he cares about the 30 to 40 million people that are going to be watching. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2748.2000000000003s)]
*  He's hovering around a 50 percent approval rating right now. CNN had him at 48, but CBS the week [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2752.28s)]
*  before had him at 52. That's really good for Donald Trump's personal approval rating. And [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2757.16s)]
*  given everything that he's done, that shows you that the American public so far is giving him a [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2761.48s)]
*  lot of leeway. And so I think he's going to take that opportunity to take some victory laps on, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2766.28s)]
*  like I said, the immigration issue and some of the other things he's done in terms of cutting [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2770.2s)]
*  spending with government and also outline where he sees us going on the economy. But, Margaret, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2773.96s)]
*  don't you wonder what those conversations are that J.D. Vance is having with all these members? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2777.8s)]
*  Whatever that was, Nancy Mace, J.D. Vance conversation. What's interesting, as we're watching [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2781.4s)]
*  folks come in, politicians are never known for their great style, either a journalist, so [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2785.48s)]
*  a fair point. But except for you, Rhonda, you look great tonight. I was going to say, as you're [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2791.88s)]
*  watching folks come in, you'll also be watching for clothing to some extent, especially among the [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2796.44s)]
*  Democratic side, because there have been a lot of side conversations about do some women who are [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2803.8s)]
*  critical of Trump want to dress in pink? There have been years when especially Democratic women [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2809.88s)]
*  would dress in white, in like a suffragette white. A lot of members of the Congressional [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2814.68s)]
*  Black Caucus saying, this is a really somber time, everyone should wear black. And then, of course, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2819.16s)]
*  some combination of blue and yellow. And that would be a statement of support for Ukraine [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2823.64s)]
*  that you can see tonight. We've talked a lot about what Donald Trump, President Trump wants to get [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2829.08s)]
*  out of this and what message he's trying to broadcast. It's also true that the Democratic [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2834.2s)]
*  Party, the opposition, if you will, which is in the minority across government right now and has [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2838.44s)]
*  very little power except for maybe to slow down the wheels of budget continuing resolutions if [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2843.72s)]
*  they don't like the terms of it. But a lot of disagreement inside the Democratic Party among [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2850.52s)]
*  some of the more liberal districts or some of the younger, more activist members versus the [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2857.08s)]
*  Democratic establishment institution about whether to use this moment, their seats in the audience, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2866.3599999999997s)]
*  to protest in some way. I think eggs themselves have been ruled out, but do they bring in egg [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2873.3199999999997s)]
*  cartons? As we see the Vice President and the Speaker of the House on the dais, of course, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2878.9199999999996s)]
*  now that's where they'll be seated for the speech. But yes, absolutely. But are you going to see [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2883.64s)]
*  Democrats walk out en masse when there are certain lines in the speech that the President may use? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2889.08s)]
*  Do you think that's going to happen, Stephanie? No, I think that... And you see Elon Musk, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2893.9599999999996s)]
*  of course, as we said, sorry. Earlier today's, Hakeem Jeffries basically talked about the [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2898.36s)]
*  need to show up because nobody pushes you out of the House. This is the people's House, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2908.1200000000003s)]
*  and members of the Democratic and the Republican Party represent the people. And so Democrats [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2913.32s)]
*  should be there, whether they agree or disagree with what it is that is said. But I think you will [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2919.48s)]
*  see them trying to keep the messaging focused on what have you done for me lately, and focused on [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2924.36s)]
*  what he promised to do for the American people. He promised to lower costs. And to date, while his [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2933.56s)]
*  approval ratings are hovering right around 50-some percent, he has managed to increase [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2939.8s)]
*  joblessness. He has managed to increase the cost of goods. There's predictions that there's going [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2945.8s)]
*  to be negative growth. And those are things that I think the Democratic Party is going to hold his [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2954.2s)]
*  feet to the fire for. Look to see whether or not he addresses that in this speech. And if he doesn't, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2958.8399999999997s)]
*  continue to hammer on those issues. And we're seeing some of the images of those in the gallery, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2964.9199999999996s)]
*  and those are some of the guests who were invited. And Rodney, this is a critical part, isn't it, also [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2968.8399999999997s)]
*  of the President's speech, because he will look up to the gallery and point out certain people [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2973.3999999999996s)]
*  to highlight parts of his address. He certainly will. And that's why many in the box with the First [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2979.08s)]
*  Lady will be the ones that are pointed out. But don't underestimate that almost everybody in that [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2986.52s)]
*  gallery is there for a reason. Those members of Congress like Stephanie and me, I mean, you bring, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2992.52s)]
*  you have one ticket that you can give out to anybody you want in your district or anybody you [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=2998.28s)]
*  want in the country. And that one ticket gets them into this event. I mean, this is a very highly [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3003.8s)]
*  sought after event. And you bring somebody who's going to be able to be a messenger of what message [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3008.68s)]
*  you want taken back home. I brought a former MLB player, Jason Worth, one time because he was an [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3016.44s)]
*  organic farmer in my district. And I think the Democrats will be bringing veterans who have lost their jobs. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3021.96s)]
*  That's right. They said that. They're going to be bringing people who have suffered at the haphazard [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3028.12s)]
*  way. I mean, I think Americans all believe in efficiency and eliminating fraud, waste and abuse, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3034.2s)]
*  but they don't want to see it done in an incompetent way, in a haphazard way. And so I think you'll see a [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3040.9199999999996s)]
*  lot of Democrats identifying people who have key roles in government, who have been let go without [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3046.3599999999997s)]
*  cause, who may have been in charge of nuclear safeguards or are in charge of... [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3053.64s)]
*  Huckley-Jeffrey's there. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3061.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So I think you'll see a lot of that being highlighted by the Democrats. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3062.12s)]
*  I think the biggest problem for the Democrats is they're in the minority and the president commands [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3065.8s)]
*  the attention no matter what, but this is Donald Trump, the president. And so it's on a whole other [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3070.52s)]
*  level. And I think he's going to get every headline he wants. The Democrats are going to do the best [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3075.7200000000003s)]
*  job they can. They're going to have a response, but this is really Donald Trump's night. And that's [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3079.4s)]
*  what's going to come out of this. And Republican's night, to be fair. I mean, they control the House [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3084.6s)]
*  and the Senate. You know, it's interesting. We're going to, we'll hear after the president's [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3088.76s)]
*  address from Alyssa Slotkin, this Senator, a former Congresswoman from Michigan. It's important [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3094.0400000000004s)]
*  because Michigan is a battleground state. It's important because she won her race. It's also [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3099.5600000000004s)]
*  important because of her background. She has served in the CIA, the Defense Department and [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3103.4s)]
*  the State Department. And as we're talking about job cuts, there are many Americans who are fine [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3107.6400000000003s)]
*  with the job cuts, absolutely fine with them. And they tend to be supporters of the president and [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3114.0400000000004s)]
*  they want more. And they'd be, they're probably more excited about job cuts in Washington. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3118.44s)]
*  As we look at Elon Musk. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3123.08s)]
*  Yes, Mr. Doege. But even in their communities, there are many Americans who are like, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3124.2000000000003s)]
*  you know what? The government's too big. But veterans, and you mentioned veterans, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3130.84s)]
*  that is one of the sticking points. I think it was the New York Times. Someone has reported [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3135.0s)]
*  in the last couple of days that nearly a third of the civilian federal workforce are people who have [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3139.96s)]
*  been veterans in some capacity. It's an enormous number. In fact, check me if I'm off on that, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3147.56s)]
*  but it is, there are, of the people who are being displaced and the people who may be displaced [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3152.28s)]
*  in the weeks and months to come who do civil service jobs. Many of them have served in the [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3157.88s)]
*  U.S. military before. And this is a population that President Trump has sought to embrace and [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3162.52s)]
*  to say, I'm your guy. I care about veterans. But when they come home from war, many of them do go [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3167.8s)]
*  serve their government in civilian capacities and many of their jobs are on the line. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3173.72s)]
*  Ironically, because of DEI policies that give preference to veteran status. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3177.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, we just actually been looking, just a moment ago, we saw Senator Katie Britt, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3184.6s)]
*  and she actually delivered the rebuttal last year at the speech. So that was her opportunity to [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3188.7599999999998s)]
*  counter President Biden at the time. It's a message. And we saw Senator Lindsey Graham as well. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3194.8399999999997s)]
*  There you see Cash Patel, I believe that is that Chris LaSavita to his right, Donald Trump's [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3199.08s)]
*  campaign manager or co-campaign manager from the summer and there, Ivanka Trump. And you see the [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3204.52s)]
*  second lady, Usha Vance on hand as well. She's there up in the box. We're expecting her, of course, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3209.4s)]
*  to be watching alongside or just above Melania Trump, who will be there. And we mentioned [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3216.76s)]
*  Melania Trump will have a number of guests with her who will be significant. And we see the members [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3221.96s)]
*  of Donald Trump's family, Donald Trump Jr. there as well. We see Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3228.6s)]
*  I think we see Tiffany Trump, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, that is Tiffany Trump as well. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3234.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm watching from the screen from a little bit far away, but I see Eric Trump as well. So you see the [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3240.44s)]
*  family on hand, of course, for Donald Trump's first address to the joint session of Congress [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3245.7999999999997s)]
*  since his reelection. And we've seen, of course, now this moment. This is Rodney, one of those [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3251.96s)]
*  moments, I think, when you see the vice president, the speaker of the House killing time there on the [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3257.96s)]
*  days until the president arrives. You're not watching them until you sit down for the speech. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3262.84s)]
*  The perspective for a member of Congress is watching whomever is walking in next and waiting [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3270.12s)]
*  for the House Sergeant at Arms to come in and announce the president's going to be there. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3275.2400000000002s)]
*  Because at that point in time, you then know the speech begins and the clock begins. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3279.2400000000002s)]
*  One thing that Lance mentioned earlier, which is absolutely true, no matter what Democrats say or [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3283.56s)]
*  do, no matter who the guests are that they have, none of it matters for the approximately two hours [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3289.16s)]
*  that Donald Trump will have the world's attention when he's giving this speech. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3295.96s)]
*  This is going to be a two-hour speech. I didn't know it sign up for that. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3300.6s)]
*  Have you ever heard him breathe? I'm going to take the over. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3303.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I can say as we're looking at these pictures, I have some numbers in 2017, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3310.12s)]
*  Donald Trump spoke for an hour, 2018, 80 minutes, 2019, 82 minutes, 2020, 78 minutes. Maybe that [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3314.7599999999998s)]
*  gives us a bit of an idea of what to expect. All less than his inaugural speech. Not inaugural [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3322.2s)]
*  speech, but his convention speech. Just a few weeks into his term, of course, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3327.24s)]
*  what opportunity does this as we see the speaker? Let's listen in, actually, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3335.08s)]
*  because we've just seen him gaveling in this speech. Let's listen in. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3338.9199999999996s)]
*  The chair appoints his members of the committee on the part of the House to escort the president [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3345.4799999999996s)]

*  The members of the escort committee will exit the chamber through the lobby doors. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3439.8s)]
*  Right, what you've been watching there is the speaker and the vice president. They had both [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3447.08s)]
*  appointed members from the respective chambers as the escort committee for the president, so he has [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3450.84s)]
*  just called on them to leave the chamber, of course, to escort the president in. Lance, as we're [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3456.44s)]
*  looking at this and, you know, we're getting a bit of a picture just how packed this night is, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3463.64s)]
*  but a lot of anticipation to see what we're going to hear from President Trump. And we've gotten [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3467.64s)]
*  some excerpts. And, you know, just to say that from what we're hearing from the White House [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3472.6s)]
*  as an excerpt, he's going to say we're just getting started. America's momentum is back. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3477.3199999999997s)]
*  Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. Something, perhaps, we expected. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3483.48s)]
*  This is, I certainly don't recall an administration hitting the ground running the way these guys have, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3490.2s)]
*  whether it's via executive orders, they were passing legislation early. Doing what he's done [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3495.3199999999997s)]
*  has been at light speed. I expect that's, we're just, I agree with him. I think this just getting [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3500.7599999999998s)]
*  started for everybody in the media who's like, we can't handle all the news that's coming our way. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3506.12s)]
*  Buckle up. I don't think this is going to end anytime soon. I mean, he knows what he's, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3510.52s)]
*  and he's really getting on a clock before the next election. He knows that. So I think these [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3515.0s)]
*  next two years are going to be critically important to him in this administration. And I think we're [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3518.76s)]
*  going to see a lot more of what we've been seeing. Next election, you mean the midterm elections? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3523.1600000000003s)]
*  Correct. Just to clarify. Thank you for clarifying. Appreciate that. Yes. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3526.28s)]
*  Not that far away. Stephanie, what are you looking at as you're seeing, of course, these very familiar [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3530.1200000000003s)]
*  rituals that you've taken part in? You know, I mean, I think Democrats will probably be, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3535.7200000000003s)]
*  especially centrist will, and both on the Democratic and the Republican side, will have to [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3543.24s)]
*  determine when they stand up and clap, what are they going to be able to cheer the president on? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3549.08s)]
*  And they will be looking for places in which they can be supportive so that it doesn't look [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3555.4799999999996s)]
*  as if they are just against everything. But they are going to look for places where what he is [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3561.0s)]
*  proposing is reasonable and aligns with what their constituents want. And they're going to show [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3566.6s)]
*  support there. But also there's a tricky balance with the base, right? And I think that's true, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3571.48s)]
*  well, a little less true for the Republican side. But, you know, should a Republican not stand when [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3578.2s)]
*  their base believes that they should? What consequences exist for that? And so I think [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3585.08s)]
*  the place to sit in this chamber is underneath the arm of the camera so that it can't be pointed [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3591.64s)]
*  at you so that what your response is, is not watched fully. But I think we're just going to [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3598.6s)]
*  see the Supreme Court justices come in now. They come in and they have their seats kind of up in the front. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3605.96s)]
*  And I think that's also an interesting thing. I mean, you have all three branches of government, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3612.68s)]
*  although I think in the start of this administration, it's really testing the [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3618.12s)]
*  bounds of the executive branch. Chief Justice Roberts, of course, attending here, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3622.92s)]
*  Elena Kagan and we see Brett Kavanaugh there as well. I believe Amy Coney Barrett just behind him. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3627.16s)]
*  I think retired Justice Anthony Kennedy is also on hand. So there we see Supreme Court justices [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3633.8799999999997s)]
*  past and present taking their seats. As you said, Stephanie, all three branches of government [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3639.96s)]
*  represented. Important, isn't it, Rodney, for this evening, really, to witness the president lay out [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3644.8399999999997s)]
*  his agenda? It is. And as much as I complain about having to sit around for hours, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3651.24s)]
*  these speeches, they are an event that it's an experience to be a part of. And the world is [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3657.16s)]
*  witnessing this once again. And really, I think more because of the last week here in Washington, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3663.8799999999997s)]
*  D.C., more eyes are on what's happening in the House chamber. And to be able to see, to be able [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3669.3199999999997s)]
*  to show the American people that in spite of who you voted for, in spite of how you may feel about [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3675.64s)]
*  President Trump outdoing Joe Biden's 50 initial executive orders by maybe 22 [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3681.08s)]
*  since he's been in office, America's coming together tonight. They're coming together to [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3689.48s)]
*  hear our president, whether you agree or disagree. And one thing that you will see, you will see [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3693.72s)]
*  bipartisan standing ovations, regardless of your politics, on certain issues that unite America. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3698.36s)]
*  So what tone are you expecting from the president? A conciliatory one, or as we've heard from [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3704.04s)]
*  Stephanie's chuckling a bit, but what are you expecting to hear in terms of tone from the [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3708.7599999999998s)]
*  president? Are you serious with that question? I mean, listen, well, there's not a lot of unifying [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3712.84s)]
*  message. Well, Donald Trump's idea of unifying message is different than those who oppose [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3721.24s)]
*  Donald Trump. I would say that many Republicans are going to look at the comments that Donald [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3727.4s)]
*  Trump is going to make tonight on a wide variety of issues and they are going to be unified. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3734.12s)]
*  But it also means that the opposition is going to be unified. And that happens in any country, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3739.24s)]
*  including the United States of America. But when we talk about a conciliatory message, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3744.68s)]
*  it's in the eye of the beholder. But Donald Trump has never been known. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3749.64s)]
*  There will be moments for the vulnerable Republican members who understand that they have an election [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3756.8399999999997s)]
*  in two years and they are in a difficult place that they will sit there and be like, gosh, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3762.12s)]
*  I wish he didn't say that because I'm going to be asked about it tomorrow. And I'm going to have to [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3766.52s)]
*  take a position on whatever it was. He said, are you okay with your farmers paying more or your [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3770.68s)]
*  farmers losing assets to markets or the market crashing and your retirees losing their stable [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3777.0s)]
*  income or social security being disrupted? Those are things that these vulnerable Republican [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3785.08s)]
*  members are going to have to respond to. And there will be moments where they're like, gosh, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3791.0s)]
*  I really wish he hadn't said that. And just as we're looking, I just want to mention these pictures. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3795.16s)]
*  Did you see a number of women wearing pink here? Something that we discussed a little bit earlier, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3799.96s)]
*  but we are waiting now just moments away as we see the chamber packed here. For any of us, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3804.6s)]
*  any of our viewers joining us just now, what you're seeing is live images of the chamber [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3812.36s)]
*  of a joint session of Congress where President Trump is due to deliver his address. Really just [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3817.3199999999997s)]
*  seconds from now, we're expecting the president to arrive and we see the vice president, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3823.3199999999997s)]
*  JD Vance and the speaker of the house on the days there. We have seen the Supreme Court justices, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3828.2s)]
*  a number of Supreme Court justices arrive and special guests of the first lady, of many of the [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3834.2s)]
*  members of Congress were there have all taken their seats a packed night. And this really is [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3840.12s)]
*  a critical moment. The speech comes at a point where we've seen several inflection points really [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3844.6s)]
*  for the president. When it comes to foreign policy on Ukraine, when it comes to economic policy on [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3850.12s)]
*  tariffs, when it comes to also his plan and his promise to get rid of government waste and what [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3856.04s)]
*  we've seen, the cuts that have been initiated by his department of government efficiency. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3863.0s)]
*  We've seen Elon Musk on hand as well. So all of this part of this very big evening. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3867.64s)]
*  Stephanie, I just cut you off there as we were looking at these images. Just wanted to remind [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3872.9199999999996s)]
*  our viewers we'll be probably getting into the speech very closely, very soon rather. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3877.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, just to say that there are going to be moments of unity and then moments of discomfort [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3882.12s)]
*  for both the left and the right. And the right is not immune from the moments of discomfort because [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3888.4399999999996s)]
*  they are going to have to answer for it, especially on things that he is doing that's going to hurt [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3895.16s)]
*  their constituents. And this is why the NRCC chair this morning gave guidance to the Republican [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3901.8s)]
*  members not to hold town halls anymore. So you don't like what you are hearing from your constituents, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3910.76s)]
*  stop listening to them is the guidance that's currently coming out of the Republican leadership. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3917.0800000000004s)]
*  And part of that is because their constituents are like, hey, what's going on with my Medicaid? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3922.04s)]
*  What's going on with social security? What you don't think? Part of it is also the left [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3928.68s)]
*  leaning group who is sending people into these. But these people are their constituents. They [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3933.3999999999996s)]
*  live in these districts. I mean, just as in during Obamacare, there were people who showed up [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3938.9199999999996s)]
*  at Democratic town halls and were they all those people's voices not needed to be listened to? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3945.3999999999996s)]
*  But there are groups that are organized, Politico reported it out today. But I guess the point is [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3952.04s)]
*  if you can't stand in front of the people you serve and hear what they say, then you must not [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3956.28s)]
*  have a good response. And it reads just the question, I guess, Lance, is what kind of economic [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3962.84s)]
*  message you think the president needs to deliver as we've seen in a poll from CBS, most people [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3967.2400000000002s)]
*  who will be watching tonight, voters want to see a message on inflation. He's absolutely going to [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3973.2400000000002s)]
*  address it. I think he will. I look at some of these issues he's been dealing with and I think [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3979.64s)]
*  the White House would tell you they look at these as holdover issues from the Biden [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3983.08s)]
*  administration that they've had to deal with the Ukraine war being one of them. Clearly the [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3986.7599999999998s)]
*  president. I just want to interrupt you for a moment to say the first lady, Melania Trump, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3990.52s)]
*  is arriving here to the executive box there. We see executive gallery, excuse me. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=3995.24s)]
*  There you see the first lady. Let's listen to the applause for a moment. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4000.04s)]
*  A warm and hearty applause there as you see for the first lady who will be taking her seat there [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4003.16s)]
*  in the executive gallery. And as we mentioned, the first lady will have a number of guests with her. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4015.3199999999997s)]
*  She is invited to take part and to witness this moment as well. Some of the guests who we can [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4021.16s)]
*  mention are families, family members of those who have been victims of violence at the hands of [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4027.56s)]
*  undocumented migrants. So we can expect that to be a part of the speech. They will be guests of [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4035.24s)]
*  the first lady in that box there where she's seated. We also know that there will be guests [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4040.92s)]
*  with her, Peyton McNabb, we understand, is a former high school athlete who suffered an injury [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4047.4s)]
*  in a volleyball game when somebody who was playing on a women's team, a biological man, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4054.7599999999998s)]
*  spiked a volleyball or head. So that gives you a sense. And here now we see the cabinet. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4060.3599999999997s)]
*  The secretary of state, Marco Rubio is there. Rodney, as we're looking at this, take us through [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4065.64s)]
*  what this specific moment as we're seeing this cabinet walk in is like. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4072.2s)]
*  Well, the truth is we're like, oh, okay, it's almost ready to start. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4077.08s)]
*  Exactly. Well, as you see, you know. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4080.52s)]
*  They're coming in, but it's no different than watching the Senate come in. No different than [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4082.2s)]
*  a little different than watching the Supreme Court justices come in because people don't really go [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4086.04s)]
*  after them to shake their hands. But you look at many of my former colleagues, folks like Marco [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4090.2s)]
*  Rubio, Doug Collins, Mike Waltz and many others that were former house members. They're going [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4095.3999999999996s)]
*  to get a raucous welcome. Sean Duffy right there. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. They're going to get a [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4102.5199999999995s)]
*  welcome reception from colleagues who are going to harass them on an individual basis. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4108.44s)]
*  That's what they're talking. That's what Tim Burch is talking about right now to the secretary [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4113.4s)]
*  of health and human services, RFK. And if I know Tim, it's a very witty comment right now. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4118.839999999999s)]
*  And Pete Hegs at the defense secretary there. I should say that Doug Collins is actually the [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4125.32s)]
*  designated survivor. He is the U S secretary of veterans affairs. So God help us. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4129.24s)]
*  So Doug Collins of all people. Doug is the best. He's a great guy. I hope he's watching. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4133.639999999999s)]
*  We'll let him know. We'll let him know you said that he is, as you said, a former colleague of [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4140.12s)]
*  yours. We just see Senator Dick Durbin seated there as we see Pete Hegs that going by. Pete Hegs, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4143.879999999999s)]
*  of course, playing a big role in some of those foreign policy discussions, Homeland Security as [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4148.759999999999s)]
*  well, as we see the entire cabinet come in. And, you know, we should say these cabinet nominations [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4153.4s)]
*  and the hearings actually went a lot smoother for the president and his team than some of us [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4160.28s)]
*  had anticipated that they would. And the EPA's Lee Zeldin there as well we see coming in. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4166.28s)]
*  They went smoother, Lawrence, than we had thought. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4171.5599999999995s)]
*  Look, we have a president who has an approval rate of like 95 percent of his party and Republicans [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4175.16s)]
*  control the Senate. You know, there were a few senators that voted no. But to me, always from [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4181.08s)]
*  day one, there was no way any of these people weren't going to pass. The Republicans are just [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4187.48s)]
*  behind him, lock, stock and barrel. He was always going to get the cabinet that he wanted because, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4191.4s)]
*  look, especially if you're up for reelection and you're going to go against the president and who [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4194.839999999999s)]
*  he wants, you know, this is a White House that doesn't take too kindly to those types of votes. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4199.5599999999995s)]
*  So to me, it was always going to happen. And he has two more votes in the Senate compared to [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4204.28s)]
*  when he was president eight years ago. It's amazing that there's a wider margin in the Senate than [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4209.879999999999s)]
*  there is in the House. That majority makes a huge difference. And didn't have to get time [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4214.6s)]
*  with the filibuster on these sort of nominations. You know, Lance mentioned former President Biden, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4217.72s)]
*  and I think you are certainly going to hear President Trump try to blame former President Biden [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4223.400000000001s)]
*  for some of the unpleasantnesses that he's dealing with. There'll be a lot of fact checking done [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4230.200000000001s)]
*  tonight as there should be on any president. We know that bird flu is driving in large part the [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4235.96s)]
*  cost of the price of eggs. But I will say that when you're a new president, you get to blame the [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4243.24s)]
*  last guy for the stuff that you wish you didn't have to deal with. There's an expiration date. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4249.08s)]
*  It's actually about as much time as it takes for eggs to go bad. There's an expiration date on how [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4254.44s)]
*  long you get to do that. And he gets to do that in this speech. Some people will believe him, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4259.96s)]
*  other people won't. Largely depends on where you get your news and how much information you're [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4266.36s)]
*  taking in to process whether it's really Joe Biden's fault that eggs are expensive. But there [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4270.6s)]
*  comes a time in every presidency, and President Biden found it to be true himself, where people [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4275.72s)]
*  don't want to hear that anymore because you're the person in charge. This is sort of a honeymoon [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4281.4800000000005s)]
*  phase. President Trump is choosing to use that honeymoon phase to do a bunch of stuff really fast [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4286.68s)]
*  before anyone can say no. And soon we'll find out whether that's what a majority of Americans [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4294.52s)]
*  want and are comfortable with. But everything from actions on the border, which are largely popular, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4301.8s)]
*  to the federal government cuts, to USAID, to his policy on Ukraine, to his social policies, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4310.120000000001s)]
*  to his appointments, to talk about deficits and what's driving debt, the tax cuts, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4316.84s)]
*  the first time around, are a huge driver long term because they reduce the amount of revenue [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4321.8s)]
*  coming in. He's going to try to do that a second time. There's a possibility the government will [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4326.92s)]
*  shut down if they can't find a patch. All of this is going to come to a boil after tonight's speech. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4330.92s)]
*  Tonight's speech is a chance for him to try to set expectations around all of these things as maybe [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4339.88s)]
*  things that seem tough but that need to happen and things that Americans should want. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4348.52s)]
*  Whether Americans agree with that assessment six months from now, we'll see. But this is his [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4352.76s)]
*  chance to use his communication skills to get his base solidified and to tell the people in between [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4357.8s)]
*  who are like, I don't know, I was really voted for him for inflation, to tell those people this is [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4364.360000000001s)]
*  all going to work out. Stick with me for a while. You asked about the inflation. I think you hit the [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4370.280000000001s)]
*  nail on the head. He's going to address it. I think the public is giving him some space. The [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4375.08s)]
*  public understands inflation is not going to come down tomorrow. But I think as long as he addresses [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4379.64s)]
*  it and talks about that we have a plan and we're working on it, I think that's a good point for him [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4384.04s)]
*  and that's why he will definitely hit it tonight because he knows the public wants to hear about [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4389.0s)]
*  that. He will absolutely talk. And I can see in these excerpts that the words common sense, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4393.0s)]
*  as I think was said here on the panel, are going to, yeah, as you said, Lance, you called that. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4397.8s)]
*  We're going to hear that. And I already do see in some of these excerpts we've received in advance [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4402.280000000001s)]
*  from the White House that President Biden's name, of course, is mentioned a few times as well. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4407.0s)]
*  See you, the real experts here. Just to give our viewers idea, we really are arriving. We've [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4412.52s)]
*  already seen the cabinet arrive. We've seen the Supreme Court justices arrive. They have been [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4416.4400000000005s)]
*  seated and of course the first lady in the executive gallery with her guests. So this buzzing, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4421.320000000001s)]
*  this action that you're seeing right now are just the moments before the president is escorted [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4426.44s)]
*  into the chambers and he will take his place. That, Rodney, that's a process as well as he [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4431.879999999999s)]
*  walks down the aisle and shakes every hand that is outstressed to him. It certainly is. And you're [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4437.32s)]
*  going to see, you're going to see a bipartisan push to be able to shake the president's hand. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4443.799999999999s)]
*  You see Marcy Capter from Ohio in a district that Trump won. It's not a coincidence she's sitting [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4449.24s)]
*  on the aisle once again. She is a Democrat. She's going to reach out and hopefully shake his hand. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4455.16s)]
*  And I can tell you from personal experience, as soon as you are shown shaking the president's hand, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4461.16s)]
*  you are noticed. I was shaking President Obama's hand after his State of the Union in 2013, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4467.16s)]
*  my first term, and my phone just immediately started. I knew exactly what the world was [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4473.72s)]
*  watching. What's that? What are people writing you? Just the writing. I just saw you with the [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4479.88s)]
*  president. I just saw you with the president. And you know what the president and I were talking about? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4483.88s)]
*  The fact that we had met each other in Springfield, Illinois when he was a state senator. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4487.24s)]
*  And we were talking about people that we knew mutually in my hometown of Taylorville, Illinois. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4491.24s)]
*  We didn't talk about your hometown of Viana. I'm glad you got it. If you were going to do Taylorville, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4496.2s)]
*  we had to do Viana. Had to do Viana. Lance and I are the representatives from central and southern [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4499.88s)]
*  Illinois to the BBC right now. Yeah, it's pretty unusual to have such a strong Illinois representation [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4505.400000000001s)]
*  on the BBC here today. But you know, we'll take it. But, Margaret, you know, looking at this, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4510.44s)]
*  you have to say that the president is coming to all of this in a position of strength, you know, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4515.08s)]
*  with his, of course, the Republicans in control of the Senate and the House, with his decisive victory. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4519.5599999999995s)]
*  And he promised action. And boy, have we seen action these first weeks of his term. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4525.799999999999s)]
*  As much as any one president can control the levers of government. And I think the Supreme Court [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4531.4s)]
*  would reserve judgment on that and say, hey, nobody controls us just because of who nominated [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4536.2s)]
*  us. But as much as someone can be positionally in control, like sort of on a chessboard, he's got [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4541.72s)]
*  a lot of levers at working in his direction. As Lance noted earlier, the minute we get into [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4548.679999999999s)]
*  midterm season, that could change if the Democratic Party gets its strategic act together and figures [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4558.679999999999s)]
*  who it wants to, what messages it wants to consolidate around, who its leaders are. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4565.08s)]
*  But I think for now, this is President Trump's moment to dominate. And he's taking advantage [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4569.16s)]
*  of every single bit of it. Again, when you look at the national polling, there are some warning [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4575.4s)]
*  signs on the horizon for him. He starts with not just a very divided public, but now underwater [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4579.72s)]
*  from a disapproval versus approval rating. And he's this early in a presidency to have [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4585.88s)]
*  such a high disapproval rating could be really problematic for him. But he has some running [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4594.12s)]
*  room, nevertheless. It looks like they're all about to take their seats. We just saw [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4602.28s)]
*  Pam Bondi, the attorney general. Let's listen in now. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4605.88s)]

*  Members of the United States Congress, thank you very much. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4976.08s)]
*  And to my fellow citizens, America is back. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4984.88s)]
*  Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=4995.08s)]
*  Golden Age of America. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5022.48s)]
*  From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5026.04s)]
*  greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5032.16s)]
*  We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5038.12s)]
*  years or eight years. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5043.959999999999s)]
*  And we are just getting started. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5046.32s)]
*  I return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5067.599999999999s)]

*  Our pride is back. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5075.2s)]
*  Our confidence is back. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5076.72s)]
*  And the American dream is surging bigger and better than ever before. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5078.76s)]
*  The American dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback, the [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5089.92s)]

*  The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5108.0s)]
*  decades. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5115.32s)]

*  A 47-point swing, the most ever. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5200.28s)]
*  Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5215.28s)]
*  A 41-point jump. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5224.28s)]

*  Thank you. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5338.48s)]
*  Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 executive orders and taken more than [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5340.48s)]
*  400 executive actions a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism, and wealth [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5346.48s)]
*  all across our wonderful land. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5353.48s)]
*  The people elected me to do the job, and I'm doing it. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5356.48s)]
*  In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency — it's [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5369.48s)]
*  our presidency — is the most successful in the history of our nation. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5386.48s)]
*  By many. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5393.48s)]
*  And what makes it even more impressive is that — do you know who number two is? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5399.48s)]
*  George Washington. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5411.48s)]
*  How about that? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5412.48s)]
*  How about that? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5413.48s)]
*  I don't know about that list, but we'll take it. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5414.48s)]
*  Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5418.48s)]
*  border, and I deployed the U.S. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5424.48s)]
*  Military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5426.48s)]
*  And what a job they've done. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5432.48s)]
*  As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5434.48s)]
*  Ever. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5442.48s)]
*  They heard my words, and they chose not to come. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5454.48s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5461.48s)]
*  In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5463.48s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5470.48s)]
*  And virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and people from [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5474.48s)]
*  mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5479.48s)]
*  Who would want to do that? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5486.48s)]
*  This is my fifth such speech to Congress. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5488.48s)]
*  And once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5491.48s)]
*  nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5497.48s)]
*  Nothing I can do. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5503.48s)]
*  I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5505.48s)]
*  nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5513.48s)]
*  to the lowest levels ever recorded. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5520.48s)]
*  And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5523.48s)]
*  cheer for these astronomical achievements. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5529.48s)]
*  They won't do it, no matter what. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5532.48s)]
*  Five times I've been up here. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5534.48s)]
*  It's very sad. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5537.48s)]
*  And it just shouldn't be this way. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5539.48s)]
*  So Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5541.48s)]
*  why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5563.48s)]
*  For the good of our nation, let's work together and let's truly make America great again. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5570.48s)]
*  Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5592.48s)]
*  a future that America deserves. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5599.48s)]
*  And we're doing it. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5602.48s)]
*  This is a time for big dreams and bold action. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5604.48s)]
*  Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5608.48s)]
*  all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5614.48s)]
*  I terminated the ridiculous Green New Scam. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5622.48s)]
*  I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5633.48s)]
*  dollars that other countries were not paying. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5640.48s)]
*  I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5644.48s)]
*  And I also withdrew from the anti-American UN Human Rights Council. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5653.48s)]
*  We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5664.48s)]
*  and totally unaffordable. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5670.48s)]
*  And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5673.48s)]
*  saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5680.48s)]
*  To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5685.48s)]
*  ten old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first day. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5703.48s)]
*  And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5715.48s)]
*  like no other president had done before. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5725.48s)]
*  We ordered all federal workers to return to the office. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5728.48s)]
*  They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5732.48s)]
*  And we have ended weaponized government, where as an example, a sitting president is allowed to [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5745.48s)]
*  viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5754.48s)]
*  How did that work out? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5759.48s)]
*  Not too good. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5762.48s)]
*  Not too good. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5764.48s)]
*  And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5776.48s)]
*  It's back. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5784.48s)]
*  And two days ago, I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5794.48s)]
*  I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5805.48s)]
*  And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley again. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5824.48s)]
*  Beautiful, Alaska. I love Alaska. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5836.48s)]
*  We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5840.48s)]
*  and indeed the private sector and our military. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5850.48s)]
*  And our country will be woke no longer. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5858.48s)]
*  We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer, or an air traffic controller, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5865.48s)]
*  you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5877.48s)]
*  Very important. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5884.48s)]
*  You should be hired. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5895.48s)]
*  Based on the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5897.48s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5903.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5905.48s)]
*  We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5907.48s)]
*  and I signed a new law that would allow us to have a more inclusive public school system. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5914.48s)]
*  I removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5922.48s)]
*  and I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5927.48s)]
*  that there are only two genders, male and female. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5933.48s)]
*  I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5937.48s)]
*  Three years ago, Peyton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5968.48s)]
*  preparing for a future in college sports. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5974.48s)]
*  But when her girls' volleyball match was invaded by a male, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5977.48s)]
*  he smashed the ball so hard in Peyton's face causing traumatic brain injury, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5981.48s)]
*  partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5988.48s)]
*  It was a shot like she's never seen before. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5994.48s)]
*  She's never seen anything like it. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=5998.48s)]
*  Peyton is here tonight in the gallery, and Peyton, from now on, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6000.48s)]
*  schools will kick the men off the girls' team or they will lose all federal funding. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6004.48s)]
*  And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6024.48s)]
*  weightlifting, track and field, swimming, or cycling, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6043.48s)]
*  where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6046.48s)]
*  for a new record by five hours. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6054.48s)]
*  Broke the record by five hours. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6057.48s)]
*  It's demeaning for women and it's very bad for our country. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6060.48s)]
*  We're not going to put up with it any longer. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6063.48s)]
*  What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6076.48s)]
*  that is now, because of us, sweeping the entire world. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6086.48s)]
*  Common sense has become a common theme and we will never go back. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6090.48s)]
*  Never. Never going to let that happen. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6096.48s)]
*  Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6102.48s)]
*  to working families. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6109.48s)]
*  As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6111.48s)]
*  and an inflation nightmare. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6117.48s)]
*  Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6121.48s)]
*  and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6126.48s)]
*  They've never had anything like it. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6131.48s)]
*  We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6133.48s)]
*  They're not sure. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6140.48s)]
*  As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6141.48s)]
*  Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6148.48s)]
*  The egg price is out of control. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6167.48s)]
*  And we're working hard to get it back down. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6171.48s)]
*  Secretary, do a good job on that. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6174.48s)]
*  You inherited a total mess from the previous administration. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6176.48s)]
*  Do a good job. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6180.48s)]
*  A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6189.48s)]
*  The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95 percent, [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6196.48s)]
*  slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6202.48s)]
*  We are opening up many of those power plants right now. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6209.48s)]
*  And frankly, we have never seen anything like it. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6222.48s)]
*  That's why on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6227.48s)]
*  As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth and by far. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6237.48s)]
*  And now I fully authorized the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6245.48s)]
*  It's called Drill Baby Drill. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6251.48s)]
*  My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6268.48s)]
*  among the largest in the world where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6274.48s)]
*  It's never been anything like that one. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6283.48s)]
*  It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6285.48s)]
*  The permitting is gotten. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6288.48s)]
*  And later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare Earth's here in the USA. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6290.48s)]
*  To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6304.48s)]
*  And to that end, I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6330.48s)]
*  Go. Perhaps you've heard of it. Perhaps. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6336.48s)]
*  Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6348.48s)]
*  Thank you, working very hard. He didn't need this. He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6370.48s)]
*  Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it. I believe they just don't want to admit that. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6377.48s)]
*  Just listen to some of the appalling waste. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6385.48s)]
*  We have already identified $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6389.48s)]

*  Under the Trump administration, all of these scams, and they're far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6560.48s)]
*  They're so bad. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6567.48s)]
*  Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6569.48s)]
*  Headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6577.48s)]
*  We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6580.48s)]
*  And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6590.48s)]
*  Taking back a lot of that money. We got it just in time. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6606.48s)]
*  This is just the beginning. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6609.48s)]
*  The government's Accountability Office, the federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6612.48s)]
*  And we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6622.48s)]
*  We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security Program for our seniors. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6626.48s)]
*  And that our seniors and people that we love rely on. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6635.48s)]
*  Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6639.48s)]
*  It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6654.48s)]
*  I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6663.48s)]
*  3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6669.48s)]
*  3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6678.48s)]
*  3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6686.48s)]
*  And money is being paid to many of them. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6694.48s)]
*  And we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck. Good luck. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6697.48s)]
*  You're going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people because it just keeps getting paid and paid and nobody does. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6704.48s)]
*  And it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6712.48s)]
*  1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6716.48s)]
*  We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6736.48s)]
*  Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6755.48s)]
*  One person between the age of 240 and 249. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6763.48s)]
*  And one person is listed at 360 years of age. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6768.48s)]
*  More than 100 years. More than 100 years older than our country. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6774.48s)]
*  But we're going to find out where that money's going. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6784.48s)]
*  And it's not going to be pretty. By slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft we can find. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6787.48s)]
*  We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6792.48s)]
*  And today interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It's about time. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6814.48s)]
*  And in the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6823.48s)]
*  Balance the federal budget. We're going to balance it. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6830.48s)]
*  With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling, which goes on sale very, very soon, for five million dollars. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6853.48s)]
*  We will allow the most successful job creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6862.48s)]
*  It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6870.48s)]
*  And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6875.48s)]
*  The money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that, but they have to pay tax, create jobs. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6881.48s)]
*  They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country instead of having them being forced out. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6886.48s)]
*  Number one, at the top school, as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6894.48s)]
*  So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6905.48s)]
*  the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6916.48s)]
*  we will now bring in brilliant hardworking job creating people. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6925.48s)]
*  They're going to pay a lot of money and we're going to reduce our debt with that money. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6930.48s)]
*  Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6945.48s)]
*  For nearly 100 years, the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits and held back America's potential in every possible way. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6951.48s)]
*  The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6964.48s)]
*  Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead take 10 years, 15 years and even 20 years before you're rejected. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6974.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6983.48s)]
*  My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy and we will restore true democracy to America again. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=6989.48s)]
*  And any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7004.48s)]
*  Because we are draining the swamp. It's very simple. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7019.48s)]
*  And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7024.48s)]
*  And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7034.48s)]
*  They're in there. They're waiting for you to vote. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7056.48s)]
*  And I'm sure that the people on my right, I don't mean the Republican right, but my right right here. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7059.48s)]
*  I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7066.48s)]
*  So I'm doing a big favor by telling you that. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7072.48s)]
*  But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7076.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7093.48s)]
*  The very, very big part of our plan. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7094.48s)]
*  We had tremendous success in our first term with it. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7096.48s)]
*  A very big part of our plan. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7099.48s)]
*  We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7100.48s)]
*  I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7110.48s)]
*  And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7130.48s)]
*  And by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen plants are opening up all over the place. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7156.48s)]
*  Deals are being made. Never seen. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7161.48s)]
*  That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7163.48s)]
*  It's a beautiful word, isn't it? [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7166.48s)]
*  That, along with our other policies, will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7169.48s)]
*  It's going to boom. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7176.48s)]
*  Spoke to the majors today, all three the top people, and they're so excited. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7177.48s)]
*  In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7182.48s)]
*  One of the largest anywhere in the world. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7193.48s)]
*  And this has taken place since our great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7208.48s)]
*  In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7223.48s)]
*  And just as we did before, we will provide 100 percent expensing. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7232.48s)]
*  It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7237.48s)]
*  And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7241.48s)]
*  First turn. We had a great first turn. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7253.48s)]
*  If you were under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7261.48s)]
*  Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7268.48s)]
*  And now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7271.48s)]
*  On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7276.48s)]
*  Have you heard of them? [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7283.48s)]
*  And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7285.48s)]
*  It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 percent. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7291.48s)]
*  China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7299.48s)]
*  And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7304.48s)]
*  Think of that four times higher. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7307.48s)]
*  And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7310.48s)]
*  But that's what happens. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7314.48s)]
*  This is happening by friend and foe. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7316.48s)]
*  This system is not fair to the United States and never was. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7319.48s)]
*  And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7322.48s)]
*  That's what that's not just one day was cost us a lot of money. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7332.48s)]
*  But we're going to do it in April. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7337.48s)]
*  I'm a very superstitious person. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7340.48s)]
*  April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7342.48s)]
*  And whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7346.48s)]
*  That's reciprocal back and forth. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7352.48s)]
*  Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7354.48s)]
*  If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7360.48s)]
*  There's a lot of that, too. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7373.48s)]
*  They don't even allow us in their market. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7375.48s)]
*  We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7377.48s)]
*  I did it with China and I did it with others. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7384.48s)]
*  And the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money they couldn't do anything about it. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7386.48s)]
*  We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7392.48s)]
*  And we will not let that happen any longer. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7396.48s)]
*  Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7410.48s)]
*  But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7419.48s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7432.48s)]
*  They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7434.48s)]
*  We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7439.48s)]
*  And the United States will not be doing that any longer. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7445.48s)]
*  We're not going to do it any longer. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7449.48s)]
*  Thanks to our America first policies we're putting into place, we have had one point seven trillion dollars of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7455.48s)]
*  The combination of the election and our economic policies that people of SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a two hundred billion dollar investment. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7466.48s)]
*  Open AI and Oracle Larry Ellison announced five hundred billion dollar investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7479.48s)]
*  Apple announced five hundred billion dollar investment. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7491.48s)]
*  Tim Cook called me. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7498.48s)]
*  He said, I cannot spend it fast enough. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7500.48s)]
*  It's going to be much higher than that. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7502.48s)]
*  I believe it'll be building their plants here instead of in China. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7503.48s)]
*  And just yesterday, Taiwan semiconductor, the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7508.48s)]
*  Ninety seven percent of the market announced a one hundred and sixty five billion dollar investment to build the most powerful chips on earth right here in the USA. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7516.48s)]
*  And we're not giving them any money. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7538.48s)]
*  Your chips act is a horrible, horrible thing. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7540.48s)]
*  Horrible thing. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7543.48s)]
*  We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7544.48s)]
*  They take our money and they don't spend it. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7548.48s)]
*  All that meant to them, we're giving them no money. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7550.48s)]
*  All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7554.48s)]
*  So they came and they're building and many other companies are coming. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7557.48s)]
*  We don't have to give them money. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7560.48s)]
*  We just want to protect our businesses and our people. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7562.48s)]
*  And they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7565.48s)]
*  So it's very amazing. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7569.48s)]
*  You should get rid of the chip act and whatever is left over, Mr. Speaker. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7570.48s)]
*  You should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7575.48s)]
*  Our new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7593.48s)]
*  I love the farmer. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7597.48s)]
*  Who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7601.48s)]
*  Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7610.48s)]
*  They're uninspected. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7621.48s)]
*  They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American lives. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7624.48s)]
*  And farmers, the tariffs will go on. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7630.48s)]
*  Agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7633.48s)]
*  It may be a little bit of an adjustment period. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7638.48s)]
*  We had that before when I made the deal with China, 50 billion dollars of purchases. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7642.48s)]
*  And I said, just bear with me. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7646.48s)]
*  And they did. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7648.48s)]
*  They did probably have to bear with me again. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7649.48s)]
*  And this will be even better. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7652.48s)]
*  That was great. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7654.48s)]
*  The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7655.48s)]
*  He didn't enforce it. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7657.48s)]
*  50 billion dollars of purchases and we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it and it hurt our farmers. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7658.48s)]
*  But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7665.48s)]
*  So to our farmers have a lot of fun. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7668.48s)]
*  I love you too. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7672.48s)]
*  I love you too. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7673.48s)]
*  I love you too. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7674.48s)]
*  And I have also imposed a 25 percent tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel, because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly won't have. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7685.48s)]
*  We just won't have a country. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7698.48s)]
*  Today is a proud American steel worker. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7699.48s)]
*  Fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7702.48s)]
*  Jeff Denaard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years and a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7707.48s)]
*  And over the years, provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7724.48s)]
*  So great. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7729.48s)]
*  Jeff. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7730.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7731.48s)]
*  Why Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they're about protecting the soul of our country. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7751.48s)]
*  Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7761.48s)]
*  And it's happening and it will happen rather quickly. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7766.48s)]
*  There'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7768.48s)]
*  It won't be much. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7774.48s)]
*  No, you're not. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7775.48s)]
*  And look and look where Biden took us. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7779.48s)]
*  Very low. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7781.48s)]
*  The lowest we've ever been. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7782.48s)]
*  Jeff, I want to thank you very much. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7783.48s)]
*  And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7785.48s)]
*  She worked so hard on it. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7792.48s)]
*  A very loving person. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7793.48s)]
*  Our magnificent first lady of the United States. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7795.48s)]
*  Melania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7809.48s)]
*  Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7825.48s)]
*  Very impressive. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7828.48s)]
*  Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the first lady's fostering the future initiative and is poised to complete her education, [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7830.48s)]
*  become a teacher and Elliston Berry, who became a victim of an illicit deep fake image produced by a peer. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7838.48s)]
*  With Elliston's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7847.48s)]
*  And this is so important. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7853.48s)]
*  Thank you very much, John. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7856.48s)]
*  John Thule, thank you. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7857.48s)]
*  Stand up, John. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7858.48s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7860.48s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7866.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7874.48s)]
*  And thank you to John Thune and the Senate. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7876.48s)]
*  Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7879.48s)]
*  It's terrible, terrible thing. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7885.48s)]
*  And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7887.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7893.48s)]
*  And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7894.48s)]
*  Because nobody gets treated worse than I do online. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7897.48s)]
*  Nobody. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7900.48s)]
*  That's great. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7902.48s)]
*  Thank you very much to the Senate. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7903.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7904.48s)]
*  But if we truly care about protecting Americans' children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7906.48s)]
*  Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7914.48s)]
*  And many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7919.48s)]
*  Because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies, they are now strongly embedded in our country. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7929.48s)]
*  But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7938.48s)]
*  And I want to thank Tom Homan and Christie. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7949.48s)]
*  I want to thank you and Paul of Border Patrol. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7958.48s)]
*  I want to thank you. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7961.48s)]
*  What a job they've all done. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7962.48s)]
*  Everybody Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7963.48s)]
*  We have to take care of our law enforcement. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7968.48s)]
*  After. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7971.48s)]
*  Last year. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7977.48s)]
*  A brilliant 22 year old nursing student named Lakin Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7983.48s)]
*  That morning, Lakin was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized and horrifically murdered. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=7997.48s)]
*  Lakin was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then set loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8004.48s)]
*  It was indeed a failed administration. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8022.48s)]
*  He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat run sanctuary city, a disaster before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8025.48s)]
*  With us this evening are Lakin's beloved mother, Allison, and her sister, Lauren. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8037.48s)]
*  Last year, I told Lakin's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8055.48s)]
*  That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8074.48s)]
*  It's very strong, powerful act. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8087.48s)]
*  It's called the Lakin Riley Act. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8102.48s)]
*  So Allison and Lauren, America will never ever forget our beautiful Lakin Hope Riley. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8105.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8132.48s)]
*  Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history, and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8144.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8159.48s)]
*  The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8176.48s)]
*  We must have legislation to secure the border. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8182.48s)]
*  But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8185.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8212.48s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8214.48s)]
*  He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8216.48s)]
*  Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8224.48s)]
*  Beautiful towns destroyed. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8235.48s)]
*  Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8238.48s)]
*  But there still is much work to be done here tonight as a woman. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8255.48s)]
*  I have gotten to know Alexis Nungary from Houston. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8262.48s)]
*  Wonderful woman. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8267.48s)]
*  Last June, Alexis's 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8269.48s)]
*  She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge and horrifically murdered. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8276.48s)]
*  Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8283.48s)]
*  The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8295.48s)]
*  Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8303.48s)]
*  Earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8310.48s)]
*  One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8316.48s)]
*  She loved nature. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8321.48s)]
*  Across Galveston Bay from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent National Wildlife Refuge. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8323.48s)]
*  A pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8333.48s)]
*  Alexis, moments ago I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8343.48s)]
*  So, Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8353.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8362.48s)]
*  All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Lakin's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang, the toughest gang they say in the world, known as Trendy Aragua. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8391.48s)]
*  Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8406.48s)]
*  They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that's not good for them. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8433.48s)]
*  Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8440.48s)]
*  But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country, or, if they're too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country, because we don't want them to come back ever. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8447.48s)]
*  With us this evening is a warrior on the front lines of that battle, Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz. Great guy. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8461.48s)]
*  In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8491.48s)]
*  Doesn't sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed, great danger, and he leapt into action, [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8505.48s)]
*  returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, just barely. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8517.48s)]
*  I have some of the prints of that event, and it was not good. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8526.48s)]
*  Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and for your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8532.48s)]
*  We honor you and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8542.48s)]
*  Thank you, Roberto. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8547.48s)]
*  And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8565.48s)]
*  The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture, and exercise total control. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8572.48s)]
*  They have total control over a whole nation, posing a grave threat to our national security. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8583.48s)]
*  The cartels are waging war in America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels, which we are doing. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8590.48s)]
*  Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8608.48s)]
*  handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8618.48s)]
*  That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8624.48s)]
*  But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the USA. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8632.48s)]
*  They're going to stop it. I have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8643.48s)]
*  and complete the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8653.48s)]
*  but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8663.48s)]
*  So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8673.48s)]
*  Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast you won't even believe it. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8681.48s)]
*  And as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8688.48s)]
*  In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8709.48s)]
*  Many jurisdictions virtually seized enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8726.48s)]
*  My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the Constitutional rule of law, [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8739.48s)]
*  starting at the FBI and the DOJ. Pam, good luck. Cash, wherever you may be, good luck. Good luck. Pam Bond. Good luck. So important. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8750.48s)]
*  Gonna do a great job. Cash, thank you. Thank you, Cash. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8766.48s)]
*  They've already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8783.48s)]
*  We're also once again giving our police officers the support, protection, and respect they so dearly deserve. They have to get it. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8789.48s)]
*  They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it and they soon will respect it. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8798.48s)]
*  This also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people and I will never forget them. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8809.48s)]
*  And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers, so I have no chance. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8818.48s)]
*  One year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8831.48s)]
*  He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8847.48s)]
*  He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8856.48s)]
*  I attended Officer Diller's service and when I met his wife and one-year-old son Ryan, it was very inspirational actually. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8868.48s)]
*  His widow's name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Stephanie, thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8880.48s)]
*  Stephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero, New York's finest, and we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets and we're going to do it fast. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8898.48s)]
*  We've got to stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats. We've got to get them out of here. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8918.48s)]
*  I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer and tonight I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8931.48s)]
*  I'm going to pass a new crime bill getting tough on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8956.48s)]
*  They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8969.48s)]
*  Good morning. I said the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is DJ Daniel. He is 13 years old and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=8977.48s)]
*  But in 2018, DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9007.48s)]
*  The doctors gave him five months at most to live. That was more than six years ago. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9033.48s)]
*  Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true and DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9062.48s)]
*  Actually, a number of times. Peace. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9074.48s)]
*  I am asking our new Secret Service Director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States Secret Service. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9084.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9114.48s)]
*  DJ's doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9143.48s)]
*  Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to make America healthy again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9157.48s)]
*  With the name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9187.48s)]
*  Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago, and you can't even believe these numbers, one in 10,000 children had autism, one in 10,000. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9201.48s)]
*  And now it's one in 36. There's something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So we're going to find out what it is. And there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9223.48s)]
*  Okay, Bobby, good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9240.48s)]
*  My administration is also working to protect our children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January, little John and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13 year old little girl. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9256.48s)]
*  Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging her daughter to use a new name and pronouns. They them pronoun actually all without telling January who was here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January. Thank you. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9274.48s)]
*  Thank you. Stories like this are why shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with trans gender ideology. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9304.48s)]
*  I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9327.48s)]
*  And now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9346.48s)]
*  And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9367.48s)]
*  Because we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military and it's already out and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it, don't we? Don't we feel better? [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9392.48s)]
*  Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country. And Pete, congratulations. Secretary of Defense. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9412.48s)]
*  And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well. I am pleased to report that in January the US Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9440.48s)]
*  And you know it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing and thank you very much. Great job. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9467.48s)]
*  We're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather and great grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy when he was just a boy. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9497.48s)]
*  He was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six letter varsity athlete, a really good athlete, they say, a brilliant student with a 4.46. That's good GPA. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9525.48s)]
*  And his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9541.48s)]
*  And Jason, that's a very big deal getting in. That's a hard one to get into. But I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You will soon be joining the Corps of Cadets. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9571.48s)]
*  Thank you. Jason, you're going to be on the long gray line, Jason. As Commander in Chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9601.48s)]
*  As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state of the art Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland, all made in the USA. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9627.48s)]
*  And Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9638.48s)]
*  And other places have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Tim, right? They should have it too. So I want to thank you. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9657.48s)]
*  But it's a very, very important. This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we're going to protect our citizens like never before. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9669.48s)]
*  To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9680.48s)]
*  And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America where it belongs. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9690.48s)]
*  We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact to further enhance our national security. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9710.48s)]
*  My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9722.48s)]
*  The large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9735.48s)]
*  The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9748.48s)]
*  But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9756.48s)]
*  Not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9768.48s)]
*  The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history if you're bringing up to modern day costs. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9777.48s)]
*  It was given away by the Carter administration for $1, but that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9785.48s)]
*  And we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9807.48s)]
*  Marco has been amazing and he's going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9821.48s)]
*  You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman and I feel very certain. So let's assume he got 100 votes. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9829.48s)]
*  And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it. But he's already proven. I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9838.48s)]
*  And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you. Thank you. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9848.48s)]
*  He's doing a great job. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9855.48s)]
*  Great job. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9861.48s)]
*  And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9864.48s)]
*  We strongly support your right to determine your own future. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9870.48s)]
*  And if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America. We need Greenland for national security and even international security. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9875.48s)]
*  And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9884.48s)]
*  And I think we're going to get it one way or the other. We're going to get it. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9891.48s)]
*  We will keep you safe. We will make you rich and together. We will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9898.48s)]
*  It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9907.48s)]
*  America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9915.48s)]
*  Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9922.48s)]
*  Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9935.48s)]
*  Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9944.48s)]
*  And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9952.48s)]
*  And I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9974.48s)]
*  This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9986.48s)]
*  Most of them whose children were murdered and the many people that were so badly over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=9991.48s)]
*  What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, Wow, maybe this is my chance. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10003.48s)]
*  That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10014.48s)]
*  I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones, and they're all in our hearts tonight. Just spoke to them on the phone. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10020.48s)]
*  We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10029.48s)]
*  They were very happy, as happy as you can be under those circumstances. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10038.48s)]
*  Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10042.48s)]
*  In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10053.48s)]
*  In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations, the Abraham Accords. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10058.48s)]
*  And now we're going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10084.48s)]
*  A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People have been talking about that so much lately with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10091.48s)]
*  But a lot of things are happening in the Middle East's rough neighborhood. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10099.48s)]
*  Actually, I'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10103.48s)]
*  Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict with no end in sight. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10109.48s)]
*  The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense with no security. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10118.48s)]
*  Do you want to keep it going for another five years? [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10139.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you would say Pocahontas says yes. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10146.48s)]
*  Two thousand people are being killed every single week. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10161.48s)]
*  More than that. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10165.48s)]
*  They're Russian young people. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10166.48s)]
*  They're Ukrainian young people. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10169.48s)]
*  They're not Americans. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10170.48s)]
*  But I wanted to stop. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10171.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10173.48s)]
*  Think of that. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10182.48s)]
*  They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10183.48s)]
*  And we've spent perhaps three hundred and fifty billion dollars like taking candy from a baby. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10189.48s)]
*  That's what happened. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10196.48s)]
*  And they've spent a hundred billion dollars. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10197.48s)]
*  What a difference that is. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10200.48s)]
*  And we have an ocean separating us and they don't. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10202.48s)]
*  But we're getting along very well with them and lots of good things are happening. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10207.48s)]
*  Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10212.48s)]
*  It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let's equalize. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10221.48s)]
*  You've got to be equal to us. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10226.48s)]
*  Didn't happen earlier today. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10239.48s)]
*  We received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10241.48s)]
*  He to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10246.48s)]
*  Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians, he said. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10252.48s)]
*  My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a piece that lasts. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10256.48s)]
*  We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10264.48s)]
*  Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10271.48s)]
*  I appreciate that he sent this letter just got it a little while ago. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10280.48s)]
*  Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10285.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10294.48s)]
*  Wouldn't that be beautiful? [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10308.48s)]
*  It's time to stop this madness. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10316.48s)]
*  It's time to halt the killing. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10318.48s)]
*  It's time to end this senseless war. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10320.48s)]
*  If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10323.48s)]
*  Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10327.48s)]
*  Rough stuff. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10339.48s)]
*  The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10341.48s)]
*  They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10345.48s)]
*  But last summer, I promised his 95 year old mother, Malfine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10349.48s)]
*  After 22 days in office, I did just that. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10359.48s)]
*  And they are here tonight. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10363.48s)]
*  To Mark and his great mom, we are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10379.48s)]
*  As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10401.48s)]
*  Have you heard of it? [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10409.48s)]
*  For the past 78 years, I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10411.48s)]
*  That was not pleasant. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10419.48s)]
*  And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I was. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10423.48s)]
*  And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10429.48s)]
*  And I never did, did I? [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10433.48s)]
*  Never forgot. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10435.48s)]
*  Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10437.48s)]
*  My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10453.48s)]
*  Cory Comparator was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10459.48s)]
*  When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10471.48s)]
*  Cory knew instantly what it was and what to do. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10475.48s)]
*  He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10479.48s)]
*  Cory was hit really hard. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10487.48s)]
*  You know the story from there. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10491.48s)]
*  He sacrificed his life to save theirs. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10493.48s)]
*  Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10496.48s)]
*  But thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors, we thought they were going to be a great help. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10501.48s)]
*  We thought they were gone and they were saved. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10508.48s)]
*  So those doctors had great talent. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10510.48s)]
*  By Cory's wife Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10513.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10522.48s)]
*  Applause [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10524.48s)]
*  To Helen, Allison, and Kaylee, Cory is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10554.48s)]
*  And he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10563.48s)]
*  Cory was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10568.48s)]
*  It was love like Cory's that built our country and it's love like Cory's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10580.48s)]
*  I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10589.48s)]
*  I was saved by God to make America great again. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10595.48s)]
*  I believe that. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10599.48s)]
*  Applause [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10600.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. From the patriots of Lexington and Concord to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10622.48s)]
*  from the warriors who crossed the Delaware to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10629.48s)]
*  and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk to the astronauts who touched the moon, [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10635.48s)]
*  Americans have always been the people who defied all arts, transcended all dangers, [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10642.48s)]
*  made the most extraordinary sacrifices and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country and our freedom. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10648.48s)]
*  And as we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10655.48s)]
*  Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10667.48s)]
*  Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10674.48s)]
*  And we will fight for it. We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10683.48s)]
*  Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10694.48s)]
*  They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways and graced the world with American marvels [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10707.48s)]
*  like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10717.48s)]
*  They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists all over the world [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10725.48s)]
*  and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10738.48s)]
*  We stand on the shoulders of these warriors who won and built the modern age. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10744.48s)]
*  These workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10760.48s)]
*  These warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10765.48s)]
*  Now it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10774.48s)]
*  And it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling day. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10779.48s)]
*  This will be our greatest era. With God's help over the next four years, [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10787.48s)]
*  we are going to lead this nation even higher and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this earth. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10792.48s)]
*  We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10807.48s)]
*  We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10818.48s)]
*  And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit and we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10848.48s)]
*  Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10860.48s)]
*  My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future because the golden age of America has only just begun. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10878.48s)]
*  It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10903.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10933.48s)]
*  There you have it, Donald Trump delivering his address to the joint sessions of Congress. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10950.48s)]
*  Rock us applause from Republicans, from Vice President J.D. Vance, the speaker, Mike Johnson as he shakes their hands. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10957.48s)]
*  He's been speaking for over a hundred minutes now, Donald Trump, and he said emphatically, America is back. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10965.48s)]
*  Of course, he spoke on a number of topics focusing mostly on immigration, on the economy, excuse me, and Elon Musk's Doge effort as you see Donald Trump continuing to shake hands there. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10974.48s)]
*  And he also talked about culture war issues. There were some disruptions, including at the very beginning with Democrats. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10988.48s)]
*  And we'll talk about all of that. But as we're looking at Donald Trump still in the chamber, they're shaking hands after delivering this speech. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=10994.48s)]
*  I want to bring in our correspondent, Helena Humphrey, who has been watching all of this. She's at the Capitol. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11001.48s)]
*  Helena, just take us through your first thoughts of what we saw. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11007.48s)]
*  Sue me, as we had expected, I think to begin with, it was that laundry list of accomplishments in Donald Trump's view that he achieved in these first six weeks since returning to the White House. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11013.48s)]
*  As you mentioned there, that rallying cry when he took to the stage saying America is back and then pretty swiftly he transitioned to start to speak about those what you might call culture war issues, for example, saying that he had stopped diversity, equity, inclusion practices in government. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11024.48s)]
*  And he also said in the private sector that that was spreading across America. He spoke about a recent executive order mandating English to be the official language. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11044.48s)]
*  And then, of course, that contentious issue as well, renaming, according to the Trump administration, the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11054.48s)]
*  He then also referenced those efforts from the Department of Government Efficiency Initiative spearheaded by Elon Musk, the unelected billionaire to that position. He was in the room. [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11064.48s)]
*  He stood up. He received an applause from Republicans. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11076.48s)]
*  And Donald Trump emphasized once again that when it comes to efforts to reshape the federal government, he said anybody who isn't going back to the office who have been working from home, although he didn't acknowledge that they had been working from home, will be sacked. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11081.48s)]
*  He said if they do not go back to the office. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11096.48s)]
*  It was then at that point that he eventually transitioned to the economy. [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11099.48s)]
*  And that is important, of course, because CBS polling showing us that that is the issue that Americans of both political stripes really wanted to hear about tonight. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11102.48s)]
*  And he said that he was going to make the American economy affordable again. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11113.48s)]
*  He spoke about the price of eggs, for example, which did rise under the Biden administration also due to the avian flu outbreak. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11117.48s)]
*  But he said that that is down to the Biden administration and said that under his policies, he would continue with tariffs, reciprocal tariffs. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11127.48s)]
*  He said, would anybody taxes us or tariffs us? We will tariff them back. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11135.48s)]
*  He said more tariffs to come on the 2nd of April. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11140.48s)]
*  Now, he did indirectly reference the fact that it was a bit of a shaky day on the markets today, reacting to tariffs on Mexico and Canada. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11143.48s)]
*  And he said, yeah, some temporary pain, essentially, is what he said. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11153.48s)]
*  But to be expected and that we will weather that before then getting onto one of those overarching big topics of immigration. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11156.48s)]
*  As you mentioned, some really key guests in the audience invited from the Republicans, including the sister and mother of Lakin Riley, [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11165.48s)]
*  the U.S. nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented immigrant and, of course, one of the first key pieces of legislation that was passed by pass. [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11174.48s)]
*  And, of course, the Lakin Riley Act on undocumented criminals in this country and their deportations. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11184.48s)]
*  And then we met another mother who lost her daughter, 12 year old Jocelyn, also murdered by undocumented immigrants and an executive order. [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11192.48s)]
*  There was a wildlife park in Texas which was renamed in her honor, a really moving moment in the chamber. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11202.48s)]
*  And then what the world was watching for, of course, with regards to foreign policy, specifically with regards to Ukraine. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11210.48s)]
*  Ukraine, Donald Trump saying that he had received a letter today from President Zelensky of Ukraine, essentially saying that he was committed to peace as well [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11217.48s)]
*  and that he wanted to work on his leadership on achieving peace there on the war in Ukraine. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11226.48s)]
*  Also in the audience, the mother of Mark Fogel, you remember, of course, the American teacher who had been imprisoned in Russia, [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11232.48s)]
*  who was returned under the Trump administration. And in some kind of twist of fate, of course, it had been Mark Fogel's mother who had spoken to Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11240.48s)]
*  ahead of that rally, of course, where there was an assassination attempt in July. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11250.48s)]
*  And then Donald Trump kind of wrapped all of this up saying that he believed that it was divine intervention, essentially, [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11256.48s)]
*  that it was God that had saved him on that fateful day with that mandate and duty to make America great again. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11262.48s)]
*  All right, Helena. Thank you so much, Helena Humphrey there at the Capitol. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11269.48s)]
*  As we see Donald Trump here still in the chamber, we saw him just a short while ago as he came down off the dice. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11273.48s)]
*  He was shaking the hands of military leaders, congressional leaders, Supreme Court justices who were on hand as well. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11278.48s)]
*  And we've been seeing a number of members of Congress taking selfies with President Trump there in the background. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11285.48s)]
*  This is the moment, of course, they get to do so in the chamber and a significant moment. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11291.48s)]
*  Donald Trump's first address to this joint session of Congress since being reelected. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11295.48s)]
*  You see some members milling around there. Interesting to note as the speech went on, we did see some Democrats get up and leave the chamber. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11300.48s)]
*  We didn't necessarily see them on camera, but we're receiving reporting that some Democrats had gotten up to leave. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11308.48s)]
*  But now that chamber emptying out. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11315.48s)]
*  So as we're looking at all of this, I want to bring our panel back in. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11317.48s)]
*  We'll stay on these pictures just to get an idea of how things are looking. [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11320.48s)]
*  Rodney and Stephanie and Margaret are still with us. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11324.48s)]
*  And we also have Brian Lansa with us, who's a senior advisor to the Trump Vans campaign. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11327.48s)]
*  And just a note for our viewers, this here is statutory hall. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11331.48s)]
*  So where a lot of those interviews happen after a State of the Union or address a joint session of Congress, that's where you see that big crush of people as people line up. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11334.48s)]
*  And we're going to be speaking to some lawmakers as well. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11343.48s)]
*  But I just want to go around the round here and get your reaction, starting with you, Rodney. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11345.48s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's a triumphant return. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11350.48s)]
*  Donald Trump was pushed out of power in 2021, and he won in a landslide victory when it comes to the Electoral College and the sheer fact that as a Republican, he won the popular vote. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11353.48s)]
*  And he walked back into that chamber and he had a message. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11369.48s)]
*  The message was Democrats, no matter what I say, you're not going to applaud. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11373.48s)]
*  You're not going to understand what my message is. [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11378.48s)]
*  And unfortunately for the Democrats, they played right into his hand. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11381.48s)]
*  They walked out. One member got kicked out of the House chamber. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11385.48s)]
*  That is something that I never witnessed when I was in Congress, when I sat there in those State of the Unions under President Obama, under President Trump and under President Biden. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11389.48s)]
*  Brian? [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11400.48s)]
*  Yeah, I witnessed him talking about the issues there, the early promises he made from the campaign. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11401.48s)]
*  Immigration is a key one. But I think the most important thing you point out, he's causing the Democratic Party to spin out of control. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11407.48s)]
*  They have no message. They're overreacting to things, sort of dilutes whatever message they are going to have. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11412.48s)]
*  And you're going to see more and more of this until they actually find a message that resonates with voters. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11417.48s)]
*  You know, President Trump has done a good job of sort of peeling away the coalition and creating this new coalition. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11421.48s)]
*  And all the arguments the Democratic Party has done for the last four years has failed to connect. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11427.48s)]
*  And he's now more popular than ever and more important. His policies are more popular than ever. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11431.48s)]
*  Look where we were eight years ago. You know, Trump's policies on immigration were far different than they are today. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11435.48s)]
*  Now he's now the vast majority of the population supports deportation. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11440.48s)]
*  When Trump started office, the vast majority of the population supported amnesty. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11445.48s)]
*  The guy is moving the electorate and he's moving policy. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11448.48s)]
*  What's it up to you, Margaret? [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11451.48s)]
*  I think presidents sometimes use things like a joint address or a state of the union to reach across the aisle, [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11453.48s)]
*  to try to bring Republicans and Democrats together for coalition building, to have essential numbers of votes. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11460.48s)]
*  From the moment that President Trump walked into the chamber, you saw him turn to the right and greet Republicans. [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11470.48s)]
*  And at least from the camera angle, as we could see it on the feed, he was not working the left side of the room. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11476.48s)]
*  Just constant partisan goading called Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas. [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11482.48s)]
*  Every time I look away, something would catch my ear and bring me back. [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11487.48s)]
*  So it was a very political victory lap, I told you so, aha kind of speech. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11491.48s)]
*  But if you sort of got past that for a minute and listened, you heard a lot of his policy priorities and a couple sort of real moments. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11499.48s)]
*  The one unity moment I think in the audience that I could hear and see was the moment that a young man, [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11509.48s)]
*  a child who had has been a survivor of brain cancer and outlived the amount of time that the doctors thought he might have left, [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11516.48s)]
*  got deputized either as an honorary Secret Service agent or possibly as a real Secret Service agent. [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11524.48s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11530.48s)]
*  But I mean, a truly joyous, tearful moment that everyone in the room, everyone in the country can get behind. [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11532.48s)]
*  That was not most of the one hour and 40 minutes. I'm having trouble doing the math. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11539.48s)]
*  I think this is a new record. I think the president will be happy to have broken another record, [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11546.48s)]
*  longest joint address to Congress, at least in modern memory, but pretty divisive. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11550.48s)]
*  You might want to time Bill Clinton's last one. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11556.48s)]
*  Might have been longer. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11558.48s)]
*  What's the longer? [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11559.48s)]
*  It was like 90 minutes. [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11560.48s)]
*  We'll look that up. Stephanie, I want to get your reaction as well. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11561.48s)]
*  Well, you know, he had the platform and he always relishes that opportunity. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11564.48s)]
*  I think, though, he came into this speech with the Gallup poll saying that the highest disapproval numbers for him were on issues that the Americans cared the most about, [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11569.48s)]
*  and that was around the economy and foreign trade. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11580.48s)]
*  And I'm not quite sure that he addressed them in a way that assuaged people's concerns about the economy. [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11583.48s)]
*  And as Margaret said in an earlier segment, you can blame the previous president for a certain amount of time. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11590.48s)]
*  But at some point, the buck stops here. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11597.48s)]
*  And instead of saying that these policies were going to lower people's prices, he actually acknowledged, which I was surprised by, that there's going to be some pain. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11599.48s)]
*  And I don't know that the pain is going to be as short-lived as he pitched it to be, because quite honestly, supply side changes. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11610.48s)]
*  You take time to happen. [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11618.48s)]
*  You can't build a factory overnight and immediately, you know, produce things in the U.S. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11621.48s)]
*  Just because we're getting the rebuttal now from Senator Slotkin, Alyssa Slotkin. Let's listen in. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11627.48s)]
*  Before the smoke cleared, I knew I wanted to make a life in national security. [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11632.48s)]
*  I was recruited by the CIA and did three tours in Iraq alongside the military. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11637.48s)]
*  In between, I worked at the White House under President Bush and President Obama, two very different leaders who both believed that America is exceptional. [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11642.48s)]
*  You can find that same sense of patriotism here in Wyandotte, Michigan, where I'm speaking from tonight. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11651.48s)]
*  It's a working-class town just south of Detroit. President Trump and I both won here in November. [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11657.48s)]
*  It might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist across the United States, places where people believe that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids should do better. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11664.48s)]
*  It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat. [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11676.48s)]
*  But it was never a big deal because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party. [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11681.48s)]
*  We just went through another fraught election season. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11689.48s)]
*  Americans made it clear that prices are too high and that the government needs to be more responsive to their needs. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11692.48s)]
*  America wants change, but there's a responsible way to make change and a reckless way. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11698.48s)]
*  And we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country and as a democracy. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11704.48s)]
*  So that's what I'm going to lay out tonight. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11710.48s)]
*  Because whether you're from Wyandotte or Wichita, most Americans share three core beliefs that the middle class is the engine of our country, that strong national security protects us from harm, and that our democracy, no matter how messy, is unparalleled and worth fighting for. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11712.48s)]
*  Let's start with the economy. Michigan literally invented the middle class, the revolutionary idea that you could work at an auto plant and afford the car you were building. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11730.48s)]
*  That's the American dream. And in order to expand and protect the middle class, we have to do a few basic things. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11741.48s)]
*  We need to bring down the price of things we spend the most money on, groceries, housing, health care. [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11748.48s)]
*  We need to make more things in America with good paying union jobs and bring our supply chains back home from places like China. [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11753.48s)]
*  We need to give American businesses the certainty they need to invest and create the jobs of the future. [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11761.48s)]
*  And we need a tax system that's fair for people who don't happen to make a billion dollars. [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11768.48s)]
*  Look, the president talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print. [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11773.48s)]
*  So do his plans actually help Americans get ahead? Not even close. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11778.48s)]
*  President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11784.48s)]
*  He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America. [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11790.48s)]
*  And to do that, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life. [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11795.48s)]
*  Grocery and home prices are going up, not down. And he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either of those. [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11800.48s)]
*  His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber and cars and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11807.48s)]
*  Your premiums and prescriptions will cost more because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your health care. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11816.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, for those keeping score, the national debt is going up, not down. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11824.48s)]
*  And if he's not careful, he could walk us right into a recession. [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11829.48s)]
*  And one more thing. In order to pay for his plan, he could very well come after your retirement. [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11833.48s)]
*  The Social Security, Medicare and VA benefits you worked your whole life to earn. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11839.48s)]
*  The president claims he won't, but Elon Musk just called Social Security the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time. [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11844.48s)]
*  While we're on the subject of Elon Musk, is there anyone in America who is comfortable with him and his gang of 20 year olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns, your health information and your bank accounts? [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11851.48s)]
*  No oversight, no protections against cyber attack, no guardrails on what they do with your private data. [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11864.48s)]
*  We need a more efficient government. You want to cut waste? I'll help you do it. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11872.48s)]
*  But change doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe. [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11877.48s)]
*  The mindless firing of people who work to protect our nuclear weapons, keep our planes from crashing and conduct the research that finds the cure for cancer, only to rehire them two days later. [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11881.48s)]
*  No CEO in America could do that without being summarily fired. [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11893.48s)]
*  Okay, so we've talked about economic security. How about national security? [[03:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11898.48s)]
*  Let's start with the border. As someone who spent my whole career protecting our homeland, every country deserves to know who and what is coming across its border. [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11903.48s)]
*  Period. Democrats and Republicans should all be for that. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11912.48s)]
*  But securing the border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom and not the disease. [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11916.48s)]
*  America is a nation of immigrants. We need a functional system key to the needs of our economy that allows vetted people to come and work here legally. [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11923.48s)]
*  So I look forward to the president's plan on that. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11933.48s)]
*  Because here's the thing. Today's world is deeply interconnected. Migration, cyber threats, AI, environmental destruction, terrorism. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11936.48s)]
*  One nation cannot face these issues alone. We need friends in all corners and our safety depends on it. [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11945.48s)]
*  President Trump loves to say peace through strength. That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11952.48s)]
*  But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling in his grave. [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11959.48s)]
*  We all want an end to the war in Ukraine, but Reagan understood that true strength required America to combine our military and economic might with moral clarity. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11967.48s)]
*  And that scene in the Oval Office wasn't just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump's whole approach to the world. [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11977.48s)]
*  He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends like the Canadians in the teeth. [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11985.48s)]
*  He sees American leadership as merely a series of real estate transactions. [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11993.48s)]
*  As a Cold War kid, I'm thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War. [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=11998.48s)]
*  Donald Trump's actions suggest that in his heart, he doesn't believe we're an exceptional nation. [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12006.48s)]
*  He clearly doesn't think we should lead the world. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12013.48s)]
*  Look, America is not perfect, but I stand with the majority of Americans who believe we are still exceptional, unparalleled. [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12016.48s)]
*  And I would rather have American leadership over Chinese or Russian leadership any day of the week. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12023.48s)]
*  Because for generations, America has offered something better. Our security and our prosperity, yes, but our democracy, our very system of government, has been the aspiration of the world. [[03:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12030.48s)]
*  And right now, it's at risk. It's at risk when the president decides you can pick and choose what rules you want to follow, when he ignores court orders and the Constitution itself, or when elected leaders stand by and just let it happen. [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12041.48s)]
*  But it's also at risk when the president pits Americans against each other, when he demonizes those who are different and tells certain people they shouldn't be included. [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12056.48s)]
*  Because America is not just a patch of land between two oceans. We are more than that. Generations have fought and died to secure the fundamental rights that define us. [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12067.48s)]
*  Those rights and the fight for them make us who we are. We're a nation of strivers, risk takers, innovators, and we are never satisfied. That is America's superpower. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12078.48s)]
*  And look, I've lived and worked in many countries. I've seen democracies flicker out. I've seen what life is like when a government is rigged. You can't open a business without paying off a corrupt official. [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12091.48s)]
*  You can't criticize the guys in charge without getting a knock at the door in the middle of the night. So as much as we need to make our government more responsive to our lives today, don't for one moment fool yourself that democracy isn't precious and worth saving. [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12103.48s)]
*  But how do we actually do that? I know a lot of you have been asking that question. First, don't tune out. It's easy to be exhausted, but America needs you now more than ever. If previous generations had not fought for this democracy, where would we be today? [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12118.48s)]
*  Second, hold your elected officials, including me, accountable. Watch how they're voting. Go to town halls and demand they take action. That's as American as apple pie. [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12135.48s)]
*  Third, organize. Pick just one issue you're passionate about and engage. And doom scrolling doesn't count. Join a group that cares about your issue and act. And if you can't find one, start one. Some of the most important movements in our history have come from the bottle up. [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12146.48s)]
*  In closing, we all know that our country is going through something right now. We're not sure what the next day is going to hold, let alone the next decade. But this isn't the first time we've experienced significant and tumultuous change as a country. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12164.48s)]
*  I'm a student of history, and we've gone through periods of political instability before. And ultimately, we've chosen to keep changing this country for the better. But every single time, we've only gotten through those moments because of two things. [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12180.48s)]
*  Engage citizens and principled leaders. Engage citizens who do a little bit more than they're used to doing to fight for the things that they care about. And principled leaders who are ready to receive the ball and do something about it. [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12195.48s)]
*  So thank you tonight for caring about your country just by watching you qualify as engaged citizens. And I promise that I and my fellow Democrats will do everything in our power to be the principled leaders that you deserve. Good night, everyone. [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12210.48s)]
*  All right. That was Democrat Senator Alyssa Slotkin delivering the Democratic rebuttal there to President Trump's address to the joint sessions of Congress. She touched on the same array of issues that Donald Trump did in his speech and was speaking to Democrats and also voters across the country on a number of those issues. [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12225.48s)]
*  But we want to get right to the Capitol to get some reactions from those who were in the chamber, lawmakers who were witnessing the speech there live. And we have Representative Jennifer McClellan with us, a Democrat Congresswoman from the state of Virginia. [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12249.48s)]
*  Congresswoman, good to see you again. Thanks for joining us. First of all, what's your reaction to the president's speech tonight? [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12264.48s)]
*  Well, you know, I walked into that chamber hoping to hear the president talk about putting the American people above politics. But that's not what I heard. What I heard was two hours of half truths or outright lies. [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12272.48s)]
*  What I heard was an American president trying to pit one group of Americans against another and play into not even dog whistles anymore, but outright bigotry. [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12286.48s)]
*  I heard a president putting forth economic policies that will hurt the American people, that will raise costs of everything from gasoline to groceries, from toys to technology and from health care to housing. [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12298.48s)]
*  I heard a president who parroted talking points from Vladimir Putin, who threatened our allies and our friends and who has this dystopian view of America and the American people that does not reflect the America that I see every day. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12314.48s)]
*  And I heard a president who puts the tax breaks of billionaires above the needs of the American people. [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12334.48s)]
*  Congresswoman, he touched, of course, on a number of issues in his speech. And when we look at immigration, we know from ahead of the election that a number of Americans wanted to see real action on immigration. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12341.48s)]
*  And what he said here is that he referred to the legislation that wasn't passed in Congress. And he said, it turns out all we really needed was a new president. He pointed to the numbers of people who have been apprehended since he took office. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12353.48s)]
*  Is this a point where Democrats don't perhaps have the answer, where President Trump says, I do look at the numbers since I took office? [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12365.48s)]
*  Well, we did have the answers. We know that to address the border, you need to invest in border security. [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12374.48s)]
*  That does not mean taking your military or your FBI agents from doing their job, putting them on the border. [[03:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12382.48s)]
*  That means investing in new border agents who are trained to deal with the border while you continue to have your military take care of your other national security needs here at home and around the country while you have FBI agents who are doing their job. [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12390.48s)]
*  And so we had a plan to do that. And Donald Trump scuttled it. [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12407.48s)]
*  Speaking of plans for Democrats, what did you think of your fellow member of Congress, Representative Green, disrupting the speech at the beginning? Do you think that was the right approach? [[03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12412.48s)]
*  That's not the approach that I took. It was very difficult to sit through that speech. [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12424.48s)]
*  And I'm not going to get into Representative Green's head to talk about why he did or did not do what he did. [[03:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12429.48s)]
*  But I can say that for anyone who sat through the civil rights era, anyone who sat through the Cold War, anyone who sat through the progress that this country has made to make the ideals upon which we were founded true for everyone, [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12437.48s)]
*  would have found that speech difficult to stomach. And so I reacted by sitting and listening to what the president had to say because I wanted to hear every lie that he said so that I could rebut it. [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12453.48s)]
*  Other members chose to do a different way. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12465.48s)]
*  Congresswoman, before we let you go, you disagree with the policy proposals the president laid out. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12468.48s)]
*  What exactly do Democrats plan to do going forward? [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12473.48s)]
*  Well, first of all, we are going to fight Republican efforts to strip health care from 80 million Americans to give tax cuts to billionaires. [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12478.48s)]
*  We are focused on meeting the needs of the American people. We are focused on making sure we lower costs, not increase them. [[03:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12488.48s)]
*  We are focused on protecting our federal workforce and the essential services that they provide from the attacks of Donald Trump and Elon Musk and Russell Vaught, [[03:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12495.48s)]
*  who said he wanted to traumatize our federal workforce. And they fired so many of them that include veterans and our friends and neighbors. [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12505.48s)]
*  We're going to fight back. [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12513.48s)]
*  Okay, Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us tonight on BBC News. [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12515.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12520.48s)]
*  And we will, of course, get reaction from the other side of the aisle. [[03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12521.48s)]
*  Congresswoman Stephanie Bice will be joining us shortly. [[03:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12524.48s)]
*  But in the meantime, I do want to bring in our panel on some of what we just heard because between when we discussed your initial reactions to the speech and now we did hear the rebuttal as well. [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12527.48s)]
*  So Rodney, what are your thoughts on what we heard from Senator Slotkin and, of course, Congresswoman McClellan there as well? [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12537.48s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. There was really not any reference by my former colleague, Senator Slotkin, to the disruptions that Democrats, her fellow Democrats, put forth. [[03:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12544.48s)]
*  Maybe it's because she's in Michigan, which is great. [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12555.48s)]
*  You know, she gets to highlight her home state, which I think is a very good move for her. [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12558.48s)]
*  But there's a lot of scare tactics. You know, President Trump could cut Social Security when he said he's not going to. [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12564.48s)]
*  And frankly, if American, if elected officials in Washington really want to tackle the drivers of the debt in this country, they got to look at mandatory spending. [[03:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12572.48s)]
*  I'm not there anymore, but when I was there, I said this. But there's not a lot of courage to be able to do that. [[03:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12582.48s)]
*  So what does that mean, looking at mandatory spending? [[03:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12588.48s)]
*  You have to look at the mandatory spending programs. You have to look at Social Security, Medicare and others to be able to. [[03:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12590.48s)]
*  And there are things that you can do to make sure that you don't use scare tactics like he could cut Social Security when you could make sure that everyone who's on those programs gets the benefits they deserve. [[03:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12596.48s)]
*  But you know what? I think many grandparents in this country want to save Social Security and Medicare for their grandkids. [[03:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12609.48s)]
*  Stephanie, what's your thought on this? Because this is a line we are seeing that has been picked up quite a bit by Democrats in response to speech to say, watch out. [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12615.48s)]
*  This is kind of a cardinal sign from what we've seen in the speech that these programs like Social Security might be affected. [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12624.48s)]
*  Well, let me just first say that I thought that Senator Slotkin did an incredible job providing a rebuttal. [[03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12631.48s)]
*  She spoke in plain English. She spoke with the dignity of her office, which was missing, I think, in a lot of our politics today. [[03:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12637.48s)]
*  And she talked to the issues that the American people care about. [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12646.48s)]
*  And she spoke about security as well as economic security, which are the basic principles of what Americans need to have in this country. [[03:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12652.48s)]
*  Regarding the, you know, I think there's plenty of scare tactics and a little bit of misinformation going about regarding what needs to happen. [[03:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12663.48s)]
*  You hear Republicans talk about how they're going to cut the deficit with just pure removal of fraud, waste and abuse. [[03:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12677.48s)]
*  That is a good goal to remove fraud, waste and abuse. [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12685.48s)]
*  But I assure you that having sat on the Ways and Means Committee, that number is not large enough to actually make a dent or to pay for the tax cuts that they want to give to the wealthy. [[03:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12688.48s)]
*  And so really, when you look at the overall plan that the Republicans have put forward, there are there is no way that they can hit the numbers that they have set out in the budget framework without touching entitlements. [[03:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12699.48s)]
*  And, you know, and the economists have said that their proposals are going to lower GDP. [[03:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12713.48s)]
*  So we're looking at lower growth. [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12720.48s)]
*  We're looking at lower growth, higher deficits and a significant impact on the prices that the American people pay at the grocery stores. [[03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12724.48s)]
*  Come back to the bigger picture here a bit, Margaret, starting with you and then Brian. [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12733.48s)]
*  I mean, was the president here in addressing all of this was very clear. [[03:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12738.48s)]
*  He said that, you know, we're going to balance the budget. [[03:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12742.48s)]
*  Of course, we don't know how that would happen, but that the economy is going to be strong and that America is back this golden age. [[03:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12744.48s)]
*  What does that mean for the coming weeks and months? [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12752.48s)]
*  Well, what he's asking for is a runway. [[03:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12755.48s)]
*  He's asking for American patience in the face of prices that have not gone have not, you know, inflation didn't disappear. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12758.48s)]
*  And in fact, there's some indicators that could drive it forward. [[03:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12769.48s)]
*  But I think what he's saying is give me a little bit of time. [[03:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12773.48s)]
*  I know what I'm doing is drastic, but I'm doing it for the right reasons and you'll get good results. [[03:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12776.48s)]
*  The question is, how much time is that going to buy? [[03:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12781.48s)]
*  And I think if you were in the chamber tonight and you were someone like Hakeem Jeffries or Nancy Pelosi, [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12783.48s)]
*  the current and most recent leader of the Democrats in the House, there were a lot of there was a lot of performance maybe that you didn't want from within your own caucus. [[03:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12790.48s)]
*  The signs and the waving the cane and storming out and stuff. [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12802.48s)]
*  I think Senator Slotkin was what those party leaders did want. [[03:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12807.48s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not a partisan. [[03:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12811.48s)]
*  I'm neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but just watching her response seemed like what is a rare moment of Democratic sort of like clarity, but almost like a centrist message that's really data driven. [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12813.48s)]
*  And I thought like they were to be hearing and seeing a lot more from her. [[03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12828.48s)]
*  I was interested in seeing the messages that she pulled out because I think they go to some of the things that voters in the middle or swingable voters worry about or think about that we hear about consistently. [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12835.48s)]
*  The idea that they're not super comfortable with Elon Musk getting into their private data concerns about entitlements, right? [[03:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12848.48s)]
*  That sort of thing. [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12855.48s)]
*  And and the idea that the world's interconnected, that you can't just do something without having ripple effects around the world. [[03:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12857.48s)]
*  The Reagan line, I think, was aimed at Republicans. [[03:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12867.48s)]
*  I'm not sure if it'll end that way. [[03:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12870.48s)]
*  Most of the Republican Party. [[03:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12872.48s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party today, not Ronald Reagan. [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12873.48s)]
*  And coming back to Donald Trump, Brian, I mean, a very confident tone from him, obviously, after this flurry of activity we've seen during his first weeks. [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12877.48s)]
*  What do you think he is setting out, as I just asked Margaret, for the coming weeks? [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12886.48s)]
*  He's setting out delivery. [[03:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12891.48s)]
*  He's telling people what I'm going to continue to deliver on. [[03:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12892.48s)]
*  I mean, this you have to forget this. [[03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12895.48s)]
*  This is this is a second term. [[03:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12896.48s)]
*  This is extension of his first term. [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12897.48s)]
*  You know, first term was promises made promises kept. [[03:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12899.48s)]
*  That's all he knows as a business guy. [[03:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12902.48s)]
*  You know, they create a punch list and they go through it. [[03:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12903.48s)]
*  And we're going to continue to see Trump go through this punch list every month, every month. [[03:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12906.48s)]
*  And I'll say this about the senator's response. [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12909.48s)]
*  You know, everything she said tonight, you know, I heard before the election. [[03:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12912.48s)]
*  So it's nothing new. [[03:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12915.48s)]
*  I think that's the problem the Democratic Party has is they have no message against Donald Trump. [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12916.48s)]
*  Everything she said tonight, whether it was the economy, whether it's national security, the only thing different was Elon Musk. [[03:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12920.48s)]
*  But that same speech, she said, I probably heard a thousand times before November. [[03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12926.48s)]
*  So for me, it highlights the fact that the Democrats are lost. [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12930.48s)]
*  They need to find a message. [[03:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12932.48s)]
*  And yes, she had a strong delivery of a message and she gave a good performance. [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12934.48s)]
*  But the message was lost in November. [[03:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12937.48s)]
*  Well, we'll come back to the Republicans now because we do have Congresswoman Stephanie Bice who's standing by for us as she's at the Capitol, obviously. [[03:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12939.48s)]
*  Congresswoman, great to see you. [[03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12947.48s)]
*  Good to have you back on BBC News. [[03:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12948.48s)]
*  What was your reaction to the president's speech tonight? [[03:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12951.48s)]
*  Well, it's great to be back with you. [[03:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12958.48s)]
*  And I think the message is that America is back and he really laid out his vision for the next four years, [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12959.48s)]
*  which is exactly what we were expecting to hear him talk about. [[03:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12965.48s)]
*  The guests that he brought tonight were remarkable and we're looking forward to executing on the vision now. [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12969.48s)]
*  If we talk about the economy, Congresswoman, we know that he did speak about tariffs as well. [[03:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12976.48s)]
*  And he said there's going to be a little bit of disruption there, but we're going to be OK. [[03:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12980.48s)]
*  Are you concerned about that disruption for your constituents? [[03:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12985.48s)]
*  You know, this is sort of what happened in his prior term. [[03:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12992.48s)]
*  You know, he's either levy tariffs or threatens to levy tariffs on countries because he wanted to level the playing field. [[03:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=12995.48s)]
*  And it worked. These countries came to the table, negotiated what we consider to be a win-win for both sides. [[03:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13002.48s)]
*  And that's what President Trump wants to do once again. [[03:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13008.48s)]
*  It's not fair, as he mentioned in his speech, that some countries are taxing U.S. goods 30, 40, 50 percent or even more. [[03:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13011.48s)]
*  And so he wants to make sure that countries understand that we can't be taken advantage of any longer. [[03:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13019.48s)]
*  And so these new tariffs that are being either put in place or discussed are a way to bring people to the table. [[03:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13024.48s)]
*  And it's effective. You've seen it already working with Mexico and Canada. [[03:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13030.48s)]
*  He did also speak at length about the Department of Government Efficiency and praised Elon Musk. [[03:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13035.48s)]
*  Do you think that this is, you know, a series of cuts that we've seen, of course, thousands of workers who have lost their jobs. [[03:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13042.48s)]
*  This is a message that is going to also land well with your constituents, with voters across the country. [[03:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13049.48s)]
*  Look, I think voters spoke loudly when they voted for Donald Trump in November. [[03:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13058.48s)]
*  And he is executing on his vision. And people want to see government rights size. [[03:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13063.48s)]
*  The bureaucracy is out of control. The United States is $36 trillion in debt and we can't continue down the same path. [[03:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13068.48s)]
*  Doge is looking at every agency to find efficiencies to rein in the wasteful spending and to try to put this country on a firm fiscal footing for the future. [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13075.48s)]
*  Without them, we are likely to get going to continue to rack up debt. And this is unsustainable. [[03:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13086.48s)]
*  It's sustainable. Oklahomans recognize that there's going to be some pain that will go along with this. [[03:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13091.48s)]
*  But the long term actual benefit for the country is really what he's focused on. [[03:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13096.48s)]
*  When you listen to what the president laid out in terms of his policies, what do you think the priorities are going to be after these first few weeks of his term going ahead now to the next phase? [[03:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13102.48s)]
*  Sure. I think the economy is going to be his big focus right now. [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13116.48s)]
*  He has done quite a bit of work on the border, southern and northern border, in reducing the number of individuals coming across. [[03:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13119.48s)]
*  So the next step is really, in my opinion, looking at how do we get manufacturing, reshoring manufacturing to the United States? [[03:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13126.48s)]
*  How do we bring jobs back to the country? How do we increase innovation, invest in technology? [[03:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13133.48s)]
*  All of these things are going to put us in a position to be incredibly successful from an economic perspective. [[03:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13140.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what he wants to see. I think you'll see a lot of that over the next weeks and months. [[03:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13146.48s)]
*  We're here to point to the former president, Joe Biden, when it comes to the price of eggs. [[03:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13151.48s)]
*  We know, of course, part of the reason is the avian flu, the bird flu, that we've seen this shortage of eggs and the prices go up. [[03:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13155.48s)]
*  What needs to happen to bring those prices down immediately? [[03:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13162.48s)]
*  Well, I think we need to recognize that we may be overzealous in actually destroying some of the stock that's out there. [[03:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13169.48s)]
*  It may not be necessary. So really looking at the Department of Ag and what their plan is, is going to be important. [[03:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13177.48s)]
*  Increasing production is a possibility. Looking at other viable growth opportunities within that industry are important. [[03:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13184.48s)]
*  And I think he'll do that. But that's just one piece of this puzzle. [[03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13195.48s)]
*  I mean, there are so many products that we have seen a huge increase in cost over the last four years, 25 percent in must food items. [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13198.48s)]
*  And so it's not just eggs. It's all these other things. [[03:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13208.48s)]
*  And the reason that this really inflation began was because of the price of energy. [[03:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13211.48s)]
*  We saw gas prices spike to five dollars a gallon. [[03:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13217.48s)]
*  And when you increase transportation costs, you increase food costs as well. [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13220.48s)]
*  So he has been committed, which is important to my state, on energy dominance, bringing down the price of energy. [[03:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13224.48s)]
*  That will help us reduce the price of goods and services across the country. [[03:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13231.48s)]
*  OK, Congresswoman, always good to have you on BBC News. [[03:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13235.48s)]
*  Congresswoman Stephanie Bice, thank you so much. [[03:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13239.48s)]
*  All right. And we also want to take a look at some of what we heard from the president during his address, the joint sessions of Congress tonight. [[03:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13243.48s)]
*  We have Merlin Thomas from BBC Verify, who's been looking into various aspects of the president's address, Merlin. [[03:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13250.48s)]
*  And, you know, we were just talking about some of the points that the president made on the Department of Government Efficiency Doge, particularly on these accusations of waste and fraud. [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13258.48s)]
*  What did you find from the president's address? [[03:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13269.48s)]
*  Yes. So he spoke a lot about Doge and listed off a number of different numbers and contracts. [[03:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13273.48s)]
*  And that is what really our team at BBC Verify have been looking at and investigating. [[03:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13279.48s)]
*  And I just want to bring you up to speed with some of those because he specified that there was fraud, waste and theft. [[03:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13284.48s)]
*  But there have been questions about the scale of those savings on the Doge's website. [[03:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13290.48s)]
*  They specify one hundred and five billion dollars have been saved. [[03:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13297.48s)]
*  And that's their estimate. And they list a number of ways that that has been calculated. [[03:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13302.48s)]
*  But they only list a specific number of contracts. [[03:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13307.48s)]
*  So that figure can't actually be independently verified because they so far have only published receipts from a particular number of those areas that they have made those savings that they claim. [[03:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13311.48s)]
*  Those savings add up to about eighteen point six billion dollars. [[03:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13324.48s)]
*  Now, BBC Verify have asked for evidence of the remaining eighty six billion dollars of savings. [[03:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13329.48s)]
*  But those are just kind of some of the numbers that we've been looking at when we look at some of those that he's quoted. [[03:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13335.48s)]
*  And we've also heard from other U.S. media outlets. You know, they've looked at some of the other accounting errors on the on Doge's website as well. [[03:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13342.48s)]
*  For example, it listed one of the largest savings of an immigration agency contract is eight billion. [[03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13349.48s)]
*  But that was then changed to eight million. [[03:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13356.48s)]
*  And Merlin, I also want to ask you about the president's words on the war in Ukraine. [[03:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13361.48s)]
*  Obviously, you know, a lot of eyes international looking at looking at what the president would say specifically on U.S. [[03:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13365.48s)]
*  support for Ukraine after that news that came out last night that the U.S. [[03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13372.48s)]
*  was suspending weapons assistance. [[03:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13376.48s)]
*  He talked about the billions of dollars that were spent already from the U.S. [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13379.48s)]
*  What did you find there? Yes. [[03:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13384.48s)]
*  So he said that we spent we sent the three hundred and fifty billion dollars and Europe spent one hundred billion dollars. [[03:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13386.48s)]
*  Now, those numbers are some some things that he's claimed before that are unsubstantiated because we haven't been able to find any evidence of this claim. [[03:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13394.48s)]
*  Our colleagues at BBC Verify have looked into those numbers and they haven't seen such evidence. [[03:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13403.48s)]
*  In fact, the U.S. is by some margin the largest single donor of aid to Ukraine. [[03:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13408.48s)]
*  But according to the Kiel Institute think tank, Europe as a whole have actually sent one hundred and thirty eight billion dollars. [[03:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13414.48s)]
*  Whereas for the U.S., they have accounted for a spending of one hundred and nineteen billion dollars. [[03:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13422.48s)]
*  And it's important that we look at these numbers because this is something that President Trump brings up time and time again when he's referring to aid. [[03:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13428.48s)]
*  And of course, with the pause on the aid funding, it's significant that he is bringing out these numbers that we haven't been able to substantiate ourselves. [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13436.48s)]
*  All right, Merlin Thomas, as always, thank you so much for that. [[03:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13444.48s)]
*  And I want to stay with Ukraine now to get a reaction to what we heard from the president speaking about a letter that President Zelensky had sent him. [[03:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13449.48s)]
*  We have Janabes Piotr with us from the BBC's Ukrainian service. [[03:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13458.48s)]
*  And as we know, Jana, people have been watching this very closely to see what the president would say. [[03:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13462.48s)]
*  What reactions have you seen from Ukrainian voices? [[03:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13468.48s)]
*  You know, it's early morning in Ukraine now, so I think the reactions will come in a couple of hours. [[03:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13472.48s)]
*  But the first thing that I definitely can highlight that we didn't hear any any clear vision of what Donald Trump means by the peace, [[03:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13481.48s)]
*  what he means by the deal with Russia. [[03:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13496.48s)]
*  And again, we didn't hear anything about any security guarantees for Ukraine and even whether he is ready to resume the supply of ammunition and weapons to Ukraine and whether he is in general ready to to resume the support for Ukraine, [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13500.48s)]
*  which was put on hold completely. [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13521.48s)]
*  And of course, it's a very tough moment for Ukraine because even the ammunition and arms that were already planned to be delivered to Ukraine within next days from Poland, they all are frozen now. [[03:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13524.48s)]
*  So basically, I think Ukrainians didn't get any answers or more clarity apart from hearing how the American president read the letter that he received from the Ukrainian president. [[03:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13541.48s)]
*  Wysminski stated that Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table and ready to sign the agreement on the minerals. [[03:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13554.48s)]
*  Shana, it did sound like this letter was positively received, however, and after that extraordinary spat that we saw at the White House last week, does this perhaps help towards repairing that relationship? [[03:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13562.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[03:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13576.48s)]
*  Exactly. I think that's a move, a diplomatic and political move that came from the Ukrainian side, more precisely from Volodymyr Zelensky, which was very much needed to bring hope back basically to both sides in this story. [[03:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13579.48s)]
*  And, you know, even a few days afterwards, if you listen to what people are speaking in Kiev or across the country, what I hear, everybody talks about that argument that took place between the Zelensky and Donald Trump in the White House. [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13596.48s)]
*  So, of course, I think it's seen also quite positively in Ukraine that there is this hope and sign that the negotiations and more generally relations between the US and Ukraine can be restored to some extent, because for Ukraine, obviously, it's a vital issue. [[03:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13618.48s)]
*  It's a vital issue, at least the US presence in this process, because I think very few people still believe that Donald Trump is ready to provide Ukraine with clear security guarantees, which is absolutely essential for the country. [[03:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13642.48s)]
*  Okay, Shana, well, thank you so much. I know it's very late or very early there in Kiev, either way. [[03:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13662.48s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us and giving us that reaction to the address. [[03:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13667.48s)]
*  I'm going to come back to the panel here, Stephanie, start with you, because we should talk about the war in Ukraine as well. [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13672.48s)]
*  We heard Donald Trump say that he's had serious discussions with Russia and received strong signals that they are ready for peace. [[03:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13678.48s)]
*  The Trump administration's point is he is the only one who has brought these players to the table. [[03:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13686.48s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[03:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13691.48s)]
*  I think that his speech not only does it give fact checkers a lot of work to do, it also gives the average American a lot of contradictions to try to work through. [[03:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13694.48s)]
*  In some ways, as it relates to Ukraine, he is talking about a more isolationist position, and that's in line with where the American people are. [[03:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13706.48s)]
*  The majority of the American people would like to see an end to that conflict and also to see the United States not involved. [[03:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13716.48s)]
*  But on the other hand, when it comes to Panama and Greenland, it's very much an interventionist perspective. [[03:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13722.48s)]
*  And so I think if you look at his foreign policy in context, it's filled with contradictions. [[03:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13729.48s)]
*  In some places, we may be taking land and taking by force something that belongs to other countries. [[03:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13734.48s)]
*  And in Ukraine, we're willing to hand it off to Putin. [[03:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13743.48s)]
*  And so I think allies and adversaries alike are recalibrating to this new America First foreign policy. [[03:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13750.48s)]
*  Brian, what do you think? Do you see that contradiction there that Stephanie painted? [[03:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13761.48s)]
*  No, listen, I think if you step back, it all actually does connect. [[03:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13764.48s)]
*  If you look at who's sitting across the chessboard from Donald Trump, it's China. It's not Russia. It's not the Democratic Party. It's not Gavin Newsom. It's China. [[03:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13768.48s)]
*  And if you sort of look and understand that China's a cost of transport, you see that Russia plays a more important role in that conversation with China than Ukraine. [[03:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13776.48s)]
*  And you see the Panama Canal, what's his biggest concern about the Panama Canal, that it's going to become under China control. [[03:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13784.48s)]
*  And you look at Greenland. It's not necessarily China there, but it's the security space. [[03:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13790.48s)]
*  So I think people oftentimes, they may be confused by President Trump, what he wants to do. [[03:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13795.48s)]
*  But when you step back and look at the complete picture, China's sitting across the table from him. [[03:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13799.48s)]
*  And everything he's talking from a foreign policy standpoint is to address the threat and concern of China. [[03:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13803.48s)]
*  Well, we know that he has raised tariffs on China. I think we have a clip of Trump's speech when he's talking about those tariffs. Let's play that now. [[03:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13808.48s)]
*  April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in. And whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal. [[03:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13814.48s)]
*  Back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. [[03:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13826.48s)]
*  Rodney, you said you'd be looking very closely to see what the president said on tariffs because of concerns that small businesses have, for example. What did you think of that message? [[03:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13846.48s)]
*  I certainly wish he would have gone further on tariffs. I certainly wish that he would have addressed the tariffs that he implemented on Canada and Mexico and taken those tariffs away. [[03:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13855.48s)]
*  It's unprecedented that the president is talking about using the IEPA process to do blanket tariffs on two of our greatest trading partners. [[03:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13864.48s)]
*  It's an issue that could adversely affect small businesses and larger businesses throughout our country. [[03:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13873.48s)]
*  This is an issue that I think he and his team are going to be keenly aware of if it begins to continue to impact the economy and inflation. [[03:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13880.48s)]
*  And I do believe that he will react. I certainly hope that he is accurate in saying maybe it's temporary. What does that temporary status mean? We don't know. [[03:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13890.48s)]
*  But the bottom line is when you look at the overall speech, Donald Trump gave a speech that his supporters and the Republicans in the House and the Senate wanted him to give. [[03:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13902.48s)]
*  It was a speech laying out his vision, laying out what he wants to do when it comes to domestic policies and foreign policies. [[03:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13913.48s)]
*  You know, we have a lot of talk about Ukraine just a minute ago, a lot of talk in this, you know, in the speech about Ukraine and about foreign policy issues. [[03:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13920.48s)]
*  I harken back to the Reagan era. I mean, many criticisms back then in 1986 about Ronald Reagan blowing a chance to work with Mikhail Gorbachev when he walked out of the Reykjavik salt two negotiations. [[03:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13929.48s)]
*  Now, is Donald Trump going to be the next Ronald Reagan? We don't know. But Germany is going to be the next Mikhail Gorbachev. [[03:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13943.48s)]
*  I mean, like, let's get real first. You know what? No, no, no, no, Margaret, just saying. [[03:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13952.48s)]
*  Yeah, I know that was that was rhetorical. But in the end, Donald Trump, when I went to Berlin, Germany in 2017, the Berlin, the German embassy talked about how he was pulling terribly in Germany. [[03:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13958.48s)]
*  Well, I said, how George W. Bush poll. Yeah, it's about the same way. I said, wait a minute. How about Ronald Reagan? Oh, probably even worse. My comment was what statue of an American president is right across the street. [[03:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13981.48s)]
*  It's Ronald Reagan because you know what? He had a vision and Donald Trump. If he has that vision, if he executes it like Ronald Reagan did, he could be like Ronald. [[03:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=13994.48s)]
*  But coming back to this point on reciprocal tariffs, which Donald Trump said there would go into effect on April 2nd. [[03:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14005.48s)]
*  I mean, do we have a sense of whether these really will go into effect or whether this is meant to exact some sort of concession from allies and partners? [[03:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14012.48s)]
*  Brian says, I couldn't hear what you were saying, but he actually might be a better person to ask. I'll be looking at this from an observer standpoint. [[03:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14023.48s)]
*  I do think that tariffs are, of course, a way toward a negotiation. They can be used that way. If the negotiation doesn't work and they're carried out to their fullest extent, they can become something else. [[03:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14032.48s)]
*  They can become sort of entrenched and have long-term costs for people. I think we may like Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, suggested today that there could be some negotiations, some revisions towards where those tariffs actually go, whether it's a matter of reducing the rate or exempting some aspects of the economy, I think we'll see. [[03:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14046.48s)]
*  When it comes to the Ukraine, though, I will say I think if you're Zelensky, you're smart to make that entreaty before Donald Trump began speaking tonight, before President Trump began speaking. [[03:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14066.48s)]
*  But I also think you know what the limitations are of it. And when you saw Zelensky go to Europe and try to rally the European leaders, he understands even if he and the U.S. administration are able to get back on better footing than how things ended Friday, that there are still limitations. [[03:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14081.48s)]
*  There are limitations. We understand that there was likely some European input into some of the wording that we saw in President Zelensky's letter. But I do also want to talk a bit about Democrats, because, Stephanie, we saw this disruption at the beginning where Representative Green stood up and was then he was shouting something which we couldn't really understand and then was removed from the chamber. What did you think of that and that approach? [[03:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14099.48s)]
*  That was unhelpful. I think that it was as unhelpful as it was when he was standing in front of one of the federal buildings with Chuck Schumer waving his cane at that point. I mean, so but he doesn't represent the entire Democratic Party. [[03:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14127.48s)]
*  I think Senator Slotkin, who was chosen to provide the rebuttal, is the perspective that the Democratic Party wants to present. I do want to go back to this tariff thing just for a moment, is that part of the challenge, and it is a contradiction, either you are using tariffs to extract something from the other side and you're going to stick to it until you get that thing, or you're using tariffs to bring manufacturing back into the United States. [[03:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14142.48s)]
*  But when you use tariffs and then you say, oh, but they might be temporary, what business in their right mind is actually going to make the capital investment to respond to that tariff? And so you're already seeing it. [[03:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14172.48s)]
*  There has been a pullback on actual capital investments in the United States because companies are responding to kind of the chaotic economic policies that are coming out of this administration, specifically around tariffs, as well as taxes and other things. [[03:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14185.48s)]
*  And they are pulling back because it is the worst thing for a business is unpredictability. And that's what this administration is delivering for the business community. [[03:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14202.48s)]
*  I do just quickly want to come back to the Democrats before, you know, we run out of time entirely, but to follow up on it, Stephanie, I mean, where do they go from here? [[03:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14213.48s)]
*  You know what they need to do is they need to get out of Washington and get into their communities and align with the pace of the pain. Right now, what's happening in Washington hasn't percolated through the economy yet, but it will. [[03:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14223.48s)]
*  And so they need to align their message with when the American people feel the impact of these policies. When you stand in front of a town hall, you hear what hurts people and you hear the intensity with which they feel it and you hear how to speak about it. [[03:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14238.48s)]
*  Alyssa did a great job speaking about it. And right now, Republicans are on the run. They are shutting down their town halls. They don't want to hear from the American people anymore. And so it's the job of Democrats to go and lift up those voices. [[03:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14255.48s)]
*  Brian, I'm going to give you the final word before we leave this evening and the president's speech, your thoughts on where things go from here for the president. [[03:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14269.48s)]
*  Well, listen, I think he continues to accelerate. I think he looks at the first six weeks and says, you know, the speed has been lightning fast. It's decapitated the deep state and he's going to double down. At some point, some of these cases are going to be litigated and they're going to amplify what President Trump already knows, that he does have the authority to have control over the federal workforce. [[03:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14277.48s)]
*  And he's just going to continue to accelerate. I think that's what the American people want. They want to see a president working hard for them every day. They want to see a president who has ideas, who has a plan far different than the last president who had no ideas and was asleep half the time. I think he's just going to show his energy. [[03:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14296.48s)]
*  Rodney, Brian kindly left you 20 seconds as well. [[03:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14310.48s)]
*  Shoot, I'm going to blow it by thinking about what I want to say. But the bottom line is, look, Democrats are in disarray right now. We saw numerous Democrats walk out after Al Green did his show. I hope they're all named because I remember a day when Joe Wilson was excoriated the next day when he stood up and told President Obama, you lie. [[03:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14313.48s)]
*  So much so later on, I joked, I was sitting behind him one state of the union. I said, I'm here for a purpose to hold you down. But the bottom line is this, you know, we can agree or disagree on economic policy. But the bottom line is Democrats, if they want to help middle American small businesses, they got to provide tax certainty. [[03:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14333.48s)]
*  I don't think they're there yet. [[03:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14350.48s)]
*  And that has to be the final word because we pretty much run out of time. [[03:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14351.48s)]
*  But thank you to our viewers for watching our special coverage of President Trump's address to the joint sessions of Congress. We have much more on our website. Stay with us. [[03:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14354.48s)]
*  Hello, some of the variations we've seen in our weather over the last couple of days are going to continue during Wednesday with the best of the warm spring sunshine to be found across England and Wales. Further north, parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland seeing more clouds. [[03:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14363.48s)]
*  Some patchy rain will stay quite windy here in association with close to the north of the UK, a lot of ice bars on the charts. So it will be windy, whereas high pressure continues to hold on down towards the south. [[03:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14384.48s)]
*  So early morning fog patches giving way to a lot of sunshine through southern England, Wales, the Midlands, East Anglia, sunny skies across much of northern England as cloud tends to break. [[03:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14397.48s)]
*  But more cloud will linger across parts of Northern Ireland, especially the western and northern parts of Scotland with some splashes of rain. [[04:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14407.48s)]
*  It stays quite windy here as well. [[04:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14414.48s)]
*  Guts of 50 or 60 miles per hour in exposed spots, but with some shelter. [[04:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14415.48s)]
*  Parts of North East Scotland could get to 15 degrees best of the sunshine further south, also lifting temperatures to 14 or 15. [[04:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14419.48s)]
*  As we go through Wednesday night, we do keep a fair bit of cloud across the northwest of the UK. [[04:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14438.48s)]
*  Still some outbreaks of rain at times. Further south, some clear spells. Not quite as cold as some recent nights. [[04:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14442.48s)]
*  Temperatures in many spots are likely to stay just above freezing, probably not as much fog either, with more of a breeze. [[04:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14450.48s)]
*  And that breeze coming up from the south, so still bringing some very mild air. [[04:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14456.48s)]
*  This frontal system trying to squeeze its way in from the west, that will bring more cloud across western areas. [[04:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14460.48s)]
*  We may just see a few showers creeping eastwards, say across Northern Ireland into western Scotland, Wales, the southwest as we go through into Thursday afternoon. [[04:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14466.48s)]
*  Sunny skies further east, highs of 15 or 16 degrees. Check how high the temperatures will go where you are by having a look at the BBC Weather app. [[04:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14475.48s)]
*  Now by Friday, I think we will see more cloud. Some outbreaks of showery rain moving erratically eastwards and northwards. [[04:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14483.48s)]
*  Again though, any sunshine making it feel mild, even warm, highs of around 15 or 16 degrees. [[04:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14490.48s)]
*  Now low pressure takes a little bit more control of our weather as we head into the weekend. [[04:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14497.48s)]
*  We will see some frontal systems circulating around the low, so a little bit of rain at times. [[04:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14502.48s)]
*  But actually, we should keep hold of a decent amount of dry weather and in any sunshine it will still feel fairly warm. [[04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14507.48s)]
*  We're going to start with what's happening when it comes to climate change. [[04:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14521.48s)]
*  We cannot normalize this. This is going to appeal to more people than just his base. [[04:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14525.48s)]
*  And that's really the nub of this. The hard part comes next. That gift of pan-diplomacy. [[04:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14531.48s)]
*  But this is the first time we've done this in modern history. And we're going to say unprecedented, a lot, a lot, a lot. [[04:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14536.48s)]
*  The news is just words without the context. And this is the context. [[04:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14542.48s)]
*  Tonight from 8 on BBC News and iPlayer. [[04:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14547.48s)]
*  This program asks plain questions with the help of the unrivaled range of BBC journalists right across the world. [[04:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14552.48s)]
*  And gathered here in this building, I'll also draw my front-line experience that helps me know who to talk to and who to listen to. [[04:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14561.48s)]
*  Meaning our analysis is unbiased with absolutely no spin. [[04:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14570.48s)]
*  That's why we call our program Unspun World. [[04:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14575.48s)]
*  Live from London, this is BBC News. [[04:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14605.48s)]
*  President Trump addresses the US Congress telling politicians America is on the brink of an unprecedented comeback. [[04:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14622.48s)]
*  To my fellow citizens, America is back. [[04:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14630.48s)]
*  In a wide-ranging speech, the president promised a crackdown on migration, a new set of trade tariffs, and he had this to say on the war in Ukraine. [[04:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14637.48s)]
*  Earlier today I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[04:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14646.48s)]
*  The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. [[04:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14652.48s)]
*  I'm Helena Humphrey in Washington, DC, where Donald Trump has told Congress he's just getting started meeting resistance from Democrats in the chamber. [[04:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14663.48s)]
*  Hello and a very warm welcome to the program. [[04:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14682.48s)]
*  I'm Sally Bundock. [[04:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14685.48s)]
*  Well, our focus is on Washington, DC, where it's been declared America is back. [[04:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14687.48s)]
*  The bold statement by President Trump as he addressed a joint session of the United States Congress for the first time since he returned to the White House. [[04:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14693.48s)]
*  In a speech which was the longest a president has ever given to Congress, Donald Trump said America was on the brink of an unprecedented comeback as he lauded the bold actions his administration has made during his six weeks in office. [[04:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14703.48s)]
*  Praised was heaped on Elon Musk as the president thanked him for saving hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud through his Department of Government Efficiency. [[04:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14719.48s)]
*  On trade, he confirmed from next month, reciprocal trade tariffs will come into force against several nations. [[04:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14728.48s)]
*  The president also announced a crackdown on criminal gangs and immigrants promising what he called the largest deportation in American history. [[04:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14734.48s)]
*  And just days after their now infamous bust up in the Oval Office, President Trump said he'd received a letter from President Zelensky saying the Ukrainian leader is ready for talks with Russia to try and bring an end to the three-day war. [[04:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14743.48s)]
*  He also said that the Russian leader is ready to take on the Russian-U.S. conflict and signaled Moscow was ready to make peace. [[04:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14758.48s)]
*  Well, right off the bat, President Trump made this bold statement to both houses of Congress. [[04:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14765.48s)]
*  Members of the United States Congress, thank you very much. [[04:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14772.48s)]
*  And to my fellow citizens, America is back. [[04:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14778.48s)]
*  President Trump said his administration had saved millions of dollars in waste already, which he said was down to the work of Doge and their boss, Elon Musk. [[04:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14788.48s)]
*  And to that end, I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. [[04:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14798.48s)]
*  Perhaps you've heard of it. [[04:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14805.48s)]
*  Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. [[04:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14815.48s)]
*  Thank you, Elon. He's working very hard. He didn't need this. He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. [[04:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14840.48s)]
*  On trade, the president defended his decision to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, as well as making this announcement. [[04:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14848.48s)]
*  April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in. And whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal, back and forth. [[04:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14857.48s)]
*  Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. [[04:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14869.48s)]
*  And on the war in Ukraine, President Trump said he had received a letter from President Zelensky just days after their explosive row in the Oval Office. [[04:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14888.48s)]
*  Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[04:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14898.48s)]
*  The letter reads, Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. [[04:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14904.48s)]
*  Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians, he said. [[04:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14912.48s)]
*  My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. [[04:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14916.48s)]
*  We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. [[04:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14924.48s)]
*  Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you. [[04:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14931.48s)]
*  I appreciate that he sent this letter just a little while ago. [[04:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14940.48s)]
*  Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. [[04:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14945.48s)]
*  Wouldn't that be beautiful? [[04:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14953.48s)]
*  Let's go live to Capitol Hill now and our correspondent there, Helena Humphrey, who was watching that speech that lasted more than 100 minutes. [[04:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14958.48s)]
*  That in itself makes history. [[04:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14966.48s)]
*  It certainly does. That longest of the joint addresses to Congress there in history. [[04:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14970.48s)]
*  Donald Trump essentially taking to the stage, taking a victory lap, I think it's fair to say. [[04:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14976.48s)]
*  This isn't strictly speaking a State of the Union speech, but nevertheless, [[04:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14982.48s)]
*  Donald Trump certainly used it as an opportunity to tout what he saw as a long list of achievements in those at times frenetic six weeks back in the White House. [[04:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14986.48s)]
*  He came on to that podium saying America is back. [[04:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=14997.48s)]
*  He then started by touching on some of those well-worn themes that we had heard on the campaign trail when it comes to culture war issues, [[04:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15002.48s)]
*  for example, saying that he had ended diversity, equity and inclusion programs, not just he said in the government, [[04:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15009.48s)]
*  but with it also now spreading to the private sector. [[04:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15016.48s)]
*  He then referenced the work of the Department of Governmental Efficiency, that initiative, of course, headed by the unelected billionaire, [[04:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15020.48s)]
*  Elon Musk, who was there in the audience, who stood up and was applauded by Republican lawmakers there in the chamber, [[04:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15029.48s)]
*  who said for any of those federal workers who had been mandated to return to the office and did not do so, they could stand to lose their jobs. [[04:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15036.48s)]
*  Worth pointing out that Democrats had also invited in the audience some of those tens of thousands of federal employees who we know have already been laid off through that initiative. [[04:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15045.48s)]
*  And then, of course, one of the really important points to watch for, I think, for many Americans, of course, had been the economy. [[04:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15056.48s)]
*  According to recent CBS polling, that remains the number one issue for Americans, regardless of their political stripe. [[04:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15063.48s)]
*  Donald Trump said that after years of a cost of living crisis in this country, he would make America great again. [[04:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15070.48s)]
*  But, of course, it's worth keeping in mind the context to all of this. [[04:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15077.48s)]
*  On Tuesday, Donald Trump did go ahead with those promised tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and we did see volatility on the financial markets. [[04:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15080.48s)]
*  He paid a little lip service to that, saying that we saw a little disruption, but saying essentially that he believed it would be worth it, [[04:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15090.48s)]
*  and then promising on the 2nd of April to bring in further reciprocal tariffs, saying whatever they tax us, we will tax them back. [[04:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15098.48s)]
*  Immigration, of course, another key theme saying that we are getting people out and we are getting them out fast, is what he said. [[04:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15107.48s)]
*  And, of course, foreign policy. I think the eyes of the world were on that, not just with regards to Gaza, but crucially right now, Ukraine, [[04:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15115.48s)]
*  and referencing that letter from President Zelensky saying that they were ready for a peace deal as soon as possible. [[04:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15123.48s)]
*  Worth pointing out, President Zelensky had said earlier in the deal that they were looking at a limited truce. [[04:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15131.48s)]
*  And wrapping all of this up, coming back to this theme that we've seen on the campaign trail, [[04:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15137.48s)]
*  Donald Trump saying that he believed that he was saved in Butler, Pennsylvania in July during that assassination attempt as some kind of act of divine intervention, [[04:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15141.48s)]
*  that essentially that is his mandate to make America great again. [[04:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15152.48s)]
*  And, as ever, it was very clear the divide in Congress, as you watched his speech, you could see the Democrats not clapping very much, not standing up, [[04:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15156.48s)]
*  some of them holding up banners and actually one had to be removed. Talk us through some of that disruption. [[04:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15166.48s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, we could see that resistance from the outset. [[04:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15173.48s)]
*  Democrats, for example, holding signs saying Elon Steals with reference to Elon Musk and what they perceived to be going on through the Doge Department. [[04:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15178.48s)]
*  Another Democratic lawmaker just holding up a sign when Donald Trump walked in saying, this is not normal. [[04:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15189.48s)]
*  And then we saw that moment barely minutes into that address when the Democratic lawmaker Al Green of Texas was removed from the chamber. [[04:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15195.48s)]
*  There seemed to have been some kind of interruption with Representative Green saying that you have no mandate to cut Medicaid that is over perceived risks of Social Security programs, [[04:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15204.48s)]
*  for example, health insurance programs for working Americans being cut in this next budget. [[04:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15218.48s)]
*  We wait to see whether that will happen. But certainly some disruption, I think it's fair to say, on the floor. [[04:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15224.48s)]
*  Some Democratic lawmakers walking out. Of course, then we had the Democratic rebuttal coming from Alyssa Slotkin, a freshman senator of Michigan. [[04:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15229.48s)]
*  She made more of a call for unity. I think it's fair to say her message also started off with an economic one. [[04:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15238.48s)]
*  She said the president talks big when it comes to the economy. But read the fine print, she said, for middle class Americans, for hardworking families. [[04:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15245.48s)]
*  She said he will offer tax cuts and breaks for wealthy Americans, not necessary things that will filter down to you. [[04:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15254.48s)]
*  She said the American dream is one in which people can work in an auto plant and afford the car that they are making. [[04:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15261.48s)]
*  And she said that is the Democratic vision going forward. And then she went back to this theme of democracy that we know Democrats have recently evoked, [[04:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15268.48s)]
*  saying, as someone who had formerly worked with the CIA, I know what it's like, she said, to see democracies flicker. [[04:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15276.48s)]
*  She said she doesn't want to see this here in the United States. And in that regard, she called on citizens to be engaged, to organize and essentially to resist. [[04:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15284.48s)]
*  Helena, thank you so much. Helena Humphrey there at Capitol Hill for us with an upsum of that speech. [[04:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15294.48s)]
*  Let's now discuss this with Julia Manchester, who's political reporter at The Hill. [[04:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15301.48s)]
*  Julia, what did you make of this speech? There was an awful lot in it. [[04:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15306.48s)]
*  Also, we have to mention the gallery that was packed with various people, including we've seen Elon Musk and the First Lady, of course, [[04:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15311.48s)]
*  but various other key people in there that he referred to to really underline and accentuate some of his key points. [[04:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15320.48s)]
*  Well, look, it seemed a lot like a campaign speech in many ways. [[04:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15328.48s)]
*  The president repeating a lot of his lines that he used during the campaign to attack now former President Biden, for example, [[04:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15332.48s)]
*  He folded Democrats repeatedly for not cheering for his accomplishments. [[04:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15342.48s)]
*  So it was certainly partisan in that nature. And also Democrats also showed a lot of signs of partisanship as well. [[04:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15347.48s)]
*  Of course, you got Congressman Al Green standing up and yelling at President Trump about potentially cutting Medicaid, shaking his cane. [[04:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15356.48s)]
*  For the first time, I believe, actually, in American history, you saw a lawmaker escorted from the House chamber for interrupting a joint session or State of the Union address. [[04:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15365.48s)]
*  So that was quite something to watch. You also had a number of Democratic lawmakers holding up signs, essentially saying to resist or bashing Elon Musk. [[04:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15377.48s)]
*  So this was incredibly partisan, incredibly political. [[04:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15386.48s)]
*  And I think it's probably more so than past State of the Union's we have seen in recent history. [[04:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15389.48s)]
*  Now, you know, the president touched on a number of various issues like foreign policy. [[04:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15396.48s)]
*  But Democrats that I've talked to seem to be complaining that he didn't talk about the economy. [[04:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15402.48s)]
*  And that seems to be a growing issue for the president now that we are continuing to see inflation in this country and these tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China have been enacted this week. [[04:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15408.48s)]
*  Yeah, I was just going to ask you about that, because, of course, this speech was was very late. [[04:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15420.48s)]
*  And that's because it's been across America on prime time television. [[04:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15425.48s)]
*  And so he's very much got that audience in mind, I assume the domestic audience. [[04:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15430.48s)]
*  And for them was the most important issue, the money in their pockets. [[04:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15435.48s)]
*  Absolutely. Look, the president will tout the work he's done on immigration and, you know, his words securing the southern border. [[04:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15440.48s)]
*  Yes, that absolutely was a top campaign issue. [[04:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15449.48s)]
*  But I would say that even the economy trumps that as a top issue for voters. [[04:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15452.48s)]
*  And there are some troubling signs for President Trump when it comes to the economy. [[04:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15457.48s)]
*  There was a recent NPR Nick Maris poll that was released on Tuesday that found that 46 percent of Americans believe Donald Trump is handling the economy for the worst, while 42 percent said they believed he was handling it for the better. [[04:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15461.48s)]
*  You've seen the stock market react negatively to these tariffs. [[04:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15476.48s)]
*  And I think there are some concerns about how these tariffs are going to impact prices and just the economy in general. [[04:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15480.48s)]
*  This country and I'm sure a lot of Republicans in the chamber, even though they were cheering him every possible chance they could, they were listening for his messaging on that issue, because in two years, these Republicans, all of them in the House of Representatives and some of them in the Senate will be up for re-election. [[04:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15487.48s)]
*  And Democrats have already begun to hammer them on the economy, something that Republicans mastered in terms of messaging during the last election. [[04:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15505.48s)]
*  He did, though, say that tax cuts for the majority will be coming swiftly, appealing to the Democrats to approve that to go through. [[04:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15515.48s)]
*  Of course, here in Europe, all eyes will be on any mention of Ukraine foreign policy. [[04:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15525.48s)]
*  What did you make of what he had to say about that, that he'd had a letter from President Zelensky today, yesterday, of course, in the U.S., and that he said that Moscow is ready for peace? [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15531.48s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15543.48s)]
*  I'm sure on the letter to Ukraine, that was definitely appeasing to a number of Republicans. [[04:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15545.48s)]
*  Remember, there is a split in the Republican Party as to how they view Ukraine. [[04:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15551.48s)]
*  You have a lot of Ukraine hawks within the GOP who would like, you know, just nothing more than to see Putin defeated, to see Russia defeated. [[04:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15555.48s)]
*  And then you have another wing of the party that would like this America First approach, to have this hands-off approach to this conflict. [[04:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15565.48s)]
*  And I think him talking about that letter from Zelensky certainly appeased more of the hawkish members of the party on the issue of Ukraine. [[04:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15572.48s)]
*  So he didn't offer a ton of detail. [[04:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15582.48s)]
*  I think there still are a lot of questions going forward as to what that deal looks like. [[04:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15585.48s)]
*  But following that Oval Office meeting and following news that the U.S. had halted aid to Ukraine, you had a lot of Republicans in the Senate voicing concerns about a lack of U.S. support for Ukraine. [[04:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15590.48s)]
*  So I think that certainly appeased them in some way tonight. [[04:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15604.48s)]
*  Julia Manchester, thank you for your time from The Hill. We do appreciate it. [[04:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15609.48s)]
*  We have a live page on the BBC News website and BBC News app outlining all the key points in that very long speech. [[04:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15613.48s)]
*  As we've mentioned, he did announce on the 2nd of April, reciprocal tariffs will begin. [[04:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15623.48s)]
*  We will be discussing that in detail in business in just over 10 minutes time around the world and across the UK. [[04:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15630.48s)]
*  This is BBC News. [[04:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15637.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15667.48s)]
*  Now, thousands of delegates are gathering in Beijing to take part in China's annual parliamentary session. [[04:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15697.48s)]
*  China's National People's Congress is expected to mostly focus on the economy. [[04:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15712.48s)]
*  It comes amid an escalating trade war with the U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. [[04:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15717.48s)]
*  The Chinese announced TIT for tariffs on American agricultural imports in response to the new 10% increase on tariffs on Chinese imports that came into effect yesterday. [[04:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15723.48s)]
*  So this is on top of the 10% levy that Washington hit Beijing with in February. [[04:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15736.48s)]
*  Our China correspondent, Stephen McDonnell, sent this update from Beijing. [[04:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15743.48s)]
*  We're here at the Great Hall of the People for this country's annual political spectacle. [[04:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15753.48s)]
*  Although it's a rather stamp session essentially approving what I've already decided, the numbers matter and people are trying to see from the government work report if there's to be any shift in economic policy. [[04:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15759.48s)]
*  GDP, for example, still to be around 5% and that's despite the threat of a looming trade war with the U.S. [[04:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15775.48s)]
*  We have seen some measures here to try to increase spending from ordinary Chinese families. [[04:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15783.48s)]
*  You see, if people are worried about the economy here, they're going to keep saving rather than buying more things and the government wants more consumption. [[04:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15790.48s)]
*  So there have been a few incentives to replace your old car with a new one, to replace your old appliance with a new one. [[04:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15798.48s)]
*  But economists would say, though, that perhaps not enough by way of propping up the social safety net because in the long run that's what's needed to give people the security they would require to buy more things. [[04:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15806.48s)]
*  Over the coming days, we might see Xi Jinping speaking at one of the several smaller meetings and he could refer to say China-U.S. relations or even the threat of tariffs from the U.S. [[04:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15820.48s)]
*  The foreign ministers press briefing is another opportunity for the Chinese government to talk about tensions with the Trump administration and the unknown world we seem to be heading into. [[04:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15833.48s)]
*  But for a domestic audience, what Chinese people will be looking for is over the coming days, around about a week, what more might emerge by way of the government's plans to steer this country out of the rough economic waters that it's in right now because there still are major economic headaches in China and ordinary people, they want some answers. [[04:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15846.48s)]
*  And we'll have more on that too in business. But first this in his first wide ranging interview since leaving Downing Street, the former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says he regrets ever saying stop the boats. [[04:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15870.48s)]
*  He told Nick Robinson the statement was too stark and too binary and concedes it couldn't actually be delivered. [[04:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15884.48s)]
*  This is just one of the lessons from Downing Street he shared with the Political Thinking podcast. [[04:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15892.48s)]
*  I will do whatever it takes to stop the boats and stop the boats. [[04:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15898.48s)]
*  There's one phrase, one slogan, one promise associated with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak more than any other. It is stop the boats. [[04:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15904.48s)]
*  Yet in his first wide ranging interview since leaving Downing Street eight months ago, the former Prime Minister tells me he regrets ever saying it. [[04:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15913.48s)]
*  Wasn't it mad to promise something that you were never going to be able to do? There's not a government in the world that has closed down a border. [[04:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15923.48s)]
*  I think illegal migration is many things, but it's fundamentally not fair. I think it's not fair to British taxpayers having to fund this huge bill. [[04:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15930.48s)]
*  It's not fair to legal migrants who, you know, we believe in waiting your turn being in a queue and these people are not doing that. [[04:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15941.48s)]
*  You asked about this phrase and I think that is fair. I think actually that's a fair point. [[04:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15952.48s)]
*  And if I reflect back on it, I think the language used in those five priorities, particularly on that one, the way it was communicated wasn't quite right. [[04:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15960.48s)]
*  Sunak told me that being Prime Minister was a lonely job, perhaps never more so than when he confronted the rage of veterans after leaving D-Day commemorations early to get back on the election campaign trail, even as other world leaders stayed behind. [[04:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15973.48s)]
*  The question people mind is, what was he thinking? How did it happen? [[04:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15990.48s)]
*  I don't mind apologising again because it was a genuine mistake and I deeply regret it. I did not for one second sit there and say, let me actually decide to leave this early knowing what I'm missing. [[04:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=15993.48s)]
*  I didn't know that that was happening. [[04:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16007.48s)]
*  I'm sure it's horrifying to you that people think that you might. [[04:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16009.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's horrifying. You know, it was very sad and actually it was upsetting. [[04:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16011.48s)]
*  We're here to deliver for the people. [[04:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16016.48s)]
*  Sunak's time in Downing Street began as Boris Johnson's Chancellor during the Covid pandemic. [[04:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16018.48s)]
*  He tells me about their fundamental disagreements about the way to handle the economy and what he calls the fear narrative that lay behind so much of the messaging around lockdown. [[04:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16024.48s)]
*  He's often said, follow the science. It wasn't a very helpful phrase, was it? Because the truth is there was no science for this pandemic. [[04:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16036.48s)]
*  I think we could have been more open about saying, look, even the scientists themselves are not united on this or they don't 100% know that this is the right thing to do. [[04:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16044.48s)]
*  But this is what they're suggesting and this is what we're going to do. [[04:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16053.48s)]
*  Treat people as grownups? [[04:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16057.48s)]
*  Yes. [[04:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16058.48s)]
*  History will remember Sunak not just as the youngest Prime Minister in two centuries, but as Britain's first Asian Prime Minister, the grandson of poor Indian immigrants. [[04:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16060.48s)]
*  Some have recently questioned whether a man whose brown and Hindu can call himself English at all, a question he regards as outrageous. [[04:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16071.48s)]
*  I mean, of course I'm English. [[04:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16082.48s)]
*  Born here, brought up here. [[04:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16084.48s)]
*  Yeah, of course I'm English. [[04:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16087.48s)]
*  Look at the composition of our England cricket team, England football team on this definition. [[04:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16090.48s)]
*  You can't be English even playing for England, let alone supporting them. [[04:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16095.48s)]
*  So I think the whole, yeah, I found the whole thing slightly ridiculous. [[04:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16099.48s)]
*  From the moment he called the election in the driving rain to the moment the results showed the worst Tory defeat ever, Rishi Sunak has much he wants to forget. [[04:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16102.48s)]
*  However, he hopes we'll remember that after the political and economic chaos of Johnson and Truss, one thing he did bring was stability. [[04:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16113.48s)]

*  Stay with us here on BBC News. [[04:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16138.48s)]
*  We're going to have more on that speech to Congress by President Trump, where he very boldly said, I am just getting started. [[04:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16141.48s)]
*  He made many announcements, including the news that on the 2nd of April, reciprocal tariffs will begin. [[04:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16152.48s)]
*  We'll be unpacking what that means for the US and the global economy next. [[04:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16160.48s)]
*  Hello. [[04:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16165.48s)]
*  Some of the variations we've seen in our weather over the last couple of days are going to continue during Wednesday with the best of the warm spring sunshine to be found across England and Wales. [[04:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16171.48s)]
*  Further north, parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, seeing more clouds, some patchy rain will stay quite windy here in association with this frontal system squeezing its way close to the north of the UK. [[04:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16182.48s)]
*  A lot of ice bars on the chart, so it will be windy, whereas high pressure continues to hold on down towards the south. [[04:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16194.48s)]
*  So early morning fog patches giving way to a lot of sunshine through southern England, Wales, the Midlands, East Anglia, sunny skies across much of northern England as cloud tends to break. [[04:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16201.48s)]
*  But more cloud will linger across parts of Northern Ireland, especially the western and northern parts of Scotland with some splashes of rain. [[04:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16211.48s)]
*  It stays quite windy here as well. Guts of 50 or 60 mph in exposed spots, but with some shelter from the wind, parts of northeast Scotland could get to 15 degrees best of the sunshine further south, also lifting temperatures to 14 or 15 degrees Celsius. [[04:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16218.48s)]
*  As we go through Wednesday night to keep a fair bit of cloud across the northwest of the UK, still some outbreaks of rain at times. [[04:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16232.48s)]
*  Further south, some clear spells, not quite as cold as some recent nights. [[04:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16239.48s)]
*  Temperatures in many spots are likely to stay just above freezing, probably not as much fog either, with more of a breeze. [[04:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16244.48s)]
*  And that breeze coming up from the south, so still bringing some very mild air. [[04:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16251.48s)]
*  This frontal system trying to squeeze its way in from the west, that will bring more cloud across western areas. [[04:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16254.48s)]
*  We may just see a few showers creeping eastwards, say across northern Ireland into western Scotland, Wales, the southwest as we go through into Thursday afternoon. [[04:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16260.48s)]
*  Sunny skies further east, highs of 15 or 16 degrees. [[04:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16269.48s)]
*  Check how high the temperatures will go where you are by having a look at the BBC Weather app. [[04:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16273.48s)]
*  Now by Friday, I think we will see more cloud, some outbreaks of showery rain moving erratically eastwards and northwards. [[04:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16278.48s)]
*  Again though, any sunshine making it feel mild, even warm, highs of around 15 or 16 degrees. [[04:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16285.48s)]
*  Now low pressure for all of our weather as we head into the weekend. [[04:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16292.48s)]
*  We will see some frontal systems circulating around the low, so a little bit of rain at times, but actually we should keep hold of a decent amount of dry weather. [[04:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16295.48s)]
*  And in any sunshine it will still feel fairly warm. [[04:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16303.48s)]
*  Today we're looking at the state of British politics. [[04:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16314.48s)]

*  Trump also promised to get inflation under control. [[04:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16515.48s)]
*  The most recent data in January showing is currently at around 3 percent. [[04:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16518.48s)]
*  That's still higher, of course, than the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. [[04:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16522.48s)]
*  The US president believes lower energy prices will help to achieve to bring down inflation. [[04:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16527.48s)]
*  He also insisted there would be tax cuts for everybody [[04:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16533.48s)]
*  and urged the Democrats to vote through proposed changes. [[04:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16537.48s)]
*  But with the global trade war currently dominating headlines, [[04:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16540.48s)]
*  Trump appeared keen to double down. [[04:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16543.48s)]
*  April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in. [[04:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16546.48s)]
*  And whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. [[04:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16550.48s)]
*  That's reciprocal, back and forth. [[04:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16556.48s)]
*  Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. [[04:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16558.48s)]
*  If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do... [[04:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16562.48s)]
*  As the president has often said, tariffs is a beautiful word. [[04:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16573.48s)]
*  Well, interestingly, the US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Tuesday [[04:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16577.48s)]
*  before the president delivered his speech that he was confident a compromise could be found with Mexico and Canada soon. [[04:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16585.48s)]
*  He's going to come out today angry that Americans are still being killed. [[04:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16593.48s)]
*  Now, both the Mexicans and the Canadians were on the phone with me all day today [[04:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16598.48s)]
*  trying to show that they'll do better. [[04:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16602.48s)]
*  And the president's listening because you know he's very, very fair and very reasonable. [[04:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16604.48s)]
*  So I think he's going to work something out with them. [[04:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16608.48s)]
*  It's not going to be a pause, none of that pause stuff. [[04:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16611.48s)]
*  But I think he's going to figure out, you do more and I'll meet you in the middle some way. [[04:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16614.48s)]
*  And we're going to probably be announcing that tomorrow. [[04:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16618.48s)]
*  Well, let's talk to Kyle Handley, associate professor of economics at University of California San Diego. [[04:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16621.48s)]
*  Welcome to BBC News. [[04:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16628.48s)]
*  First of all, overall, when it comes to the economy, what did you make of the president's speech? [[04:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16630.48s)]
*  I think he's definitely doubling down on his strategy from his first term. [[04:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16637.48s)]
*  He's trying to maximize all the leverage he can get with executive action. [[04:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16642.48s)]
*  Congress takes a lot of time to get things done. [[04:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16647.48s)]
*  And I think he reinforced tonight all the things he's already tried to do through executive orders. [[04:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16650.48s)]
*  And he even revealed some executive orders during the speech. [[04:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16656.48s)]
*  And when it comes to tariffs, he can just crack on with that. [[04:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16660.48s)]
*  And he is doing so. [[04:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16663.48s)]
*  But when it comes to reducing taxation and spending, that's where he needs the support of Congress, isn't it? [[04:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16665.48s)]
*  And that was the appeal, do you think? [[04:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16673.48s)]
*  Definitely. [[04:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16675.48s)]
*  I think he looked over his shoulder a few times and called out to people in the audience, members of Congress, and said, [[04:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16676.48s)]
*  I want you to get this done, different spending bills to do things he wants, new things he wants done, [[04:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16683.48s)]
*  and also asked them to go along with him on various tax reform and tax cut packages as well. [[04:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16690.48s)]
*  When you look at the Democratic Party's official response to his speech, [[04:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16697.48s)]
*  they pick out their points on the economy. [[04:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16702.48s)]
*  Grocery and home prices are going up, they say, not down. [[04:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16704.48s)]
*  He hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either of those. [[04:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16707.48s)]
*  His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber and cars, and will hit manufacturers and farmers. [[04:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16712.48s)]
*  What's your take on his economic plans? [[04:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16721.48s)]
*  There is so much commentary right now on what's going to happen in the near future to the U.S. economy. [[04:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16725.48s)]
*  So the tariffs that went into place today on Canada and Mexico, I think, will absolutely raise prices for the consumers of goods. [[04:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16730.48s)]
*  From Canada, from Mexico, we also increased tariffs on China. [[04:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16742.48s)]
*  The people that buy those goods, and some of them are businesses, and some of them are folks that are going to go to the grocery store next week, [[04:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16747.48s)]
*  and the next batch of avocados is going to be there, and it will be more expensive. [[04:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16755.48s)]
*  Trump said today that he thinks these are just going to be disturbances and they'll be adjustments, [[04:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16759.48s)]
*  but the adjustments are just so massive that there's no way they're going to take place in a matter of days or weeks. [[04:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16766.48s)]
*  If he wants the kind of industry to come back to the United States and build things behind the tariff wall that he's creating, [[04:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16773.48s)]
*  that is going to take years and cost a large amount of money, and that money's got to come from somewhere, [[04:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16782.48s)]
*  and it could come out of people's wages, it could come out of profits, it could come out of the higher prices that people are going to pay for goods. [[04:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16789.48s)]
*  And do you think that will pose a problem to him in the run-up to the midterms because Americans will be feeling more pain than gain? [[04:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16796.48s)]
*  Yes, I mean, we've absolutely seen this before during the COVID-19 pandemic, during the Biden administration. [[04:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16805.48s)]
*  If people show up at Walmart and Target and retail outlets and grocery stores and they see prices are going up again, they will be upset. [[04:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16812.48s)]
*  I am certain of that. [[04:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16821.48s)]
*  Okay. Kyle Handley, we appreciate your thoughts and reaction to that speech. [[04:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16823.48s)]
*  And on that subject, let's take a look then at two of America's biggest retailers, Target, as you just heard there, but also Best Buy. [[04:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16829.48s)]
*  They are both warning shoppers that they'll face higher prices as a direct result of the latest tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed on China, Mexico and Canada. [[04:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16838.48s)]
*  Our North America business correspondent, Michelle Fleury, has more from New York. [[04:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16849.48s)]
*  Some unwelcome news on the tariff front. [[04:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16854.48s)]
*  Grocery bills may start to go up in the coming days. [[04:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16858.48s)]
*  That was the warning from Brian Cornell. [[04:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16861.48s)]
*  He's the boss of Target. [[04:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16863.48s)]
*  Now, the retail giant, which depends on fresh produce from Mexico during the winter months, said that 25 percent tariffs implemented by the U.S. [[04:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16865.48s)]
*  on Mexican imports will force it to raise prices on items such as strawberries, bananas and avocados. [[04:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16873.48s)]
*  Perhaps as soon as this week, he told CNBC. [[04:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16880.48s)]
*  Another business also feeling the shock of tariffs is Best Buy. [[04:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16883.48s)]
*  The boss of the electronics chain, Cory Barry, said U.S. [[04:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16887.48s)]
*  consumers are likely to face higher prices as its vendors try to pass along some of the tariff costs. [[04:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16891.48s)]
*  Now, work is tricky because it depends on the extent to which the extra costs are passed on by the importers and also how behavior changes. [[04:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16897.48s)]
*  On the bright side, though, Chipotle customers shouldn't notice any change. [[04:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16907.48s)]
*  The fast food chain said it intended to absorb the costs for now. [[04:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16911.48s)]
*  Michelle Fleury there. [[04:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16915.48s)]
*  Let's bring you some other business stories. [[04:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16917.48s)]
*  American alcohol has been pulled off shelves in the Canadian province of Ontario, which is the country's largest province by population. [[04:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16919.48s)]
*  Its leader, Doug Ford, said he is willing to go further if the tariffs are not removed, [[04:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16928.48s)]
*  including cutting electricity supply to the U.S. as a last measure. [[04:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16933.48s)]
*  Ford also raised the possibility of slapping a 25 percent export tariff on electricity that Ontario spends, sorry, [[04:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16937.48s)]
*  sends to 1.5 million homes in Minnesota, Michigan and New York. [[04:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16944.48s)]
*  Apple is taking legal action to try to overturn a demand made by the UK government to view its customers' private data [[04:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16950.48s)]
*  if required. [[04:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16958.48s)]
*  U.S. tech giants appealed to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, that's an independent court, [[04:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16959.48s)]
*  with the power to investigate claims against the security service. [[04:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16964.48s)]
*  It is the latest development in an unprecedented row between one of the world's biggest tech firms and the UK government over data privacy. [[04:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16968.48s)]
*  The UK Treasury has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments. [[04:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16976.48s)]
*  Amid expectations, the Chancellor's Room for Maneuver has all been wiped out. [[04:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16984.48s)]
*  The Department will put the proposed cuts to the Office of Budget Responsibility, the official forecaster on Wednesday, [[04:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16989.48s)]
*  ahead of the spring statement, which comes later this month. [[04:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16995.48s)]
*  Sources say it's evident that the world has changed since the budget last October when the OBR indicated [[04:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=16999.48s)]
*  the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had almost 10 billion pounds in headroom against her self-imposed borrowing targets. [[04:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17006.48s)]
*  Now it's proving to be another rollercoaster week for financial markets. [[04:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17013.48s)]
*  In the U.S., the S&P 500 closed at its lowest level since November, [[04:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17019.48s)]
*  as jitters remain on Wall Street about tariffs and the impact they will have on the U.S. economy. [[04:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17024.48s)]
*  The new tariffs started on Tuesday on Canada, China and Mexico. [[04:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17031.48s)]
*  The S&P 500 at the end of the day was down 1.2%, the Dow Jones was down 1.5%, the Nasdaq wasn't so bad, down by 0.3%. [[04:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17036.48s)]
*  American retailers and carmakers were among hardest hit. With this, the trade war could last for many months. [[04:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17046.48s)]
*  Let's unpack this with Gervais Williams, head of equities at Premier Miten. [[04:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17055.48s)]
*  Good morning to you, Gervais. [[04:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17060.48s)]
*  It's interesting to see how markets were going to be on Tuesday. [[04:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17062.48s)]
*  Of course, they sunk significantly on Monday in the U.S. We saw declines in Asia and Europe as well. [[04:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17067.48s)]
*  Yes, it's been interesting really. [[04:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17073.48s)]
*  The year started with the U.S. market actually being relatively, not appreciating, slightly lower. [[04:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17075.48s)]
*  But actually we've seen other markets continuing to appreciate, particularly in Europe. [[04:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17082.48s)]
*  And I think there's a pattern change going on. [[04:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17086.48s)]
*  I think Trump is bringing in a lot of open-ended uncertainties. [[04:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17088.48s)]
*  And so we've seen a skew towards companies which generate good and growing income. [[04:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17091.48s)]
*  That's happening in the U.S. with some of the utility companies coming up. [[04:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17095.48s)]
*  But it's particularly evident in other world markets where they have a much larger weighting of these good and growing income stocks. [[04:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17098.48s)]
*  Interesting though to look at futures that indicate we might see a bit of an uptick on Wall Street today [[04:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17105.48s)]
*  following the Commerce Secretary's comments, Howard Ludnick, about the possibility of a negotiation with Canada and Mexico. [[04:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17111.48s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[04:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17119.48s)]
*  I mean, the tariffs, the market's very uncertain how to take the tariffs. [[04:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17120.48s)]
*  There is an obvious, the tariffs as a way of actually getting further concessions. [[04:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17124.48s)]
*  I think he will get further concessions. [[04:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17129.48s)]
*  I think that will be good news. [[04:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17131.48s)]
*  But unfortunately, my own view is actually that he'll come back with tariffs again and again and again to get further and further concessions. [[04:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17132.48s)]
*  So I think from the point of view of markets, ultimately, I think the trade tariffs will ultimately depress economic activity. [[04:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17138.48s)]
*  I think we will see a slowing of growth. [[04:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17145.48s)]
*  I think that will make it harder for companies to generate profits. [[04:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17146.48s)]
*  Ultimately, I think markets will come down on this. [[04:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17149.48s)]
*  Also as well for European markets, what's happening with Ukraine is so, so critical. [[04:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17151.48s)]
*  We saw Germany brokering more funding for its defense yesterday. [[04:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17156.48s)]
*  Big numbers coming out of Europe in terms of defense spend. [[04:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17163.48s)]
*  Interesting that the President, President Trump, talked quite a bit about Ukraine in his speech and the possibility of peace to come. [[04:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17167.48s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[04:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17176.48s)]
*  And actually, of course, what that really means is that the European area needs to increase expenditure quite heavily on defense. [[04:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17177.48s)]
*  It's a big part of the budget, which might increase going forward. [[04:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17183.48s)]
*  They don't really have a lot of budget surplus at the moment. [[04:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17186.48s)]
*  So that probably means cuts elsewhere. [[04:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17189.48s)]
*  So I think this is going to be quite disruptive actually for global economy again because our government expenditure is going to be rising. [[04:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17190.48s)]
*  I think bond valuations, which have been holding up OK, you know, we've seen generally bonds coming down in terms of the valuations of bonds, bond yields recently. [[04:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17197.48s)]
*  But I think ultimately the government's going to have to issue more bonds and that ultimately I think will crowd out the activity in the ordinary economy. [[04:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17205.48s)]
*  So I think actually it's going to be quite an unsettled period even for the European markets as well as the US. [[04:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17213.48s)]
*  OK, super. [[04:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17218.48s)]

*  They're participating in the National People's Congress. [[04:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17303.48s)]
*  And a few hours ago, the government announced it's keeping its economic growth target unchanged for the year at five percent. [[04:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17305.48s)]
*  The country's economy is currently struggling with weak spending, a lengthy property crisis and ballooning government debt. [[04:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17314.48s)]

*  China's premier, Li Chang, said in response to the tariffs, his country would commit more funds to mitigate global shifts, which had been unseen in a century. [[04:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhB1IqLwroA&t=17328.48s)]
