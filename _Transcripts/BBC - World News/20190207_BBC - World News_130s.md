Video Description: The EU and UK will hold further talks on changes to their Brexit deal to help Theresa May get it through the Commons.
It comes after what both sides said was a "robust but constructive" meeting between Mrs May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Mrs May wants to prevent the UK being "trapped" in the backstop - the plan to keep the Irish border open.
Mr Juncker ruled out legally-binding changes to the backstop clause in the withdrawal agreement.
But he said the EU would be open to adding words to the non-binding future relations document that goes with the withdrawal agreement, following their meeting.
