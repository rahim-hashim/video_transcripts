**BBC - World News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g)
*  Hello again. A court in South Korea has ordered the release from custody of the impeached [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=0.0s)]
*  President Yoon Suk-yul, although he won't actually be freed until prosecutors have [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=4.4s)]
*  decided whether or not to appeal against the ruling. Now supporters of the impeached president [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  have been gathering outside the detention centre where Mr Yoon has been held. He's still facing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=14.48s)]
*  charges in the country's constitutional court over his failed attempt to impose martial law [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=20.64s)]
*  back in January. Well I've been discussing the latest developments with Nemo Kim, she's a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=26.64s)]
*  journalist in Seoul and she's got more on the court order to release President Yoon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=31.28s)]
*  The decision to revoke his detention today means that he should be released [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=39.04s)]
*  anytime now. His supporters are waiting by the detention centre chanting and singing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  very hopeful sounding songs. And the decision from the court today, although has raised a lot [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=50.8s)]
*  of questions about its possible impact on his upcoming criminal trial as well as the final [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=57.44s)]
*  stages of his impeachment trial, the court ruled that the insurrection charge is outside the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  jurisdiction of the CIO, the Corruption Investigation Office for High Ranking Officials. And this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=69.92s)]
*  casts doubt on the whole legality of his arrest and also raises concerns about whether evidence [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=75.52s)]
*  collected by that agency should be considered inadmissible. And this reinforces the claim from [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=82.64s)]
*  his legal team who's been saying that the CIO overstepped its legal authority. And with his [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  criminal trial beginning in a couple of weeks, both sides are expected to debate whether the CIO's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=96.56s)]
*  evidence should be thrown out or not. His supporters, including ruling party lawmaker [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=103.04s)]
*  Chu Jin-woo, they say there is no reason for the prosecution to appeal today's decision just to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=108.56s)]
*  delay his release. The anti-Yoon faction, namely the Democratic Party and those who believe [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=115.04s)]
*  President Yoon should be punished for what he did back in December, they are visibly unsettled by [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=121.2s)]
*  today's ruling with several opposition lawmakers rushing to state that this will not and should not [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=127.36s)]
*  impact the impeachment trial. The verdict is expected to come out sometime in the next few [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=134.72s)]
*  days or nor the criminal trial. But the ruling party insists that the decision has major [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=141.2s)]
*  implications for both trials. And what's interesting is that actually there does seem to be quite a lot [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=147.68s)]
*  of support for Mr. Yoon, doesn't there? And the country is actually quite divided, isn't it? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=153.84s)]
*  Yes, that's right. In my many years of covering South Korea, I've never felt this atmosphere of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=161.04s)]
*  divisiveness. There are pro and anti-Yoon protests continuing nationwide. And having observed both [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=171.28s)]
*  sides firsthand for several weeks now, I would say with the naked eye, the pro-Yoon demonstrations [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=179.28s)]
*  are visibly larger. And you could say it's a lot more emotionally charged for them because [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=186.56s)]
*  the person they support is detained, basically. And that, I think, brings out the intensity of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=193.04s)]
*  their emotions. Now, the anti-Yoon side also argues that martial law disrupted South Korean society, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=199.04s)]
*  caused economic hardships for many people, and he should be punished for what he did. And also, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=207.2s)]
*  some of the anti-Yoon people, they say that he should have tried to pursue bipartisan corporation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=214.56s)]
*  They argue that declaring martial law just because he failed to achieve it makes no sense. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf4d2GHf7g&t=220.56s)]
