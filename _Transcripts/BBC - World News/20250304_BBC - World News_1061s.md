Urusula von der Leyen said Europe was in an "era of rearmament" as she outlined plans to mobilise close to 800bn euros of defence spending.
 
US Vice-President JD Vance has said the door is open for Ukraine to return to negotiations if President Volodymyr Zelensky "is willing to seriously talk peace".

# US pauses military aid to Ukraine as EU chief says Europe is 'ready to step up' | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0)
*  The UK government says it remains absolutely committed to peace in Ukraine and that it's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=0.0s)]
*  engaging with key allies after President Trump paused US military aid to the war-torn country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=5.48s)]
*  A short while ago, the EU Commission president outlined her plan to strengthen Europe's military [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=11.8s)]
*  capability, saying it would help the bloc get immediate military equipment to Ukraine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  An official in Washington explained President Trump's decision by saying, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=22.92s)]
*  The president's been clear that he's focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  to that goal as well. We're pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it's contributing to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=31.56s)]
*  a solution. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=36.64s)]
*  Since returning to the White House, President Trump's claimed on a number of occasions that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=38.04s)]
*  the Biden administration gave Ukraine $350 billion in military assistance. BBC News has [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=42.8s)]
*  not been able to verify that figure. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=49.16s)]
*  The US Department of Defence says the amount spent on military assistance to Ukraine in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=52.24s)]
*  three years since the Russian invasion amounts to just over $180 billion. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=56.36s)]
*  President Trump's move comes days after that heated exchange between him and President [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=61.6s)]
*  Zelensky and Vice President Vance in the Oval Office. Speaking to Fox News before the military [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=67.0s)]
*  aid was paused, Vice President Vance said, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  The door is open if Mr Zelensky is willing to talk peace. Mr Vance also suggested that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=74.92s)]
*  giving Washington an economic interest in the future of Ukraine would serve as a security [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  guarantee. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=85.68s)]
*  If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=87.72s)]
*  does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=92.72s)]
*  upside in the future of Ukraine. That is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=99.08s)]
*  troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years. The security [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=105.08s)]
*  guarantee and also the economic guarantee for Ukraine is to rebuild the country and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=110.84s)]
*  ensure that America has a long-term interest. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=116.4s)]
*  JT Vance there. Well, Ukraine does produce some of its own weaponry, but it does rely [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=118.8s)]
*  of aid from overseas allies such as America and Europe. With more on all of that, here's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=124.44s)]
*  BBC Verifies' Nick Hurdley. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=130.16s)]
*  What would a reduction in US support look like and could Europe step in to fill funding [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=133.52s)]
*  and equipment gaps? Let's look at spending first of all. The US is the biggest individual [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  spender by some margin. This shows all military aid going into Ukraine. In red, the United [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=142.76s)]
*  States. In blue, every other country combined. That is a huge amount of cash for Europe and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=149.04s)]
*  other countries to find. Very roughly, to keep the same level of spending without the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=155.64s)]
*  US, every other country would have to double its military support. It's a big ask when [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=160.72s)]
*  there are so many pressures on public spending. For the UK, that's about Â£2.8 billion extra [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  every year. Then there's equipment. This is a high Mars rocket launcher. The US has [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=173.16s)]
*  provided 39 of these to Ukraine according to the Kiel Institute think tank. European [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=178.48s)]
*  countries combined have provided 43 similar systems. There are these, long range attack [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=183.28s)]
*  missiles provided by Washington. There are European alternatives like the British Storm [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=189.28s)]
*  Shadows, but the attack missiles have been important for Ukraine's army. And then there's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=194.64s)]
*  ammunition. A huge volume of artillery has been used in this conflict. The US has sent [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=199.12s)]
*  more than 4.5 million rounds. The EU has previously missed its timetable for sending just one [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=205.76s)]
*  million. Production in Europe has increased. The EU has promised 2 million rounds in 2025. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  Some experts have questioned whether that pledge can be met. Now, this is some of the quantifiable [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  support. Remember, some of it isn't like intelligence assistance. And the debate around [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=224.12s)]
*  support for Ukraine raises other questions about US support for NATO. This was what Elon [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=229.88s)]
*  Musk said over the weekend. He thinks it's time for the USA to leave the alliance. And [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=236.32s)]
*  that would have a huge financial impact. Here we can see NATO member defence spending in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=242.2s)]
*  red, the United States in blue, every other country combined. If the USA reduced or even [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=248.32s)]
*  ended its funding, the impact would be colossal, even as European countries pledge to increase [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=255.44s)]
*  their defence spending. That's Nick Urdley from BBC Verify there. Well, in Ukraine itself, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=261.92s)]
*  reports suggest that the country's current stockpile of weapons will last another six [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=268.08s)]
*  months. MPs have already been discussing the consequences of America pausing its military [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=272.04s)]
*  aid there. Our Ukraine correspondent is James Waterhouse. There are ministers calling for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=277.28s)]
*  calm. There are MPs arguing that if Ukraine is fighting for peace, fighting for its survival, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=282.76s)]
*  then President Zelensky should just go and sign this mineral deal, should apologise, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=290.52s)]
*  should give America the repeated thank yous it seems to be calling for if it's all in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=294.88s)]
*  the name of Ukraine's continued survival. But this is a political lever that has been [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=299.12s)]
*  most feared. The last time this happened, when American aid was slowed by disagreements [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=304.56s)]
*  in the US Congress, President Zelensky said Ukraine lost lives and land. There was an [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=309.96s)]
*  eastern town called Avdivka, which was once a fortress, which fell because Ukrainian soldiers [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=316.08s)]
*  partly ran out of kits that they needed to sustain their attack. If you go to the western [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=322.2s)]
*  border in the country, there are constant convoys of military aid coming in under police [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  They are an artery. They are much needed armour and ammunition needed by exhausted troops [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=333.12s)]
*  to keep fighting this full-scale invasion that Russia exerts. So this has long been [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=340.36s)]
*  feared. Seemingly it could be resolved in a political sense, but at the moment, in the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=347.4s)]
*  words of one Ukrainian advocacy group, you've got Russia that's been given the green light [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=355.0s)]
*  to keep advancing, which it is in the eastern Donetsk region. You've got these reports [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=360.4s)]
*  of America exploring a relaxation of sanctions, trying to continue to warm relations with [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=365.2s)]
*  Moscow as it deals directly with Moscow, and all of the levers and pressure is being exerted [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=371.44s)]
*  on Ukraine as it's looking in both directions now. James Walsh, House in Kyiv there. Well, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=377.08s)]
*  in the last hour, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has been talking [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  about a new plan to boost military and help Ukraine in the process. We are in an era of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=387.64s)]
*  rearmament and Europe is ready to massively boost its defence spending, both to respond [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=396.64s)]
*  to the short-term urgency to act and to support Ukraine, but also to address the long-term [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=404.24s)]
*  need to take on more responsibility for our own European security. Lots of reaction, of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=411.56s)]
*  course, coming in this morning to the news of America suspending military aid to Ukraine. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=419.6s)]
*  We've also heard from the British government now, the Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=426.64s)]
*  appearing on the BBC's Today programme, speaking to Emma Barnett. This was her reaction. Let's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=430.92s)]
*  have a listen. We are focused on support for Ukraine, bringing the US around the table [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=436.88s)]
*  alongside our European partners in Ukraine. We've put our money where our mouth is and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=444.52s)]
*  stepped up our support for Ukraine through air defence, through military capabilities [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=449.48s)]
*  and through the military aid we give year upon year. And the Prime Minister will not [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=454.44s)]
*  conduct dialogue on open airways. He will continue to do what he's done in the last [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=458.84s)]
*  couple of days, which is to bring about that peace. And the US have said consistently [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=463.0s)]
*  that they want to see peace in Ukraine and the Prime Minister is focused on getting that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=469.56s)]
*  peace but also has made it really clear that the peace has to be sustainable with security [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=474.36s)]
*  guarantees and that's what the Prime Minister's focused on. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=480.6s)]
*  That's the Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner there. Well, lots to get through. Let's speak [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=483.84s)]
*  to our international editor Jeremy Bowen who joins us now. Jeremy, loads to talk about, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  of course. Let's start with your assessment of how you think what we heard from the White [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=496.12s)]
*  House will change, an already complicated picture when it comes to global relations [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=501.76s)]
*  over the war in Ukraine. Well, first of all, the important thing to recognise is that this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  is really the most serious crisis in the history of the transatlantic alliance, the transatlantic [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=512.6s)]
*  relationship since it was formed during and after the Second World War. It is that big. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=518.6999999999999s)]
*  Why is it that big? It's essentially because the Americans are now on an opposite side [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=524.38s)]
*  to the position of the Europeans as expressed in that summit in London over the weekend. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=530.86s)]
*  And subsequently, of course, people want peace. Everyone will say, yeah, of course, I want [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=536.74s)]
*  peace. Countries want peace. But the issue is, what is the price of peace? Is the price [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=542.42s)]
*  of peace, as the Russians have said, essentially Ukrainian capitulation and the Americans [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=548.22s)]
*  appear to be sharing a lot of talking points, they're definitely sharing a lot of talking points [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=556.34s)]
*  with the Americans. Or is it the kind of peace that was being talked about by Kirstama and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=561.0600000000001s)]
*  others at the weekend as they very openly supported President Zelensky? And that means that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=567.62s)]
*  the Europeans and the British have been taking a very high profile role in all of this are [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=574.4200000000001s)]
*  essentially trying to execute an extraordinarily difficult high wire act. On the one side, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=580.9s)]
*  there's this support that they have for Ukraine and an offer to put boots on the ground, planes [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=588.26s)]
*  in the air. And on the other side, there's the Americans who have been rather rude about [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=593.46s)]
*  this. I mean, JD Vance's comments overnight where he was saying some countries that have [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=597.3000000000001s)]
*  not fought a war for 30 years, he dismissed them. Far better to have American financial [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=603.5s)]
*  interests there. So to try to sustain that high wire act to somehow keep Trump happy [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=608.3s)]
*  at the same time, not sell Ukraine down the river, that might actually be impossible. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=616.54s)]
*  And Jeremy, as we look at what is potentially, as you say, an impossible situation to work [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=622.86s)]
*  back from, is the only way the US might walk back on some of this if President Zelensky [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=627.94s)]
*  says sorry, because that's what some people have been speculating over, or indeed if he [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=635.22s)]
*  leaves the office? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=639.58s)]
*  Well, yeah, it is extraordinary to say, but there was a time until quite recently when [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=641.1800000000001s)]
*  American foreign policy was based on a system of alliances where people, of course, America [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=645.66s)]
*  put its own interests first, but where there were also shared interests. Now, the idea [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=652.22s)]
*  is Trump's view, which is America first, which is essentially the rest of the world is raw [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=656.86s)]
*  material for America to do deals, to get richer, to be more powerful. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=662.34s)]
*  And it's a throwback to big powers in the 19th century when they would get together. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=667.54s)]
*  The British, of course, were one of those and just decide things for themselves, send [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=673.66s)]
*  gunboats if necessary, if not send traders and merchants. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=678.78s)]
*  And, yeah, so this is a really difficult, serious crisis, and it may well be the unraveling [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=682.9s)]
*  of that alliance, which has lasted for so long. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=690.7s)]
*  Indeed. And of course, we see European leaders. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=693.26s)]
*  We saw that the weekend that meeting in London, for example, trying to come up with some sort [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=696.06s)]
*  of plan. We've seen that offer from France as well and the UK working with them on that. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=701.06s)]
*  Is that going to have any leverage with the US? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=707.42s)]
*  Will they sign up to that now? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=710.66s)]
*  Well, it's hard to know, perhaps. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=713.34s)]
*  I think the action of suspending arms shipments is undoubtedly by the Americans a gambit to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=717.62s)]
*  try and get Zelensky to the table. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=724.66s)]
*  But let's assume he does come to the table. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=726.98s)]
*  Let's assume he goes to the White House or to Mar-a-Lago, cap in hand, says to, you know, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=729.5s)]
*  like a naughty schoolboy, says to JD Vance or Donald Trump, look, I'm terribly sorry for [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=735.58s)]
*  sticking up for myself like that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=741.46s)]
*  I won't do it again. Won't happen again. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=742.9s)]
*  And where's that contract? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=744.66s)]
*  I want to sign it and sign away a lot of mineral rights to the Americans. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=745.82s)]
*  What happens after that? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=749.94s)]
*  Because when they get to the table, then the situation may well be if Vladimir Putin or [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=751.14s)]
*  his people are there, that they will say, look, we've made it very clear what happens. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=758.14s)]
*  Ukraine needs to be demilitarized. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=762.0600000000001s)]
*  We, the Russians, need to keep territory. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=766.02s)]
*  Well, would the Ukrainians Zelensky or some successor accept that? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=769.02s)]
*  Would Europe accept that after everything it said about protecting Ukraine? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=774.8199999999999s)]
*  There are so many imponderables. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=780.8199999999999s)]
*  But what makes it a lot more difficult to try to solve is the the the there's a great [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=783.22s)]
*  lack of clarity now because of Trump. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=790.54s)]
*  And you can argue that, in fact, look, the what was going on before under Biden was a [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=792.42s)]
*  going to work. He gave Ukraine enough weapons not to lose, but not to win either, because [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=798.9s)]
*  he was worried about what the Russians might do. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=804.78s)]
*  He took their nuclear threat seriously. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=807.22s)]
*  So Trump supporters would say he's just being realistic. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=809.86s)]
*  And of course, both sides are going to have to give something. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=814.78s)]
*  But at the moment, the way the Americans are presenting it, the givers of the Ukrainians [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=818.38s)]
*  and the takers are the Russians and also the Americans, because, of course, another [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=823.66s)]
*  it's quite clear that another big priority of Donald Trump is mending America's relationship [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=829.78s)]
*  with Russia. Yeah. And Jeremy, you talk about Russia. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=836.3s)]
*  We're just seeing lines coming into us from the Kremlin, from the Reuters news agency, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=838.8199999999999s)]
*  one here saying if the US stops these supplies, it will be the best contribution to the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=843.4599999999999s)]
*  cause of peace. So Vladimir Putin, presumably watching on, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=848.74s)]
*  with quite a lot of glee, looking at what's been unfolding. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=853.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think for Russia, for peace, read Victory. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=857.3s)]
*  This is Christmas every day for them at the moment. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=860.78s)]
*  This is reflected in the things they put out in social media, the way that the pro-Putin [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=863.8199999999999s)]
*  media have been crowing with delight about what's happening. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=868.42s)]
*  And I've just spent a couple of weeks in Ukraine, only got back a few days ago. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=873.0999999999999s)]
*  And of course, there's consternation there about what's happening. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=877.3399999999999s)]
*  And also, I have to say, from certainly soldiers I spoke to in areas near the Russian [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=881.34s)]
*  border who had been fighting, for example, in Kursk, which is the area that the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=886.9s)]
*  Ukrainians took from Russia back in last August. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=892.78s)]
*  I mean, they're quite defiant. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=897.06s)]
*  They said they're going to fight on, that drones are now such a big part of the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=898.34s)]
*  battlefield. And they are that they can get by. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=902.54s)]
*  They don't necessarily need what the Americans have got, though they do accept the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=905.8199999999999s)]
*  losing US intelligence, losing air defenses, losing the ammo for these very sophisticated [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=911.02s)]
*  weapons they've been given and the satellite information they need to acquire targets. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=918.3000000000001s)]
*  All of that is going to be very difficult for them. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=923.22s)]
*  But they are. They're building a lot of their own weapons. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=926.74s)]
*  And I don't think the thing you have to remember is that for the Ukrainians, this is [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=930.58s)]
*  about existence. It's not about real estate. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=936.02s)]
*  It's not about, well, maybe we can do a deal, give Putin some land and he'll be [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=938.46s)]
*  satisfied. They believe that Putin will never be satisfied until he's broken [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=943.02s)]
*  Ukrainian independence and sovereignty and certainly his own writings suggest that is [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=948.4200000000001s)]
*  very much what he wants to do. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=953.38s)]
*  And Jeremy, we're hearing from some Ukrainian politicians that they believe they have [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=955.02s)]
*  enough military supplies, at least for the next six months or so. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=958.98s)]
*  But you were just drawing on your experience having just returned from Ukraine and what [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=962.26s)]
*  we've seen in recent days is a huge number of drone attacks continuing on Ukraine. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=967.34s)]
*  A reminder, of course, that while all these talks continue, the war continues on. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=973.98s)]
*  I just wondered if I could get your assessment of how you see things going militarily, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=978.98s)]
*  militarily, I should say, given this news now as well. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=983.74s)]
*  Well, without American weapons, it is going to be easier for the Russians, no doubt about [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=987.46s)]
*  it. I mean, while I was in Cuba, for example, they had their worst [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=992.1s)]
*  the biggest drone attack they'd had since the start of all this from the Russians. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=997.86s)]
*  The Russians have also been boasting about that on their own outlets. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1003.34s)]
*  And, you know, for hours that night in the capital city, there were you could see search [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1007.74s)]
*  lights going through the sky, old style anti-aircraft cannon firing tracer [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1012.74s)]
*  up at these drones. And you could hear the drones as well. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1018.82s)]
*  I mean, I could hear the drones very clearly when I was standing on the roof of our hotel [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1021.26s)]
*  doing lives for the BBC there. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1025.18s)]
*  So the situation is, though, that both sides are actually very good at this drone warfare [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1028.46s)]
*  now. And the majority of casualties on both sides are being caused now [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1032.7s)]
*  by drones. The shape of the war has changed since it began. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1038.14s)]
*  When you remember there were these lines of tanks and there was old fashioned heavy [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1041.74s)]
*  artillery going on. It looked rather like World War Two or World War One even. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1046.02s)]
*  It's different now because these drones are transforming things. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1050.3400000000001s)]
*  They're absolutely deadly and they make the they make even movement on the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1053.78s)]
*  battlefield incredibly dangerous and difficult. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJsER0dqH-0&t=1057.5s)]
