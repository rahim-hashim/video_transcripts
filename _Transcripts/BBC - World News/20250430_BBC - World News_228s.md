# Trump praises tariffs in Cabinet meeting as US economy shrinks for first time since 2022 | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg)
*  In a blow to President Trump, the US economy shrank in his first three [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=0.0s)]
*  months in office. American gross domestic product, a measure of all [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=4.68s)]
*  the goods and services in the economy, dropped by 0.3% from January [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=8.4s)]
*  to March, a sharp fall after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Well, President Trump has blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, and said [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=18.68s)]
*  the downturn was nothing to do with his controversial policy on tariffs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=22.28s)]
*  Let's go live to our North America editor, Sarah Smith, at the White [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=26.72s)]
*  House. Sarah, how damaging do you think these figures are for the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=29.52s)]
*  Trump administration? Well, it goes right to the core of the biggest [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=32.68s)]
*  reason why Donald Trump was elected when he promised to fix the economy [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=38.12s)]
*  and reduce inflation. Since then, the cost of living hasn't really [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=42.56s)]
*  fallen significantly and now we see these numbers saying that the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=46.6s)]
*  economy is in fact contracting. So it goes against what he promised to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=49.84s)]
*  do. Donald Trump did return to the US on the 20th of January, these [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=54.32s)]
*  figures covered January, February, March, but he says they're not his [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=58.96s)]
*  fault at all, since he's trying to blame it all on his predecessor. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  You probably saw some numbers today, and I have to start off by saying [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=64.84s)]
*  that's Biden, that's not Trump, because we came in on January, these [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=69.12s)]
*  are quarterly numbers, and we came in and I was very against everything [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=73.12s)]
*  that Biden was doing in terms of the economy destroying our country in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=81.28s)]
*  so many ways. Of course, the biggest move on the economy that Donald [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=85.16s)]
*  Trump has made is introducing those very high trade tariffs, which he [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=89.08s)]
*  did at the start of April, but they have affected these numbers because [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=92.32s)]
*  there was a huge surge of imports into America from families and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  businesses that were trying to import foreign-made goods before the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=100.12s)]
*  tariff regime kicked in. So that has affected the figures somewhat, but [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=103.56s)]
*  we will need to wait until the next quarter to see exactly what impact [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=107.88s)]
*  having imposed those high import taxes is going to have on the American [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=112.04s)]
*  economy. OK, Sarah, thank you. And meanwhile, the United States and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=115.44s)]
*  Ukraine are close to finally signing a deal on mineral resources, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=119.64s)]
*  possibly within the next 24 hours. It would see the two countries [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=124.2s)]
*  jointly develop Ukraine's mineral wealth. President Trump says it will [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=127.8s)]
*  be money back for all the aid that America has given Ukraine in its war [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=132.04s)]
*  with Russia. Well, an earlier version of the deal collapsed after the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=136.6s)]
*  rally in the White House between Mr Trump and Ukraine's President [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=140.48s)]
*  Zelensky. Live now to John Donison, our correspondent in the Ukrainian [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=143.76s)]
*  capital, Kyiv. So, John, after a lot of false starts, it does look like [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=147.44s)]
*  this is going to be signed at last. Well, certainly that's what the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=150.88s)]
*  Ukrainians are saying. The country's economy minister is currently en [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=156.44s)]
*  route to Washington, D.C. to meet with U.S. officials, and as you say, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  they're saying the deal could be done within 24 hours. There are [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=164.92s)]
*  reported to be some last minute disagreements, so let's wait and see. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=168.84s)]
*  But what this deal does is it basically gives America access to Ukraine's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=172.68s)]
*  oil, gas, energy infrastructure, mineral wealth and money from those [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=178.0s)]
*  industries would go into a joint U.S.-Ukrainian investment fund, and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=183.28s)]
*  then some of that money would go towards paying for Ukraine's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  reconstruction and also towards paying for American continued military [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=193.0s)]
*  and humanitarian assistance. Now, there are some who say, critics of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=198.64s)]
*  the deal, who say it amounts to the U.S. extorting Ukraine, but I think [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  the Ukrainian government has made the calculation that if America has a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=207.88s)]
*  biggest stake in the country, it could improve relations and push America [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=212.16s)]
*  to get a better deal in the more important deal for Ukraine, which is, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  of course, ending the war with Russia. And those peace talks are ongoing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zrt6_lOwVg&t=222.48s)]
