**BBC - World News:** [January 30, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k)
*  Please God be in here. Smack, heroin comes before everyone, everything. Your children, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=0.0s)]
*  your everything. My mom, everyone. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=8.34s)]
*  Unshyamadam, things like this has really got to me. To beg for drugs, it's just horrible. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=19.0s)]
*  Yeah, heroin. It helps people just escape from the things that people done to them in this life mostly. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=28.0s)]
*  Like a lot of people would have been raped or abused or brought up in crazy families. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=38.0s)]
*  I was sent to a really posh private boarding school in Ireland. Social welfare sent me there because my mom was very sick. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=45.0s)]
*  Yeah, I started telling a lot of lies then to try to fit in with the rich kids. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=54.0s)]
*  I mean it was a very clever way to abuse people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=65.0s)]
*  I don't want to get emotional so I'll just take a minute, a second. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=72.0s)]
*  Yeah, the reason I had the nervous breakdown was over that because I thought it was my fault. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=77.0s)]
*  I didn't realize I was manipulated by him. Yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=83.0s)]
*  And because the skill was so posh, I always felt like nobody believed me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=90.0s)]
*  And for someone to take your manhood away is... Yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=95.0s)]
*  It's like it's startling in an instant. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=102.0s)]
*  Any spare change for the couple of guys? I had a house, I had a car, I had a wife, kids. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=107.0s)]
*  I had a brilliant job up in Scotland. Any spare change please? I'll go back there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=114.0s)]
*  The mother said there was a job there for us. Thank you so much darling. Thank you, God bless. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=119.0s)]
*  It's degrading not having to beg to feed yourself. I'd do that and go and steal from somebody. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=124.0s)]
*  It's easy enough stealing but if you get caught you go to prison. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=130.0s)]
*  Where I do what I'm doing to survive. Thank you so much. Good night, God bless. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=134.0s)]
*  I'm always pleasant and polite. Always pleasant and thank yous. Man has caught snout. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=141.0s)]
*  It's more annoying when they ignore you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=146.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day they're no different to me because they're only one paycheck away from being in my situation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=152.0s)]
*  But Rome wasn't built in the night. Patience is a virtue mate. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=159.0s)]
*  I could win the lottery tomorrow. That would be a good one. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=167.0s)]
*  We're trying to get 1650 between us so that's like eight county. You just get a room for the night. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=174.0s)]
*  God bless. If we can't make that then we'll sleep at the top of the street. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=180.0s)]
*  We've got a couple of blankets and we've got a tent. Some blood punched her in the face the other day. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=185.0s)]
*  Look, it's head about there for nothing. We're normal people. We're someone's daughter. We're someone's mother. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=191.0s)]
*  We've both got kids. Thank you. It's just respect isn't it? It is. But we'll get there and end. Touch wood. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=198.0s)]
*  Always get there and end. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=205.0s)]
*  Fairly change please. Fairly change please. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=209.0s)]
*  Thank you very much my darling. Your hands are freezing. Would you like a pair of gloves? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=213.0s)]
*  Thank you my darling. Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=221.0s)]
*  Thank you my love. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=229.0s)]
*  I'm going to cry. She was going to cry. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=231.0s)]
*  Oh was she? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=234.0s)]
*  I'll say there's some nice people. I know Tony a pipe out of her nose bud. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=238.0s)]
*  I think she had problems there though. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=242.0s)]
*  Hey when that happens and the heroin comes to an end. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=251.0s)]
*  Because I know it's back out to the same thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=255.0s)]
*  And I'm going to go off towards the night clubs now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=259.0s)]
*  Because here it looks very very empty I guess. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=263.0s)]
*  Six. Cheers. Thank you very much. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=270.0s)]
*  We've got an option. I take notes. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=272.0s)]
*  Are you hungry? Cheers. Thank you. I'm really hungry. Yeah. Yeah. I'm very hungry. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=274.0s)]
*  This way it gets a lot more rough coming down here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=277.0s)]
*  Hi. Hello lovely people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=280.0s)]
*  Seven ten. Eight ten. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=282.0s)]
*  Martin May you are a good guy right? Why do you not work? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=286.0s)]
*  Mental health problems is one. 21, 22. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=289.0s)]
*  Cheers man. Cheers lad. Thank you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=294.0s)]
*  Bear change for an Irish lad please will you? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=296.0s)]
*  Coming to Newcastle the kindness of people has shown me that there is some light. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=300.0s)]
*  Before I didn't think there was any possibilities at all. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=306.0s)]
*  I guess there is a glimmer of hope. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=310.0s)]
*  And this is my biggest biggest rock bottom. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=314.0s)]
*  I think it would be anybody's biggest rock bottom. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=318.0s)]
*  So I hope the only way is up and not a rope. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLNvNH9AU_k&t=321.0s)]
