Video Description: During the height of the migrant crisis in 2016, over 11,000 Nigerian women made the journey to Italy in the hope of making a better life.
It’s estimated that 80% were trafficked and forced into prostitution.
Before they left home many were made to undergo a juju, or black magic, ceremony in which they swore – on pain of death - they would pay back their traffickers.
The strain of believing they were living under a spell has added to their mental health problems.
One women, Magdalen, shared her story with the BBC.

# Trafficked into prostitution with black magic - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q)
*  When I came to Europe, I think I'm going to be a better person. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Not knowing that, I'm going to go back, back, back. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=7.0s)]
*  A prostitute is what you will to do. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=11.0s)]
*  Victims of sexual trafficking is something that somebody forces you to do. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=14.0s)]
*  The impact is devastating. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=19.0s)]
*  In the meantime, it is extremely difficult for them to tell their experiences. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=22.0s)]
*  Because these are experiences that do not allow words. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=27.0s)]
*  I can't advise my fellow girls to come to Italy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=32.0s)]
*  Here is job, no job. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=37.0s)]
*  I get to Italy July 12. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=57.0s)]
*  It was not my intention to come to Italy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=62.0s)]
*  I did not go up with my family, I went up with my uncle. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=65.0s)]
*  He sent me to a woman. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=68.0s)]
*  So the woman is the one that brought me to Italy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=70.0s)]
*  I was happy because my uncle that I stayed with, he treated me a lot. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=73.0s)]
*  I was not afraid because he did not tell me I'm coming to Europe to do prostitution. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=78.0s)]
*  The Kafte, he lost us inside the sea. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=83.0s)]
*  So we can't find our way out. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=87.0s)]
*  Next thing we saw, the big sheep coming and they rescued all of us. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=90.0s)]
*  All of us were happy because we are going to be alive. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=95.0s)]
*  We came to Palermo. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=99.0s)]
*  There is one man, he has connections. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=101.0s)]
*  He is a prostitute. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=104.0s)]
*  He is a prostitute. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=106.0s)]

*  We don't know we are going to pay back. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=112.0s)]
*  I don't know anybody in Palermo. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=115.0s)]
*  I can't say I'm not going to do it because if I say I'm not going to do it, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=117.0s)]
*  the man is going to say, okay, leave my ass. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epfED62IA8Q&t=121.0s)]
