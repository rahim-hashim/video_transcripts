Video Description: Deadly Israeli air strikes have been reported in Gaza, as Israel's defence minister said its military would expand its offensive and seize large areas of the Palestinian territory, incorporating them into what he described as "security zones".
 
Israel Katz said the expanded operation aimed to "destroy and clear the area of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure", and would require a large-scale evacuation of Palestinians.
 
Later, at least 19 Palestinians, including nine children, were killed in a strike on a UN clinic sheltering displaced families in the northern town of Jabalia, the nearby Indonesian hospital said.
 
The Israeli military said it targeted "Hamas terrorists" hiding there.
 
Overnight strikes across Gaza killed at least 20 more people, according to local hospitals.

*  operation in Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Israel cuts saying large areas of the territory would be seized and added to Israel's existing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=18.0s)]
*  security zones. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=22.96s)]
*  Let's show you Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Ghivir. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=25.2s)]
*  Very inflammatory this visit this morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=31.04s)]
*  He is visiting the Al Aqsa compound and that happened a few hours ago. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  We're starting to get response as well from Hamas just talking about how inflammatory this is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=37.84s)]
*  He walked out of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition back in January [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=44.0s)]
*  over the Gaza ceasefire deal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=49.2s)]
*  Lots of strands to bring together, lots of developing stories to bring you from the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=51.68s)]
*  conflict. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=57.6s)]
*  So let's take you straight to Jerusalem and join our Middle East correspondent Yolande Nel who is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=58.16s)]
*  there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=62.56s)]
*  Firstly Yolande, what are we hearing from Jabalia and the strike on a UN clinic? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=63.2s)]
*  Well what we were told by the local hospital is that at least 19 people were killed in an [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=71.52s)]
*  Israeli strike on that building in Jabalia in the north of the Gaza Strip that was being used as a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=77.28s)]
*  shelter for displaced people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=84.64s)]
*  There's now been a statement that's come out from the Israeli military. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=88.0s)]
*  It says that it was targeting what it calls Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=93.28s)]
*  Says that they were using this site as a command and control centre to coordinate attacks. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=97.84s)]
*  A lot of details on all of this still very sketchy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=105.2s)]
*  There is some footage that has come out from the scene that we've not yet been able to verify. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=107.68s)]
*  It shows smoke billowing from this UN building. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  There are some very harrowing images that show a small baby among those apparently killed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  And this comes as Israel's defence minister announcing an expansion of the military operation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=128.4s)]
*  Can you explain what that will mean for people there, Yolande? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=129.36s)]
*  Well already we're hearing from Israeli army radio that Israeli tanks have begun to push into the centre [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=134.4s)]
*  and the east of Raffa in the south of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=142.32s)]
*  This came after the Israeli defence minister put out this statement really sort of adding to the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=146.96s)]
*  impression that a major ground offensive was looming. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  And he's saying that large areas of Gaza will be seized and added to what Israel calls its security zones [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=157.6s)]
*  and warned that this will involve large-scale evacuations of the population. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=166.4s)]
*  Already we had seen this week the UN says 140,000 people being told to flee from the area of Raffa, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  told to go to Al-Muassi, this sprawling, tented camp on the coast. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=181.04s)]
*  And that as well as other evacuation orders for the north as well is really adding to the feelings [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=188.0s)]
*  of great uncertainty on the ground, the deteriorating situation. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=196.32s)]
*  Because of course it's also a month today since Israel closed all crossings for aid going into [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=201.76s)]
*  Gaza and that is leading to major shortages of food, of medicines, of fuel as well. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=207.84s)]
*  The other story to bring our viewers as well, Yolande, just in the past two minutes or so Hamas [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=214.56s)]
*  has responded to this visit by Atma Ben Gavir till the Al-Aqsa mosque saying it is a dangerous [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=220.08s)]
*  escalation and we've just had pictures through of that visit as well. Can you explain how inflammatory [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=227.12s)]
*  this visit was? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=232.88s)]
*  Well of course the Al-Aqsa mosque it is the most important holy site here for Muslims. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=234.0s)]
*  It is also a site that is holy for Jews who see it as Temple Mount. It's the most holy site [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=241.52s)]
*  in Judaism but this is coming at the end of the major Eid al-Fitr Islamic festival. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=247.44s)]
*  It's something that has happened repeatedly with Atma Ben Gavir, this [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=254.96s)]
*  real firebrand, far-right minister in his position responsible for national security [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=260.4s)]
*  that he has gone along escorted by large numbers of police forces wanting to show that Israel does [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=266.56s)]
*  have control over this site. It was captured of course by Israel in 1967 in the Middle East war. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=274.96s)]
*  Jerusalem was later annexed by Israel in a move that is not recognized by most of the international [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=283.52s)]
*  community. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=288.56s)]
*  Yolande thank you so much. Yolande Nel joining us there from Jerusalem. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgw6rF4i6Bo&t=289.36s)]
