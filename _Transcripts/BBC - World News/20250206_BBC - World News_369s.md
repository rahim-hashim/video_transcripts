Video Description: US President Donald Trump has restated his plan for a US “takeover” of the Gaza Strip, after his idea was rejected by Palestinians and leaders around the world on Wednesday.

On social media, Trump said Gaza "would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting".

Palestinians "would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region," he added.

# Trump restates plan for US ‘takeover’ of Gaza, with Palestinians ‘resettled in region’ | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI)
*  Hello and welcome to BBC News. Donald Trump has doubled down on his plan for the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=0.0s)]
*  States to take control of Gaza. Also, in the last few minutes, the AFP news agency is reporting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=6.16s)]
*  that Hamas has responded by urging Arab countries to resist the pressure from the US President [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  and hold an urgent Arab summit. Well, Mr. Trump posted details of his thinking on social [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=17.96s)]
*  media saying the territory would be handed over to America by Israel once the fighting [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=22.76s)]
*  there had ended, there'd be no US troops on the ground. He also said the US would work [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=27.48s)]
*  with teams from around the world to rebuild Gaza in what he promised would be, in his [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=32.64s)]
*  words, one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind. Well, let's talk [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=37.2s)]
*  now to our North America correspondent, Nomiyeh Iqbal, and our Gaza correspondent, Rushdie [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=42.84s)]
*  Abu Alouf. And Nomiyeh, to you first of all, despite all the condemnation we've had since [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=47.0s)]
*  Donald Trump made those first remarks, he's given more details today. What has he been [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=53.16s)]
*  saying? He has given more details, but paradoxically, it's really vague as well. So as you said [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=57.72s)]
*  there, he said that Gaza will be turned over to the US by Israel at the end of the war. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  He said that Israel would, presumably Israel would expel all Palestinians, and then the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  US would become the occupying power. All this would be done without US troops on the ground. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=76.16s)]
*  And then Gaza would be rebuilt, not using American money. Palestinians would be resettled [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=80.6s)]
*  elsewhere. But it is confusing because, you know, bear in mind as well that Donald Trump [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=85.88s)]
*  has sold himself to his support, and this is what they love about him. As someone who [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=91.36s)]
*  doesn't believe in nation building, he doesn't believe in getting involved in conflicts overseas. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=95.0s)]
*  So why would he want to get involved in such a complicated conflict, one of the hardest [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=99.6s)]
*  conflicts that has, you know, sort of been really difficult for Americans to solve for [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=104.68s)]
*  decades? And so it looks like he's trying to have his cake and eat it, coming up with [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=110.76s)]
*  lots of different ways of, you know, saying that, well, this is what our plan is. The [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  other question is, what are you going to do about Hamas? How will you dislodge Hamas from [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=119.56s)]
*  Gaza? Because if Arab nations are going to get involved in the rebuilding of Gaza, which [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=123.84s)]
*  is presumably what Mr. Trump wants, they want an answer to that question. And Mr. Trump [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=128.52s)]
*  hasn't really answered that. And we know that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=133.72s)]
*  has said that he wants the war to end only when Hamas is completely destroyed. But defense [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=139.16s)]
*  experts say that that probably is not likely. It's impossible. So how long can this war [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=144.04s)]
*  go on for? Because Mr. Trump also wants peace. He wants the war to end ASAP. So whilst, yes, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=148.8s)]
*  he's given us more details, it's so full of contradictions. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=155.84s)]
*  Nomiya, just briefly, in those original comments, he talked about moving Palestinians out, enforcing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=160.28s)]
*  that it would be permanent, the White House forced to actually row back and water down [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  those comments. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=171.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're now using the term temporary. It's a temporary relocation. And his Secretary [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=172.84s)]
*  of State, Mark Arrubia, is also trying to walk back these comments. This often happens [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  with Donald Trump. He proposes things and then the members of his own kind of team are [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=184.52s)]
*  trying to sort of explain what he actually meant. Mr. Arrubia said, oh, this wasn't meant [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  as a hostile takeover. This is actually a generous offer. We are showing willingness [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  to rebuild and relocate. But I think for a lot of people, Saudi Arab nations who are [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=199.6s)]
*  worried about this, for people in, for Gazans, I think the damage has already been done in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=206.52s)]
*  some ways and there's still a load of confusion around exactly what Mr. Trump's proposal is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  But one thing I should add, Matthew, is that the big question about what happens to Gaza [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=216.2s)]
*  post-war has not really been answered. Even Mr. Netanyahu has dodged that question. So [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  in some respects, Mr. Trump is trying to offer some sort of solution as to what happens to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=226.32s)]
*  Gaza in the future. But it is, of course, a hugely controversial one and one that's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  probably not going to get any backing from members of his own party. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=235.44s)]
*  Nomiya, thanks very much. Let's bring in Rushdie and a twin thought, Rushdie. Tell me more [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  about what people in Gaza have been saying to you reacting to what Donald Trump has said [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=243.8s)]
*  and that call for an urgent Arab summit. Tell me more about that and whether that's likely [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=248.6s)]
*  to happen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=254.16s)]
*  Yeah, there is very big confusion because a statement after a statement from Donald [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=257.96s)]
*  Trump and nobody knows exactly what the plan is. But for Palestinians, no matter what the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=262.64s)]
*  plan is, they're all rejecting the idea of displacement or leaving Gaza. In the official [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=268.68s)]
*  level, the Palestinian Authority issuing a statement, Hamas issuing a statement, saying [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=275.32s)]
*  that we reject that and we call the Arabs to hold urgent summit. But on the ground, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  in practical level, people are continuing to return back to the north. So they are in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=287.8s)]
*  practice refusing the idea by returning back to Gaza City. Well, they all know that Gaza [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=293.16s)]
*  is almost destroyed, especially the northern bar that was subject to a very tough Israeli [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=300.32s)]
*  operation. What meant to force the people out of their villages and towns in the north, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=306.0s)]
*  we have seen a hundred-day operation by the Israelis and everybody believed that this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=312.92s)]
*  was the idea behind the operation is to force people out. Many people, yes, did leave, but [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  those who remain, Palestinians call them heroes because they fought for the last minute, this [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=323.56s)]
*  idea of displacement. In general, all Palestinians, even though some of the people who wanted [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=331.68s)]
*  to leave Gaza, they want to have the right to return. I've spoken to Palestinians in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=338.4s)]
*  Gaza today. Many of them said, yes, we are happy to leave Gaza, but we need to have our [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  right to return, not like what happened back in 1948 when their grandfathers and their [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=350.32s)]
*  family left what is now called Israel and they haven't returned back. So the people [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=356.84s)]
*  on political level, they want to have their rights to stay in Gaza and even if they leave, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=362.12s)]
*  they want to have the right to return. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPrKOFdIvI&t=366.79999999999995s)]
