Video Description: Who will be the next pope? 
 
The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.
It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.
 
The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.

# Who could be the next pope and how will they be chosen? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE)
*  Well, in around 14 days, the process by which the Catholic Church's cardinals choose a new pontiff will begin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=0.0s)]
*  Some have already arrived in Rome for the conclave as it is known, which is steeped in tradition and secrecy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=7.48s)]
*  Mark Easton explains. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=14.84s)]
*  Conclave, where ritual and art, politics and power come together in total secrecy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=22.48s)]
*  The process to decide the next pope will begin in the Sistine Chapel in around two weeks time beneath [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=28.56s)]
*  Michelangelo's extraordinary ceiling. The doors are locked, communication severed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=35.16s)]
*  And the 135 cardinals under 80 and entitled to vote swear an oath of silence. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=42.44s)]
*  The first rule of conclave is you do not talk about conclave. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  I wonder if I could have a word in private. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=53.96s)]
*  The Oscar-winning movie Conclave released six months ago [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=56.84s)]
*  painstakingly recreated the papal election process as the backdrop for a story of raw politics in red robes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=60.68s)]
*  This is a conclave Aldo. It's not a war. It is a war. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=67.72s)]
*  It won't be quite like that, but there might be battles. Will the new pope share Francis's progressive ideas or will more traditional voices hold sway? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=72.72s)]
*  Among three English cardinals with a vote, Vincent Nichols advises to expect the unexpected. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=81.24s)]
*  It's always a surprise. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=87.4s)]
*  While the film the Conclave obviously made great drama of this, it'll be far more an exercise of corporate discernment [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=89.4s)]
*  and trusting in the promptings of this Holy Spirit to give us what we need. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=99.64s)]
*  80% of those voting in the Conclave were appointed by Pope Francis, but his picks reflect both ideology and geography. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=105.88s)]
*  European cardinals used to dominate. Now they represent just 39% of those in the Conclave. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=113.24s)]
*  17% are from Asia, 13% from South America and from Africa. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=119.48s)]
*  Now in Ghana, they hope Peter Tuckson might be the first black pope since the early days of Christianity. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=124.68s)]
*  Many Filipino Catholics will be praying the Archbishop of Manila, Louis Taglay, becomes a rare Asian pope. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=130.84s)]
*  The Hungarian, Peter Erdo, is a leading conservative candidate, while Italian Pietro Parolin is seen as more of a continuity pope. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=138.84s)]
*  What we are praying for is not for an African pope, a black pope, an American pope, an Asian pope. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=146.84s)]
*  No, we are praying for a good and holy pope. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=157.0s)]
*  Cardinals will vote twice a day until one name gets two-thirds of the votes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=161.0s)]
*  While it remains undecided the slips are burned with a chemical to make black smoke. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=167.0s)]
*  Conclave remains in session until white smoke signals a new pope has been found. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=171.0s)]
*  Mark Easton, BBC News. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vqVCJJTDE&t=177.0s)]
