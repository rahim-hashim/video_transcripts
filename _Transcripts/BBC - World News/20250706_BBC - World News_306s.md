Video Description: Israel has decided to send a delegation to Qatar on Sunday for proximity talks with Hamas on the latest proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office described the changes that Hamas wanted to make to a plan, presented by mediators from Qatar, the US and Egypt, as “unacceptable”.
 
On Friday, Hamas said it had delivered a "positive response" to the proposal for a 60-day ceasefire and that it was ready for negotiations. However, a Palestinian official said the group had sought amendments including a guarantee that hostilities would not resume if talks on a permanent truce failed.

# Israel and Hamas to hold indirect talks | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [July 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw)
*  Indirect talks are to take place between Israel and Hamas today as negotiations intensify [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=0.0s)]
*  to try and reach a possible ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=5.48s)]
*  Even though discussions in Qatar are set to go ahead, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=10.52s)]
*  Netanyahu has cast doubt over whether a deal can be achieved after he described the proposed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  changes from Hamas to President Trump's 60-day truce as unacceptable. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=19.56s)]
*  Mr. Netanyahu is due to meet Donald Trump at the White House on Monday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=24.52s)]
*  Ioni Wells is in Jerusalem for us and told us what hope there is of a breakthrough for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=28.76s)]
*  a ceasefire on the ceasefire negotiations. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=33.44s)]
*  Well, at the moment it still seems like there are significant gaps for mediators to bridge. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=35.64s)]
*  The biggest chasm really that's still existing is that Hamas want a US guarantee that after [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=42.08s)]
*  any 60-day ceasefire, the fighting in Gaza will end. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=49.44s)]
*  This is something which Israel has so far rejected in previous negotiations, but Hamas [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=53.84s)]
*  wants essentially a commitment that the war will end after the period of a ceasefire if [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=59.32000000000001s)]
*  a more permanent deal isn't agreed by the end of that 60 days. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=63.88s)]
*  Hamas also is requesting a change to the aid provision in Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  It wants an end to the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and a resumption [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=73.28s)]
*  of aid provided through the UN and other providers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Again, this is likely to prove pretty controversial with the Israelis because the Israelis have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  repeatedly accused Hamas of stealing aid provided by international relief organisations and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=86.2s)]
*  certainly I think from their perspective if they were to concede on this front, it would [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=91.36s)]
*  seem like a concession being given, which could be politically difficult for Benjamin [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=96.0s)]
*  Netanyahu as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=100.04s)]
*  Finally, Hamas are also seeking Israel to withdraw its troops to positions they held [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=101.84s)]
*  before the last ceasefire collapse in March. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  Again, something which perhaps politically might be difficult for the Israeli side to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=111.28s)]
*  concede to given some of the pressures, particularly on Benjamin Netanyahu from the far-right members [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  of his cabinet who do not want him to end the war in Gaza, but also if anything want [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=119.92s)]
*  an escalation and an intensifying of the military efforts of Israel in Gaza at the moment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  So these talks are set to continue, but it does look like the same sticking points remain [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=132.72s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's office has been clear that from Israel's perspective, the demands [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=137.32000000000002s)]
*  Hamas are making are unacceptable, although both sides are saying that they are willing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=141.8s)]
*  to negotiate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Still some really difficult issues to overcome then, but Donald Trump has been very much [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=147.8s)]
*  talking up the possibility of there being a deal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  Is he being overly optimistic? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=155.4s)]
*  Is this just him being talking that up to quite a great degree? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  Certainly Donald Trump wants to see progress and I think the fact that both sides have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=161.64s)]
*  agreed to enter into negotiations through mediators is something which Donald Trump [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=170.72s)]
*  can talk about on Monday as progress. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  Whether or not it leads to substantial progress though is a question we still don't really [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=178.48s)]
*  know the answer to because it seems like these sticking points are still existing, particularly [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=181.92s)]
*  this one about Hamas wanting a guarantee that the war will end. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=186.76s)]
*  Israel so far refusing to give that commitment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=191.28s)]
*  Hamas is seeking specifically a US guarantee of that, which seems to be a message to Donald [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=193.64s)]
*  Trump ahead of his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if the US gives such [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=199.2s)]
*  a guarantee, then Hamas would be prepared potentially to agree to this ceasefire. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  So I think Hamas' demand there seems to be a direct call essentially to Donald Trump [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=208.64s)]
*  ahead of this meeting, but it does seem as I say that there isn't necessarily a sign [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=213.28s)]
*  Israel will accept that right now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  And meanwhile of course the loss of life continues doesn't it and the controversy over getting [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=220.56s)]
*  aid to people, what's the latest been in Gaza? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=226.12s)]
*  That's right, as ever with these ceasefire negotiations people die while they're going [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=232.0s)]
*  on and that is a concern to people on the ground, particularly in Israel here where [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  it seems the majority of the population according to polls do want this war to end. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=242.76s)]
*  In Gaza the Hamas run civil defence say at least 35 Palestinians were killed on Saturday [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  as a result of Israeli airstrikes and gunfire. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=254.2s)]
*  Seven were killed in an attack that hit Al Mawasi, which is an area that is supposed to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=257.76s)]
*  be safe according to Israel. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=263.0s)]
*  It's an area that people are told to evacuate to but has been subjected to strikes over [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  the last couple of days. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=268.84s)]
*  Seven people there were killed including a doctor and his children. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=270.52s)]
*  Two American employees of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation who are providing aid now in Gaza [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=275.8s)]
*  have also been reportedly wounded in what the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation have described [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=282.2s)]
*  as a grenade attack. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=286.76s)]
*  They and the Israelis have blamed Hamas for that attack although Hamas haven't commented [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=288.76s)]
*  specifically in response to that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=294.6s)]
*  But clearly as you say there are ongoing injuries, deaths on both sides of this war as these [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=296.72s)]
*  negotiations continue. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=302.52s)]
*  Hione Wells there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ-OKohRuLw&t=304.8s)]
