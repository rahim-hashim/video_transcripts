# Dozens killed as Syrian security forces clash with Assad loyalists | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY)
*  More from Syria and Syrian government security forces have been carrying out what they say is a big operation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=0.0s)]
*  to crush an insurgency by fighters loyal to the ousted president Bashar al-Assad in coastal areas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  It is the biggest challenge yet to the new Islamist-led government in Syria and a curfew has been imposed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=13.8s)]
*  in the port cities of Latakia and Tartus. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=20.2s)]
*  A monitoring group, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=23.0s)]
*  says dozens of people may have been killed by Syrian security forces with some unconfirmed claims of summary executions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=26.8s)]
*  Well, the interim government has sent reinforcements to Latakia, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  which is an area dominated by the Alawites community loyal to the former president. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  Here's our Middle East correspondent, Hugo Bishagher, with the latest developments on the situation there in Syria. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=44.8s)]
*  So this is the worst violence that we've seen in Syria since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad back in December [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=51.0s)]
*  after that Islamist-led rebel offensive. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=57.0s)]
*  Now, let me just give you an idea of what's happening, because yesterday security forces were carrying out [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  an operation in the region of Latakia on the Mediterranean coast, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=68.0s)]
*  and they say that this was an operation targeting a senior official in the Assad regime. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=74.0s)]
*  They say there was an ambush by forces loyal to President Assad. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=80.6s)]
*  A local security official described this as a very sophisticated, well-planned attack. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=86.8s)]
*  Clashes followed. There were confrontations then in other parts of the coast. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=94.6s)]
*  And today what we're seeing is what the authorities are describing as a huge security operation [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  targeting forces loyal to the Assad regime. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=105.8s)]
*  Now we're hearing those reports of dozens of people killed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=110.2s)]
*  This is an area where, you know, it's the stronghold of President Bashar al-Assad's family, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  and it is also the heartland of the Alawite community, President Assad, his family. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  They come from this minority. They have been accusing the new leaders in Syria of targeting them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=124.8s)]
*  They say that they've been suffering attacks, abuse, and our reports that some members of the community have also been killed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=131.0s)]
*  So that gives us a snapshot of the tensions in Syria, a country that continues to be deeply divided, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=140.0s)]
*  deeply fractured among different sects and factions. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=146.4s)]
*  And just in terms of those unconfirmed claims of summary executions, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=151.8s)]
*  I mean, is there any evidence to substantiate that at the moment? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=157.4s)]
*  Yeah, so we've heard from the monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=163.8s)]
*  saying that activists have released footage of dozens of bodies of men and boys wearing civilian clothing outside a house in Latakia. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=168.6s)]
*  We've seen at least one of those videos, you know, graphic footage, really. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=180.6s)]
*  We haven't been able to independently verify the authenticity of this footage, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=186.6s)]
*  but this comes amid these operations happening in Latakia, again, a stronghold of the Assad family. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=190.8s)]
*  And again, this is something that the Alawite community has been saying since day one, really, of this new government in Syria, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=200.10000000000002s)]
*  since, you know, the fall of the Assad regime, that they have been targeted by the members of this new government or groups associated with the new authorities in Syria. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  And now these claims of violence, of executions that have happened in Latakia, including members of this community. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dx4O4PjivY&t=219.2s)]
