Video Description: US President Donald Trump has announced in his State of the Union speech that he will hold a second nuclear summit with North Korea's leader this month.
In an address to the nation with the theme "Choosing Greatness", he vowed once again to build a border wall.
While appealing for political unity, the Republican president also said "ridiculous partisan investigations" could damage US prosperity.
In a rebuttal, Democrats accused Mr Trump of abandoning US values.
His primetime address came less than a fortnight after he backed down to end the longest ever US government shutdown when Democrats refused to fund a US-Mexico border wall.
