Video Description: In the tiny city of Escobares, Texas, 62% of residents live below the poverty line.
That's the highest rate of any US city with more than 1,000 people, according to the 2016 US Census Bureau survey.
Directly on the US-Mexico border, the city struggles with crime and unemployment.
But local officials say they're trying hard to lift Escobares out of the cycle of poverty.

# Life in the poorest city in the US - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 11, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg)
*  There's not much of a future here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=0.0s)]
*  The border between Mexico and the United States, it's this. This is it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=7.0s)]
*  It's kind of difficult because of the jobs. There's not too many here in Mescovalles, so we're kind of going down. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=30.0s)]
*  This is the border between the United States and Mexico. See how peaceful it is now? You can hear the birds chirping. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=60.0s)]
*  It wasn't always the border. It is now because of some treaty that happened somewhere in our history. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=87.0s)]
*  And every time you have a border, you're going to have problems because the people on this side are going to say, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=97.0s)]
*  it's illegal to bring this and this and that. And the people on the other side are going to say, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=103.0s)]
*  well, it's illegal to bring those things over here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=107.0s)]
*  This is what it's like to live here on the border. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=113.0s)]
*  Here it became a city, but my life hasn't changed much. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=117.0s)]
*  There's a lot of need in this area, and a lot of crime. You can hear gunshots. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=142.0s)]
*  There are no jobs here. Everyone is complaining about it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=156.0s)]
*  There's no food. But thank God I have a family that has given me food. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=161.0s)]
*  The employment opportunities are very limited. We don't have any other big industries here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=171.0s)]
*  We hope someday somebody will see the opportunity to come here and set up a big company of some sort [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=176.0s)]
*  where our people can have a job. That is our biggest dream. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PsRRK0xitg&t=184.0s)]
