**BBC - World News:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw)
*  Hello, I'm Regina Ivaidinath and welcome to BBC News Now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=0.0s)]
*  Nearly 100 people have been killed in Gaza after another intense wave [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=4.0s)]
*  of Israeli strikes in the north of the territory, authorities there say. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=9.0s)]
*  Well, it comes as Israel pledged to launch a major offensive [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=13.0s)]
*  and re-occupy all of Gaza if a deal with Hamas wasn't agreed by the end of the week. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=17.0s)]
*  Well, President Trump's visit to the region is wrapping up now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=23.0s)]
*  Local reports say Israel's military launched a large-scale ground, air and sea assault [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=27.0s)]
*  early on Friday on the town of Bethlehem in the far northwestern corner of the territory. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=33.0s)]
*  Well, the assault began with smoke bomb barrages, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=39.0s)]
*  followed by intense artillery shelling from nearby Israeli positions. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=42.0s)]
*  Well, our Gaza correspondent says this is the most extensive ground assault [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=47.0s)]
*  on northern Gaza since Israel resumed its offensive in early March. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=51.0s)]
*  Gaza's health ministry says 2,876 people have been killed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=56.0s)]
*  since those strikes were resumed by Israel on the 18th of March. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=62.0s)]
*  That now takes the total number killed in Gaza during the conflict to more than 53,000. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=66.0s)]
*  These people witnessed today's actions in Bethlehem. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=73.0s)]
*  They were innocent people taken by a sudden strike. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=77.0s)]
*  Only their remains left, as you see. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=82.0s)]
*  They were my sisters and daughters. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=85.0s)]
*  Those who do not die from the bombing will die of hunger. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=88.0s)]
*  We were sleeping and the houses were full of children, women and displaced people [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=92.0s)]
*  whose homes had been destroyed and now living in tents. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=97.0s)]
*  Suddenly, at 1.30am and without prior warning, they bombed a house. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=100.0s)]
*  Many children and women were killed and their bodies scattered in the streets. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=104.0s)]
*  If you're on the ground from Bethlehem, well, these strikes come as indirect talks [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=109.0s)]
*  on a ceasefire and hostage release deal, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=114.0s)]
*  while continuing between Israel and Hamas in Qatar, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=116.0s)]
*  with Israel having stopped deliveries of aid and other supplies to Gaza since March. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=119.0s)]
*  Let's have a listen to President Trump talking about the situation there [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=124.0s)]
*  a short while ago on his trip to the region. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=127.0s)]
*  We're looking at Gaza and we've got to get that taken care of. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=130.0s)]
*  A lot of people are starving, a lot of people are... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=133.0s)]
*  There's a lot of bad things going on, OK? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=136.0s)]
*  President Trump there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=138.0s)]
*  Well, let's speak now to Franz Lewis, the emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=140.0s)]
*  who's in Almawasi in Gaza. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=146.0s)]
*  Welcome to BBC News. We, of course, appreciate you taking the time to talk to us. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=149.0s)]
*  Just tell us about the situation as you see it, where you are. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=154.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. It's not the third time I'm here in Gaza. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=158.0s)]
*  And although the situation here has been catastrophic over the past 19 months, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=163.0s)]
*  the situation since the resumption of the war has just getting worse by the day. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=169.0s)]
*  People being forcibly displaced. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=176.0s)]
*  We talk about more than 400,000 people being displaced. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=180.0s)]
*  Continued repeated evacuation orders with the population nowhere to go. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=184.0s)]
*  Civilian structures being hit, hospitals included, hospitals and health centres being taken out of service. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=190.0s)]
*  So, situation for Palestinians and those trying to help in Gaza has become hell. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=200.0s)]
*  You describe it quite starkly there, don't you, Franz? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=209.0s)]
*  And of course, all of this is that aid blockade by Israel continues on, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=213.0s)]
*  which means that fresh supplies can't come in to the people who need them most. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=217.0s)]
*  What do you make of all of that? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=224.0s)]
*  And if you don't get supplies, how bad is it going to get in a situation that's already dire? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=226.0s)]
*  One need to mention it's now the ninth week we're in without supplies getting into the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=235.0s)]
*  Food is running low. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=242.0s)]
*  Our colleagues and families and patients telling us that they have hardly food left for one meal a day. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=245.0s)]
*  Our medical supplies are running low. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=253.0s)]
*  The fuel is getting dangerous low. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=256.0s)]
*  Fuel needed for the ambulances, fuel needed for the generators of the hospitals, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=258.0s)]
*  to run the intensive care units, to run the incubators of the new forms. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=266.0s)]
*  We're running with light speed towards the abyss, towards this humanitarian abyss. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=273.0s)]
*  And the moment will come if there isn't any change. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=281.0s)]
*  The soonest, they will need to shut down the generators and the incubators and the intensive care units here in Gaza. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=286.0s)]
*  How worried are the people that you're working with and that you talk to about this new offensive that Israel has now promised and it looks like it's now begun? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=300.0s)]
*  That's a personal question as well. How safe do you yourself feel? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=312.0s)]
*  To start with your last questions, I think we all need to understand that there is no safe place here in Gaza. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=316.0s)]
*  And this was like that since the very first day. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=327.0s)]
*  That's why I do personally consider it as cynical as well if no evacuation orders being placed and shared with the population, asking them to leave to safe areas where there is no safe area to go to. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=332.0s)]
*  Our colleagues, the population we serve, they're desperate. They're tired. They're exhausted. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=353.0s)]
*  Yesterday I'm passing by one of our health centers, the medical lead there, the nursing supervisor, he told me, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=363.0s)]
*  And I'm desperate. It's breaking my heart. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=373.0s)]
*  Turning a mother away, which is bludgeoning to have her kid included in our nutritional program. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=379.0s)]
*  But I had to say no, because they would not yet meet the criteria. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=387.0s)]
*  But I do know with no food getting in and hardly having enough, the kid would fit the criteria in a week. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=392.0s)]
*  And this is the daily decisions our teams have to have to take. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=402.0s)]
*  And again, we call upon all the international community, the Israeli authorities to end that collective punishment of Palestinians and use humanitarian aid to use food as a weapon of war. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=409.0s)]
*  OK, thank you so much for sharing your story. Frank Luiz, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, speaking to us from Almawasi. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ips8a951Tw&t=429.0s)]
