# El Helicoide: The Shopping Mall That Became A Torture Prison - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 30, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk)
*  In the heart of the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, is one of the country's most notorious prisons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=0.0s)]
*  Hundreds are packed inside the Space Age building, where criminals live alongside political prisoners. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=10.0s)]
*  There have been reports of horrific human rights abuses. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=18.0s)]
*  I've been speaking to former prisoners and guards to find out what's really going on inside the Lelicoide, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=31.0s)]
*  and to understand what it tells us about Venezuela's catastrophic decline [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=38.0s)]
*  from Latin American powerhouse to economic disaster zone. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=43.0s)]
*  The Lelicoide [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=47.0s)]
*  Recent years have seen Venezuela spiral into chaos. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=59.0s)]
*  In 2014 and 2017, massive anti-government protests rocked the country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=63.0s)]
*  After 15 years of revolutionary socialist rule on the president Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=71.0s)]
*  the economy was in ruins. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=78.0s)]
*  Venezuelans were facing hyperinflation, food shortages, and soaring crime. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=85.0s)]
*  The protesters were met by riot police, and thousands were arrested. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=91.0s)]
*  Many were brought to the headquarters of the feared Venezuelan secret police, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=96.0s)]
*  a building whose extraordinary history mirrors that of Venezuela itself. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=102.0s)]
*  This is an absolutely iconic building across the whole of Latin America. There's really nothing like it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=113.0s)]
*  This is a building that was supposed to be a 300-store spiral shopping mall. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=119.0s)]
*  This is huge. This is really big. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=127.0s)]
*  Cars were supposed to circulate up these ramps, up to the top. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=130.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be visible from any point in the valley of Correca Sway. It makes an indelible mark. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=135.0s)]
*  El Helicoide, named after its spiral helicoid structure, was designed in the 1950s. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=141.0s)]
*  Can you explain what the political and social context of Venezuela was back then? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=148.0s)]
*  Venezuela in the 1950s is a country experiencing profound change. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=154.0s)]
*  The political and social context of Venezuela was a political and social context. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=162.0s)]
*  It was a country experiencing profound change. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=168.0s)]
*  Globally, we're seeing the kind of post-World War II reconstruction, and Venezuelan oil, the industry, was booming. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=174.0s)]
*  There was a real investment in this idea of instant modernity. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=183.0s)]
*  It is a country that from 1948 has entered a period of military dictatorship, and the mandate was, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=187.0s)]
*  The brochures boasted that you had the equivalent of all of the other stores in most of the city in one place. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=194.0s)]
*  So you get people dancing, people shopping, there were cinemas, there was a hotel and a club, rows and rows and rows of different stores. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=203.0s)]
*  It was going to be a shop window for everything that Venezuela could have been. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=211.0s)]
*  But in 1958, the regime was overthrown. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=216.0s)]
*  Work on an helicoide stalled, just months from completion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=220.0s)]
*  This is really the fundamental fracture in the building's history and when it becomes abandoned. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=224.0s)]
*  After 1982, the state still doesn't know what to do with this white elephant. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=231.0s)]
*  So a decision is made to give two of the floors to the intelligence police. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=237.0s)]
*  For more than three decades, el helicoide has housed the headquarters of the Venezuelan intelligence service, now known as the SEBIN. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=243.0s)]
*  Today it's hard to find any dream in el helicoide. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=253.0s)]
*  The building reflects this downward spiral of fortunes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=257.0s)]
*  It's a modern icon sitting inside a sea of shanty towns. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=262.0s)]
*  What we are confronted with is economic decline, political polarization, authoritarianism, embedded in this building that has had an absolute 180 degree change in fortunes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=267.0s)]
*  Roswith Mantilla is someone who knows the building well. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=285.0s)]
*  A well known LGBT rights and political activist, he was arrested during the 2014 protests and accused of helping finance them, a charge he denies. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=288.0s)]
*  As the demonstrations continued, more and more prisoners were being brought to el helicoide. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=319.0s)]
*  Freedom! Freedom! [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=328.0s)]
*  In May 2014, I think we didn't get to 50 prisoners in the SEBIN facilities. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=334.0s)]
*  We were already in a tight spot. After two years in prison, it increased to 300. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=340.0s)]
*  And we can't reveal their identities because they fear government reprisals against their families. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=357.0s)]
*  Their names and voices have been changed and they have both since left the security service. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=364.0s)]
*  Without any evidence. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=387.0s)]
*  Which is illegal? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=417.0s)]
*  Which is illegal. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=418.0s)]
*  They were left there and then released, as a form of punishment. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=420.0s)]
*  They made mistakes. There are people who really had nothing to do with the protests. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=429.0s)]
*  The goal of taking everyone arrested was to scare and scare people. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=435.0s)]
*  And I think that in some way they did it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=442.0s)]
*  Nowadays, when a protest or march is called, I know that there are many people who are afraid. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=445.0s)]
*  One of the reasons is that they don't want to be arrested. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=454.0s)]
*  The SEBIN is an organization that has to generate intelligence and information among its missions. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=458.0s)]
*  But for a while, as we know, that wasn't its function. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=466.0s)]
*  Its function has been to defend a regime, a dictatorship. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=471.0s)]
*  And it has been to protect the people of the country. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=476.0s)]
*  And it has been to protect the people of the country. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=480.0s)]
*  Its function has been to defend a regime, a dictatorship. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=483.0s)]
*  That is the mission of the SEBIN right now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=488.0s)]
*  I could see from an office, a office, a cell. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=506.0s)]
*  It didn't matter how many meters, what mattered was the number of people who could enter that room. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=511.0s)]
*  The room that had been pushed 100, they were going to put 100 there. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=518.0s)]
*  Stairs that were sealed, stairs, imagine the stairs of an emergency hotel. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=524.0s)]
*  The stairs that are generally small and low light. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=533.0s)]
*  The prisoners had names for each of these improvised cells. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=535.0s)]
*  The fish tank, little tiger and little hell. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=541.0s)]
*  But the most feared of them all was called Guantanamo. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=546.0s)]
*  Two old offices that were joined to recruit people in extreme conditions. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=550.0s)]
*  Without light, without water, without bathroom, without any kind of toilet, without beds. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=556.0s)]
*  They were sheets and mattresses on the floor. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=561.0s)]
*  It could have been 12, 15 meters. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=565.0s)]
*  There they slept approximately 50, 60 prisoners. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=570.0s)]
*  The living conditions were obviously terrible. They were the worst. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=576.0s)]
*  A prisoner can go to Guantanamo, he can spend about 8 days, 15 days without a bath. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=591.0s)]
*  Doing necessities in water pots and doing fecal necessities in plastic bags. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=599.0s)]
*  And there they rot. So imagine 15 days in a cell with food, with fecal necessities. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=605.0s)]
*  People without a bath, without being able to sit for many days. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=612.0s)]
*  With so many arrests, there was intense pressure on the guards to secure a confession, whatever the cost. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=615.0s)]
*  When they were going to interrogate someone, they took out thick, transparent bags. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=624.0s)]
*  And with that they suffocated him to get information. They put them on his face. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=632.0s)]
*  They told them, tell him what you have to say to stop suffering. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=637.0s)]
*  Speak, because you are already down. Do it because you are already in prison. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=642.0s)]
*  What are you going to prison for? You are going to prison. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=647.0s)]
*  The devices that have power, those that are for personal defense, they were put anywhere in the body. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=650.0s)]
*  Like in the neck, also in the feet, the ribs, even in their feet. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=658.0s)]
*  The detainee, the criminal, they put his hands behind him, like this, tied up. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=664.0s)]
*  The feet also tied up. And with the arms behind, they raised the rope with which they had tied him to a beam, metal, something like that, making a pole. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=673.0s)]
*  And how long could these methods of torture last? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=685.0s)]
*  The time that could last depended on the detainee. Not everyone had the same physical conditions. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=689.0s)]
*  They did not have the same strength. They did not have the same age. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=696.0s)]
*  Many times the torture was such that the detainee, to whom they were torturing, proceeded to tell lies. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=701.0s)]
*  Or to say what the official wanted to hear, just so that the detainee could hear them. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=709.0s)]
*  They would go to the attorney general to verify the health of the detainees. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=716.0s)]
*  And the police threatened the attorneys not to put in the forensic records that the people had been mistreated. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=722.0s)]
*  And they put in a healthy adult in front of a person who could barely stand. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=730.0s)]
*  It was something systematic. When I was there, it was not very reasonable. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=735.0s)]
*  When I was there, it was not very regular for that to happen to me. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=743.0s)]
*  Because I was part of the percentage of officials who did not agree with that situation. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=749.0s)]
*  And we knew that at some point that could lead to a criminal and judicial problem. And we had to take care of that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=756.0s)]
*  It was assumed as something normal. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=766.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=768.0s)]
*  So you were not involved? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=770.0s)]
*  The reason I ask you is because there were some detainees who had said that they were still involved in certain beatings. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=772.0s)]
*  There are many detainees who will have their version of what happened. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=780.0s)]
*  Yes, I know they mistreated them. To accuse someone you have to have evidence. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=785.0s)]
*  So it is very difficult for someone to name me. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=792.0s)]
*  If there is, well, he will have his reasons. But he needs irrefutable evidence that this really happened. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=796.0s)]
*  The pilot was a very polite person. He was given the rules of the helicopter and he followed them. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=826.0s)]
*  The only thing he was bothered with was his medicine. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=841.0s)]
*  Where he was allegedly told he would face certain death at the hands of the drug gangs, kidnappers and other violent offenders running the place. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=856.0s)]
*  The psychological pressure at that moment was such that he decided to take his life. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=866.0s)]
*  He was locked in his cell for three days of intense psychological torture that we had every day. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=874.0s)]
*  Hours after they took out the body, they destroyed everything. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=880.0s)]
*  Rosmit's imprisonment ended abruptly when in 2016 he fell seriously ill. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=891.0s)]
*  A judge authorizes transfer to a clinic, but at the last moment, Dicevin intervened. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=899.0s)]
*  I saw a video on social media, when they took me out of the clinic and put me in a patrol. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=910.0s)]
*  They locked me in, they didn't let me go back to the doctor to be operated on. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=918.0s)]
*  Because I publicly told them at that moment that they took me out of the operating room, that I was a murderer. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=922.0s)]
*  In revenge, they were letting me die. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=932.0s)]
*  They put me in an improvised cell, which was usually an office. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=940.0s)]
*  Wet, dark, with rats, cockroaches. They put a mattress on the dirty, rotten floor. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=946.0s)]
*  I was there for ten days. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=957.0s)]
*  Every day they would tell me that people like me deserved that place. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=959.0s)]
*  That politicians like me deserved that place. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=964.0s)]
*  It was simply to mentally diminish myself, mentally mistreat myself, mentally torture myself. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=968.0s)]
*  That happened during those ten days. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=975.0s)]
*  I saw a doctor, I assume he was a doctor, he identified himself, and he wanted to persuade the diagnosis. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=978.0s)]
*  He made a report saying that I was perfectly healthy, and he forced me to sign it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=986.0s)]
*  I signed it, and it was all a lie. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=990.0s)]
*  Until the tenth day, thanks to the international pressure, the UN's amnesty and the political pollution in my country, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=995.0s)]
*  I was transferred to the military hospital and I was operated on. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1002.0s)]
*  Rosmit was already a prominent political activist when he was jailed. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1007.0s)]
*  But while he was in El Helicoide, he won a seat in the Venezuelan National Assembly. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1012.0s)]
*  Days after his release from prison, in November 2016, he was sworn into Congress, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1018.0s)]
*  becoming the country's first openly gay congressman. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1024.0s)]
*  And he began testifying about what he had seen and experienced in El Helicoide. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1028.0s)]
*  After Rosmit left El Helicoide, the situation continued to deteriorate. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1033.0s)]
*  And in May 2018, inmates took control of the prison, demanding better conditions and freedom. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1039.0s)]
*  We are tired of people still torturing us. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1053.0s)]
*  We are tired of people still torturing us. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1056.0s)]
*  We are tired of people still torturing us. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1059.0s)]
*  We are tired of people still torturing us. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1062.0s)]
*  We are tired of people still torturing us. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1065.0s)]
*  In this prison, a young man who has not been sentenced, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1071.0s)]
*  kidnapped by the government of Nicolás Maduro, here is the consequence. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1075.0s)]
*  I made a promise to release them. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1082.0s)]
*  I made a promise to release them. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1084.0s)]
*  Then I realized that it was not in my hands. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1086.0s)]
*  In my hands is to show what happens to make the world more sensitive and that the world helps us. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1088.0s)]
*  But it was not in my hands to open the door of the prison. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1092.0s)]
*  Security officials regained control shortly after, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1099.0s)]
*  and many prisoners were released or transferred to other prisons. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1102.0s)]
*  According to former prisoners, around 150 are currently detained at the jail. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1107.0s)]
*  But while the country remains in turmoil, the question remains. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1113.0s)]
*  When will the Helicoide reach breaking point once again? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1117.0s)]
*  On the outside, Venezuela continues to descend further into crisis. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1125.0s)]
*  At the end of 2018, inflation had risen to more than 1 million percent. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1131.0s)]
*  Many Venezuelans are struggling to afford even basic items, such as food and toiletries. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1139.0s)]
*  And those who can face never-ending queues. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1146.0s)]
*  Public services like schools and transport are breaking down, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1152.0s)]
*  and hospitals are running short of life-saving drugs. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1156.0s)]
*  More than 3 million desperate Venezuelans have left the country, hoping to find a better life. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1162.0s)]
*  Among them are Manuel and Victor, the two Helicoide guards. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1169.0s)]
*  They left. I don't know if they're going to have dinner, because there's no food. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1186.0s)]
*  Right now, the people, the family, who can help me eat in Venezuela [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1192.0s)]
*  is because a relative is out of the country and is sending money to help them. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1197.0s)]
*  Venezuela really has to open its eyes, it has to act. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1204.0s)]
*  I know I'm far away, but believe me, I'll give all my support to make sure that goes away. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1208.0s)]
*  I want that government to change, that Venezuela is better. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1213.0s)]
*  Rosmit has also left the country. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1221.0s)]
*  In 2017, he was granted asylum in France, where he continues to campaign for change in Venezuela. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1224.0s)]
*  But for him, and for many former inmates, the Helicoide continues to cast a long shadow. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1231.0s)]
*  No matter how much I run and move from continent to continent, I'll always be able to make it. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1239.0s)]
*  The Helicoide was my home for two and a half years. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1245.0s)]
*  And even though I refused, many of me stayed in there. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1248.0s)]
*  I have a commitment to my country, I am a congressman, I am an activist for human rights. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1253.0s)]
*  And not being able to be there in Venezuela at this moment is so important, it's a way to continue being a prisoner. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1256.0s)]
*  The Helicoide [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1268.0s)]
*  The Helicoide [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3t-AtDuWk&t=1298.0s)]
