Video Description: India has suspended the Indian Premier League - the world's richest cricket tournament - for a week amid escalating tensions with Pakistan.
 
Officials took the decision after a match was abandoned as military exchanges between the two countries continued for a third day.
 
Pakistani authorities said 31 people have been killed and 57 injured by Indian air strikes in the country and Pakistan-administered Kashmir since Wednesday morning.
 
Twenty-six civilians were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir last month and India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants behind the attack - an allegation the neighbouring country has rejected.

# India suspends IPL cricket for one week over safety concerns | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw)
*  Next, one of the world's most lucrative sporting tournaments, the Indian Premier League or IPL, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=0.0s)]
*  has been suspended for at least a week because of the deadly conflict with Pakistan. The decision [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=4.96s)]
*  to halt the cricket competition comes after a match in northern India was abandoned. There [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=10.88s)]
*  was rocket attacks in the region. Pakistan has relocated its own cricket league to the Middle East. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=16.56s)]
*  Delhi and Islamabad are continuing to blame each other for escalating military tensions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=23.04s)]
*  And more than 50 people now have been killed on both sides of the border since Wednesday, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=28.56s)]
*  the worst violence in decades between the South Asian neighbours. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=35.04s)]
*  Speak to our correspondent, Arunadeh Mukherjee, in Delhi. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=39.84s)]
*  First of all, Arunadeh, what do we know about the suspension of the IPL there? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=43.52s)]
*  Well, I'm currently, Lewis, at one of the stadiums here in Delhi. It's called the Arun Jaitley Stadium [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=52.56s)]
*  and this is a stadium which has hosted numerous IPL matches in the recent past. And in fact, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=58.24s)]
*  there was another match that was slated to take place on the 11th of May. Team posters are up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  In fact, when we were driving past from that side, which I can't show you, there were several [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=67.28s)]
*  posters. The barricades are already in place from where they would have ordinarily directed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  a lot of the crowds which would have come on the 11th of May to actually watch that match on match [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  day. But it obviously is now bearing a completely deserted look and it is likely to be this way for [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=79.92s)]
*  the next one week because of that decision taken by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=84.56s)]
*  This is very significant because not only does it signify and indicate the rising tensions between [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=90.64s)]
*  India and Pakistan, the IPL is one of the most popular cricketing league tournaments here in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=96.64s)]
*  the country, attracting several foreign players, including coaching staff as well as commentators. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=102.4s)]
*  It is watched by millions of people around the world and it is a big money spinning event. In [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=109.44s)]
*  fact, it also in a sense involves Bollywood because it has teams which are owned by big superstars [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=115.44s)]
*  like Shah Rukh Khan. It has teams which are owned by big wigs and big industrialists like Mukesh Ambani. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=121.84s)]
*  So that's what the IPL is all about. So in fact, in many ways, it is right up there with the, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=127.52s)]
*  for instance, the NFL in the US or even the Premier League in England, just to give you a sense of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=133.52s)]
*  what IPL craze is like over here. So it is certainly a cause of concern and there was a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=137.92s)]
*  big security concern last evening on Thursday, as you mentioned, in the city of Dharamshala in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=142.16s)]
*  northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh when a match was taking place, but it had to be abandoned [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=146.56s)]
*  because just less than 200 kilometers away from that city in a neighboring state, there were [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  reports of missile and drone attacks. So that's the kind of security scare that there is. We are [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=155.92s)]
*  also getting reports that some foreign players have decided to leave. We don't know what is going [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=161.27999999999997s)]
*  to happen after one week, whether there will be a reassessment, but it all depends on what the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=166.8s)]
*  situation, how the situation unfolds in the next one week. And just talk us through the state of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=170.08s)]
*  the tensions between the two countries right now. Well, the situation is very, very tense, even as [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  we speak. India, remember, issued a statement saying that they had neutralized missile and drone [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=187.36s)]
*  attacks which are targeted some military installations in two cities of India, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=196.16s)]
*  administered Kashmir, namely Jammu as well as Odenpur and one city in the northern Indian [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  state of Punjab called Patankot. These are all cities which are close to the international border. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=204.16s)]
*  India said they had suffered no losses. They also accused Pakistan of resorting to ceasefire [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=208.8s)]
*  violations along the line of control, which is the de facto border dividing Indian and Pakistani [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=213.28s)]
*  administered Kashmir. Pakistan, of course, has denied all these allegations, saying this is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=217.76s)]
*  mere propaganda by India trying to malign Pakistan, asking the international community [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=221.84s)]
*  to take note of the developments here. We've also been hearing increasing calls to urge restraint [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=226.96s)]
*  for both the nuclear armed neighbors, the US, the UK, the UN repeatedly saying that we would like to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=233.52s)]
*  see things de-escalate as quickly as possible. But the situation is still very, very fluid. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=238.16s)]
*  India's government has been very clear that whatever they are doing is in response to the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=243.28s)]
*  kind of shelling and what they call our attacks coming in from Pakistan. They've said that this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=249.36s)]
*  is a measured, proportionate and an equal response in the same domain as Pakistan. India continues [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  to say that they are committed to peace, but they will not tolerate any kind of, quote, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=260.8s)]
*  misadventures by the Pakistani military. Arunade, thank you for that. Well, there's been overnight [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=264.4s)]
*  firing and shelling across the border between India and Pakistan, administered Kashmir. The [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=269.84s)]
*  BUC's Farhad Javad is in Muzaffarabad. As tension climbs between India and Pakistan, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=274.64s)]
*  so do the consequences. The latest reports we are getting here are that several international [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=280.96s)]
*  airlines are suspending their operations in Pakistan due to this ongoing conflict in the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=286.0s)]
*  region. I was in Muzaffarabad last night, which is the capital of Pakistan, administered Kashmir, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  and it wasn't a quiet night at all. From our hotel window, we could actually see artillery fire [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=297.12s)]
*  lighting up the sky and people were really worried. This firing and shelling continued [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=302.88s)]
*  well into night in several sectors across line of control in Pakistan, administered Kashmir. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=307.44s)]
*  The latest reports that we are getting from the government of Pakistan, administered Kashmir, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=313.04s)]
*  it says that during last night cross-border shelling and firing, six people were killed [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=317.6s)]
*  and 29 others were injured. So far in last two days, the total number of death toll in Pakistan, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=324.24s)]
*  administered Kashmir, has reached 17 and 51 people are injured, whereas there is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=330.16s)]
*  lots of properties are either partially damaged or they are completely damaged in several such [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  sectors. The government says that during this firing and shelling last night, a 40-days-old [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=342.8s)]
*  baby and a newlywed young man were also among those who were killed in these strikes. Most of them [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=347.76000000000005s)]
*  were civilians. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjV7HT5rZMw&t=355.04s)]
