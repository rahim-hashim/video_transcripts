# What was agreed in the UK-US trade deal? #DonaldTrump #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA)
*  That door there is the entrance that goes through to the Oval Office at the back there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=0.0s)]
*  And I've just come from that very room where President Trump announced this US-UK tariffs deal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=5.0s)]
*  Now what does it mean? Basically, what the Americans have done here is remove some of the tariffs [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=13.0s)]
*  that President Trump had put on just a few weeks ago. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=19.0s)]
*  It means that Britain can now sell steel and aluminium to the US without a 25% tariff, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=22.0s)]
*  an import tax that he put on earlier on this year. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=28.0s)]
*  And on cars, a 27.5% tariff now reduced down to 10%. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=32.0s)]
*  But that still means that Britain is basically in a worse position than it was before the Trump presidency. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=38.0s)]
*  Now another big issue here is around American beef and chicken. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=45.0s)]
*  At the moment, Britain doesn't buy that stuff because there is hormones often implanted in cattle [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=50.0s)]
*  in the US, chicken is chlorinated, and the Americans are saying they're going to open up access [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=56.0s)]
*  for their farmers to the UK market. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=61.0s)]
*  The British are saying they're not going to lower their food standards. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=64.0s)]
*  What that means is they've touted that part of the deal, but there isn't actually any agreement on that yet. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=67.0s)]
*  Both sides though, touting this is a historic deal, a breakthrough, as President Trump put it, for the UK. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaOcHVtQbRA&t=73.0s)]
