Video Description: Afrikaner Charl Kleinhaus is among the group of nearly 60 white South Africans who have moved to the US under President Donald Trumpâ€™s controversial policy to grant refugee status to Afrikaners.
 
The 46-year-old left his family farm in Mpumalanga province, South Africa, for a new life in the US - saying he quit his homeland after receiving death threats in WhatsApp messages.
 
The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics, who claim there has been a "genocide" of white farmers in the country.
 
None of South Africa's political parties - including those that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general - have claimed that there is a genocide in South Africa.

# White South African defends refugee status in US | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0)
*  This week, a group of 59 white South Africans arrived in the US, where they've been granted refugee status. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump says the refugee applications were expedited because the people concerned were victims of racial discrimination, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=7.0s)]
*  something South Africa's government denies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=15.0s)]
*  The Afrikaners are descended from Dutch settlers who arrived four centuries ago to South Africa [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=17.0s)]
*  and who led the government which brought in apartheid, a racially segregated political system [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=22.0s)]
*  which has led to discrimination against black South Africans and it's no longer in force. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=27.0s)]
*  Well usually it takes years for the US government to process refugee applications, but this group waited only three months. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=32.0s)]
*  Well our North America correspondent, Nomiye Iqbal, has been speaking to one of those who made the journey. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=40.0s)]
*  If you're white, you're wrong in South Africa. You're a land thief, you are a racist, the whole time it's been told, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=45.0s)]
*  and there is a racist white people, plenty of them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=53.0s)]
*  You say you're not a racist white person? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=56.0s)]
*  No, not at all. I've got many black friends. I think I've got more African black men as white friends. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=59.0s)]
*  I'm tired of being told just because I'm white I'm a thief, just because I'm white I'm wrong in this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=67.0s)]
*  I had nothing to do with apartheid. Nothing, nothing, nothing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=73.0s)]
*  Is there anything specific that's happened, Charles, that made you think I've got to get out of here? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=76.0s)]
*  After the death threats and stuff and my machinery being cut up and I'm still, after reporting everything to the police, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=81.0s)]
*  not getting any protection or anything like that, the only thing that's left on my farm is a sign that says mining area. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=87.0s)]
*  All the fences have been taken off, boom gates have been broken off. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=96.0s)]
*  There are voices out there, including the South African president who has called you cowards. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=99.0s)]
*  You've got other Afrikaners who are saying that you're not refugees, you're opportunists, that you've abandoned the country. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=105.0s)]
*  What would you say to those people? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=114.0s)]
*  I had to leave a five bedroom house, which I will lose now because I'm not going to pay for it, behind my car, behind my dogs, behind my mother, behind... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=116.0s)]
*  It is not... I didn't come here for fun, but my children are safe. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=128.0s)]
*  What was it like when you got off the shuttle bus and came into that hangar and were greeted by the Trump administration? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=134.0s)]
*  It was overwhelming. I didn't expect that because I thought we were going to be in a shuttle bus taken somewhere and we were going to start working. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=140.0s)]
*  All of us that is there, we know we're going to start here from the bottom because we are the new people here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=150.0s)]
*  We're going to start from the bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=156.0s)]
*  Do you ever worry that you might be caught up in some big political game here? That you're a pawn somehow? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=159.0s)]
*  It's a scary, scary thing, but people mustn't think we're just taking advantage of this. We're coming here to make a contribution to the country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=166.0s)]
*  Old tweets of yours have been dug up in which you appear to have made anti-Semitic comments and so people are questioning, should you be here? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=174.0s)]
*  What would you say to that? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=183.0s)]
*  I would like them... [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=184.0s)]
*  What was that to clarify? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=185.0s)]
*  I've deleted a comment, but I was actually thinking I should have not deleted it. If you go look where I commented on, it was passed over to Orthodox Jews and I'm Christian. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=186.0s)]
*  We're spitting and screaming and bumping Christians walking with the cross. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=197.0s)]
*  For me as a Christian that is not acceptable. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=202.0s)]
*  In Israel, and I went and I said something on Twitter which I copy and pasted from somebody else's page because if you go read my post you'll see it's not the way I write. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=205.0s)]
*  So you had quoted someone else? I mean the quotes... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=216.0s)]
*  I copied and pasted it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=218.0s)]
*  The quotes were anti-Semitic. They said Jews are dangerous people, they're untrustworthy, they're not God-chosen people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=220.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I was super angry. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=227.0s)]
*  So you did it out of anger? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=228.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I was in hospital at that point of time. I was on morphine, but that's not an excuse. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=229.0s)]
*  Do you want to make an anti-Semite though, do you? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=236.0s)]
*  Even now, if I would see any person going against my religion, I will speak up against it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=238.0s)]
*  You have high hopes being here in America. Is there a part of you that is anxious that it might not work out? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=246.0s)]
*  No, to be honest with you, because of my belief, I believe this is God's plan for me. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJT7hM4GxC0&t=253.0s)]
