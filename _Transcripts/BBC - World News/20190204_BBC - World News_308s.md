# Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 04, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w)
*  Baseball is the national sport. Those huge comfy gas guzzling cars are mainstream. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=0.0s)]
*  Where does everyone hang out? The mall. But this is in America. This is Venezuela. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=9.0s)]
*  The U.S. and Venezuela share a history that goes back centuries. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=17.0s)]
*  A Pew Research poll in 2014 found that 62% of Venezuelans had a favorable opinion of the U.S. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=22.0s)]
*  But their leaders haven't always seemed eye to eye. So how did it go from this... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=29.0s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy is the first U.S. president to visit Venezuela. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=35.0s)]
*  To this... [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=38.0s)]
*  We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=39.0s)]
*  To understand the relationship between Venezuela and the U.S. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=44.0s)]
*  You have to know that it mainly revolves around one precious resource. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=47.0s)]
*  Oil. The first oil wells were drilled in the early 20th century. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=52.0s)]
*  By 1940, Venezuela became the third largest producer of crude oil in the world. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=57.0s)]
*  From the beginning, American companies were heavily involved. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=63.0s)]
*  And the U.S. also bought the majority of the country's oil. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=68.0s)]
*  And in 1961, John F. Kennedy made the first official visit of a U.S. president to Venezuela. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=73.0s)]
*  Liberty and economic progress go hand in hand. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=79.0s)]
*  Here's Jackie Kennedy, delighting the crowd with a few words of Spanish. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=83.0s)]
*  A few words of Spanish. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=87.0s)]
*  The Cold War, oil and trade set the tone for decades of friendship. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=91.0s)]
*  During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Venezuela backed the U.S. against its Caribbean neighbor. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=96.0s)]
*  And in the 60s and 70s, the country experienced an oil bonanza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=101.0s)]
*  Thousands of U.S. oil workers and businessmen took their families to live in Venezuela and work in their oil fields. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=107.0s)]
*  With them, they brought American culture, food, fashion. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=116.0s)]
*  Venezuela's lapped up all things American. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=120.0s)]
*  And the country became one of the most dependable markets for U.S. consumer goods. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=124.0s)]
*  But not everyone was such a fan of the U.S. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=132.0s)]
*  During this whole time, there was always a large part of the population that was against the influence of the superpower. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=135.0s)]
*  And despite the huge oil boom, large sections of society remained poor. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=143.0s)]
*  All the while, the pro-U.S. political elite in the country grew richer. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=148.0s)]
*  This anger spilled out into the streets and built up until 1998, when Hugo Chavez was elected president in a landslide victory. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=154.0s)]
*  In the beginning, Chavez wasn't that anti-American firebrand he later became. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=164.0s)]
*  Washington cautiously welcomed the new leader and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=169.0s)]
*  That all changed in 2002, when a military coup overthrew Chavez for 48 hours. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=176.0s)]
*  He was convinced that the U.S. was behind the plot. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=184.0s)]
*  Today, though, we know that American officials knew about the coup beforehand and had contact with some of its leaders. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=187.0s)]
*  This was enough to change Chavez and Venezuela's relationship with the U.S. from then on. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=193.0s)]
*  This was Chavez talking the day after President George Bush Jr. at the UN. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=199.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the devil came here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=204.0s)]
*  In this same place, it still smells sulfur. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=211.0s)]
*  He kept up the rhetoric with President Obama too. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=215.0s)]
*  It was a fraud, Obama. It was a fraud. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=218.0s)]
*  But despite the war of words and Chavez's friendliness with some of America's biggest enemies, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=222.0s)]
*  the oil and trade between the two countries kept flowing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=228.0s)]
*  Until now. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=233.0s)]
*  After Chavez died in 2013, successor and so-called son, Nicolas Maduro, took over. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=234.0s)]
*  The U.S. saw him as an autocrat who let Venezuelans starve and oversaw hyperinflation, record murder rates and political isolation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=241.0s)]
*  The U.S. began imposing sanctions on Mr. Maduro and his government. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=250.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has even used Venezuela's socialist model as a way to attack his opponents. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=254.0s)]
*  The Democrats want to turn America into Venezuela. That'll be wonderful. That'll be wonderful. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=259.0s)]
*  Things came to a head in 2019 when the U.S. recognized Juan Guaid√≥, the head of the National Assembly, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=265.0s)]
*  as the new president of Venezuela after allegations of electoral fraud. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=272.0s)]
*  In response, Maduro broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and vowed to hang on to power. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=277.0s)]
*  It's clear that the relations between Venezuela and the U.S. have reached a new low. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=284.0s)]
*  But can both countries really get by without the other? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=289.0s)]
*  With America still the dominant superpower in the region and Venezuela having the largest proven oil reserves in the world, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=293.0s)]
*  this doesn't seem to be the end of the story. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGmRJNee-w&t=300.0s)]
