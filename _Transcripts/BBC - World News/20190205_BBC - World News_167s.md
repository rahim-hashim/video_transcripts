# Has Trump kept his promises? - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA)
*  The state of our union is strong because our people are strong. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=0.0s)]
*  But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=17.0s)]
*  Fast forward to December 2018 when President Trump tweeted that the US would be pulling troops out of Syria, saying that ISIS had been defeated. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=24.0s)]
*  And we have won against ISIS. We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We've taken back the land. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=33.0s)]
*  Many experts and officials dispute that statement while ISIS has lost much of the territory it held in the Middle East. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=40.0s)]
*  It still has a large presence in Syria and Iraq with an estimated 30,000 fighters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=46.0s)]
*  And at the start of this year ISIS claimed responsibility for a deadly explosion in the Syrian city of Manbij. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=52.0s)]
*  I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=61.0s)]
*  So what fundamental flaws is he talking about? Well, the deal is narrowly focused on Iran's nuclear programme and doesn't include other possible threats. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=69.0s)]
*  I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=78.0s)]
*  Yes, he kept his promise and he's made it part of a broader policy to counter what he calls Iran's malign and terrorist activity. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=86.0s)]
*  But pulling out of the deal has also damaged US credibility because in fact Iran was and still is sticking to its terms. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=94.0s)]
*  It has strained relations with America's European allies because they helped negotiate the accord and are sticking with it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=101.0s)]
*  And critics argue ditching a carefully crafted arms control agreement makes the Middle East less stable, not more. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=107.0s)]
*  Tonight I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=114.0s)]
*  Infrastructure investment wasn't a new idea for Donald Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=128.0s)]
*  He talked about it relentlessly on the 2016 campaign trail and promised new bridges and roads and tunnels and airports in his inaugural address. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=132.0s)]
*  The $1.5 trillion price tag in his State of the Union, however, was new, but since then he's done almost nothing to make it a reality. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=140.0s)]
*  We're going to rebuild America's grumbling infrastructure. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=149.0s)]
*  Congressional legislation has been non-existent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=155.0s)]
*  And while infrastructure investment is something that traditionally both parties can agree on, there seems to be very little interest in bipartisan cooperation right now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeK25DujRUA&t=158.0s)]
