Video Description: More than a thousand LGBTQ couples across Thailand will marry today as same-sex unions become legal in the country.
 
The law kicked into effect on Thursday after a sustained campaign that one activist described as a "long fight full of tears‚Äù.
 
LGBTQ couples now have the same rights as other couples to manage assets, inherit, adopt and take decisions about their partner's medical treatment.
 
But activists say they are fighting for more changes because many laws are still not gender-neutral.

*  A same-sex marriage becomes illegal in the country, the first in Southeast Asia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  LGBTQ couples now have the same rights as other couples to manage assets, inherit, adopt [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=10.4s)]

*  Jonathan Head is at the Siam Paragon luxury mall in central Bangkok where the mass weddings [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=19.92s)]
*  are being held. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=24.32s)]
*  He joins us live for more on this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=25.32s)]
*  Jonathan, tell us more about the significance of today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=28.16s)]
*  It is very significant to the LGBTQ community here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Everybody who's come to Thailand knows that LGBTQ people tend to be quite visible, you [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=36.56s)]
*  see a lot of trans people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=42.0s)]
*  It has a reputation as being a country that's very tolerant, an easy place to be open. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=43.58s)]
*  But they haven't had legal rights and that's a big deal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  Today for the first time, I think for many of them, there's this acknowledgement that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=53.24s)]
*  they are the same as everyone else, they've got the same rights. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=56.44s)]
*  It's not complete yet, there's still a few areas that still need to be improved. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  But being able to marry really is, you know, for some of these couples have been together [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  a very, very long time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=66.32s)]
*  I've actually got a couple with me now, Gay and Ploy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=67.8s)]
*  They've been together for 17 years. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=71.96s)]
*  Congratulations to both of you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=73.88s)]
*  Tell me about, first of all, how do you feel today? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm really excited because we come here in the first couple to lead the license marriage. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=79.76s)]
*  You're the first? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=86.84s)]
*  Yes, in here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=87.84s)]
*  Number one? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=88.84s)]
*  Number one in here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=89.84s)]
*  Very surprised because we wake up in the early morning and come together and the first one [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=90.84s)]
*  is us. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  Tell me why this is so important because you could be open about being same-sex LGBTQ before, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  actually legal marriage. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  Why is that such a big step for you? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  Because for the healthy and the techs in Thailand, if we get married, we have to get off the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=112.72s)]
*  techs and healthy for her, I have to sign the healthy and for the surgery or everything [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  for her. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=126.8s)]
*  You can make big decisions for her. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=127.8s)]
*  Yes, and for the property I give her for the marriage is okay in Thailand. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=128.8s)]
*  I signed the marriage license here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=134.56s)]
*  So you can have a home together. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=136.88s)]
*  Any plans for children? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=139.48s)]
*  I think in five or ten years we need to hope to have some children as well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=142.12s)]
*  In the future, I think. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=149.68s)]
*  What about your families? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=151.36s)]
*  What do they think about this? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=155.6s)]
*  Our family is very happy for us because we met her in 17 years and we have a whole family [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=157.6s)]
*  now and we are very happy today we got married like a married person. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=166.0s)]
*  So today do you feel like you have the same rights as everybody else in Thailand? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=173.2s)]
*  We have the same person in Thailand. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=179.2s)]
*  Well, congratulations to both of you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=183.6s)]
*  You have a handsome gay employee, just one of around 200 couples who have come down here [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=187.52s)]
*  today. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  You can hear the music behind me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  It has been a very celebratory atmosphere. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  But it has been a long, hard campaign. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Although this is a very lighthearted affair, for the campaigners, ten years ago they were [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  not at all sure that they could get this law through. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=205.56s)]
*  There was a lot of resistance. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=208.4s)]
*  Public attitudes have really shifted in Thailand. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=210.12s)]
*  For all of its famous openness, there was a lot of resistance to actually changing the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=213.0s)]
*  law. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=216.72s)]
*  And today there are no gender specific terms relating to marriage. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=217.72s)]
*  And that makes such a big difference to everybody here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=221.6s)]
*  The rest of the region, of course, very different. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=224.32s)]
*  The neighboring countries, accommodated by the religion or traditional, just the lack [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=226.6s)]
*  of political freedom, all of those make it much more difficult. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=230.76s)]
*  So Thailand is still very much an outlier in South East Asia. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=233.8s)]
*  Back to you, Stephen. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJAE3JvmtU&t=238.04s)]
