Video Description: UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House on Thurday.
 
Following the meeting, Trump said “a real trade deal” between the US and UK could happen "very quickly”, which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the US has been threatening on some of its trading partners.
 
Later today, Trump is due to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington, where the pair will hash out and potentially sign a much-discussed minerals deal.
 
It comes after yesterday's news conference, where Trump was asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if he stuck by his claim that Zelensky is a "dictator", to which the he replied: “Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question”.

# Zelensky arrives in Washington, after 'successful' UK-US talks | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q)
*  Sakhir Starmer and President Trump have both held their talks at the White House as a major success, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=0.0s)]
*  saying they've made progress towards ending the war in Ukraine and agreeing a trade deal between [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=5.76s)]
*  Britain and the United States. The British Prime Minister said it was a moment of tremendous [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=10.8s)]
*  opportunity and called for a peace deal that would not reward the aggressor. President Trump also [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=16.56s)]
*  said he would consider providing the security backstop in Ukraine that Sakhir Starmer had been [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=23.28s)]
*  calling for. The US President praised Ukraine's President Zelensky after earlier describing him [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=28.56s)]
*  as a dictator. Mr Zelensky will visit the White House later on Friday, where the two leaders [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=34.56s)]
*  expected to sign a major minerals deal. Our political editor Chris Mason was at the White [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=40.08s)]
*  House. He sent this report. It is perhaps the ultimate political stage and backdrop and is [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  now home to a president whose love and command of that stage is reshaping the world before our [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  eyes. The Prime Minister arrived here at the White House for one of the landmark moments of his time [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=58.24s)]
*  in office so far and for a president who likes a theatrical flourish, the Prime Minister had one [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=64.0s)]
*  in his inside pocket. So can I present the letter from the King? Thank you very much. Am I supposed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=70.48s)]
*  to read it right now? Yeah please do. So this is a letter from His Majesty the King. It's an invitation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=77.76s)]
*  for a second state visit. This is really special. This has never happened before. What I haven't [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=87.44s)]
*  got yet is your answer. The answer is yes. Ukraine is a key talking point here and there's a key [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=93.52s)]
*  question at the heart of it. Mr President, could you be persuaded as part of a peace settlement in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=103.84s)]
*  Ukraine to provide air cover, a backstop security position, to the contributions that Europe might [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=109.36s)]
*  make as well? Well so President Zelensky is coming to see me on Friday, Friday morning, and we're [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=114.8s)]
*  going to be signing really a very important agreement for both sides because it's really [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  going to get us into that country. We'll be working there. We'll have a lot of people working there [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=126.32s)]
*  and so in that sense it's very good. It's a backstop you could say. I don't think anybody's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=131.68s)]
*  going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers. And what of the president's description [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=136.0s)]
*  of Ukraine's leader? Mr President, do you still think that Mr Zelensky is a dictator? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=141.52s)]
*  Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question. Next we were kicked out. They went into [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=149.28s)]
*  their private discussions and emerged a few hours later for a news conference where the president [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  said the prime minister was a tough negotiator. The war in Ukraine will end fairly soon or not at [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=160.8s)]
*  all and he was asked had Kyrstama persuaded him not to put tariffs on the UK. I think we could [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=166.4s)]
*  very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see but he's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=174.0s)]
*  he earned whatever they whatever they pay him here and today. He was working hard at lunch [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=183.52s)]
*  and and I'm very receptive to it. I think we in all fairness, in all seriousness, I think we have [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=188.24s)]
*  a very good chance at arriving at a very good deal. Our trading relationship is not just strong, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=193.92s)]
*  it's fair, balanced and reciprocal. We're leaders together in so many areas. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=199.92s)]
*  The US-UK relationship has always been close but there are no guarantees with the new resident here [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=206.88s)]
*  but for now at least the prime minister's escaped the barbs and frost others have encountered. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=213.92s)]
*  Chris Mason, BBC News in Washington. And as we heard there, Donald Trump appears to have softened [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  his attitude towards Ukraine's President Zelensky. He praised him after earlier referring to him as [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  a dictator and he said the two men would soon be signing a deal regarding Ukraine's mineral wealth. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=233.04s)]
*  But what's the mood in Kiev? This is the BBC's James Waterhouse. I think they are less hopeful, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=238.64s)]
*  less certain than Donald Trump was sounding yesterday. He seems to be [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  thinking or outwardly saying that he expects President Zelensky to sign this deal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  From this side, this is a deal that would see America get access to billions of dollars worth [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  of Ukraine's natural resources and oil and gas. But in exchange for what is the question being [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=260.88s)]
*  increasingly asked? It doesn't contain security guarantees yet such as military presence, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  air defence systems to help Ukraine sustain a ceasefire after this war ends and to stop Russia [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=274.4s)]
*  from invading again. And so at the moment, I'm speaking to one opposition MP, there is a concern [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  that whilst he is going to have a face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump, that is not to be [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=287.2s)]
*  dismissed. The outcome is harder to grasp and there are calls here for Mr Zelensky to involve [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=292.56s)]
*  Ukrainian Parliament more in this decision and to try and provide some kind of guarantee [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=300.96s)]
*  that Ukraine will get what it needs. I mean, we did see a slight warming of language, you're right, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=307.76s)]
*  from Mr Trump where he said they both have great respect for each other. That is a climb down from [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=313.2s)]
*  calling him a dictator. But whether that equates to an agreement which would [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=318.4s)]
*  see an exchange of like with like for Ukraine, I think that is quite another question. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=325.76s)]
*  Let's speak to Peter Dickinson, editor of Ukraine Alert at the Atlantic Council Think Tank. Thank [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=330.56s)]
*  you for joining us on BBC News. So it appears that President Zelensky will receive a much warmer [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=336.16s)]
*  welcome from Donald Trump than many had expected. So what do you think he can realistically expect [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  to achieve from his visit to Washington? Well, I think one of the key issues here is that it [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  will buy Ukraine some time. The comments coming from President Trump and from the White House and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=355.12s)]
*  his administration have been deeply disturbing for Ukrainians this last few weeks. This very [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=361.44s)]
*  sharp turn toward Russia, the aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine has really raised fears that the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=367.68s)]
*  American support for Ukraine is under threat long term. We may face a scenario where Ukraine was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  being pushed into a very pro-Kremlin peace agreement which would place Ukraine's entire [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=381.2s)]
*  existence as a nation under threat. Now this deal, this resources, this minerals deal will [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=386.56s)]
*  potentially buy Ukraine that time it needs. It doesn't bring security guarantees. It doesn't [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=393.2s)]
*  even guarantee military aid, but it does allow Donald Trump to declare victory. The deal maker [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=398.4s)]
*  can parade his deal and say, look, we're not just giving Ukraine aid for nothing. We're getting [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=404.08s)]
*  something in return. And Zelensky is able to ingratiate himself with the American president, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=408.72s)]
*  and I'm sure he will press him for in the short term more military aid and then more long term [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  the security guarantees that Ukraine so desperately needs. And how open do you think [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is towards providing more military aid to Ukraine as it waits for a peace agreement [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  to be reached with Russia? Well, his most recent comments suggest that he is open to it. He said [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=433.52s)]
*  that he will look at that and he will be prepared to provide aid until a peace deal or a ceasefire, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  at least, can be signed. So I think that this deal, now the actual details of this [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  minerals agreement are in some respects quite vague, but it does allow Trump to be able to say [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=452.0s)]
*  that he's protecting American interests and he's making sure that America is not simply financing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=458.88s)]
*  the Ukrainian war effort and getting nothing in return. So it does open the door for Trump to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=466.4s)]
*  save face in front of his own electorate and continue the aid. So that's certainly what we'd [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=471.2s)]
*  be looking for today. I think there's unlikely to be any agreements on a long term security [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=475.76s)]
*  guarantee, but Ukraine will be hoping that they hear at least encouraging words and perhaps even [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=480.24s)]
*  confirmation that military aid in the short term will continue. And those talks towards ending the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=485.52s)]
*  war in Ukraine between the United States and Russia, could we see Ukrainian officials being [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=491.68s)]
*  invited to those talks? Well, at this stage, it does look very much like Trump's vision is for a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=496.64s)]
*  bilateral negotiation. That's certainly his style. He likes the idea of the big boys, the superpowers [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=503.44s)]
*  sitting down and talking to each other head to head. He's very keen, I'm sure, on having a [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=510.64s)]
*  summit with Vladimir Putin. Ukraine is very much a third wheel here, somehow being left to the side, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=515.68s)]
*  but they will be involved in discussions. They will be certainly consulted. And [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  President Zelensky will make his case today that they need to be very much involved in that in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=528.64s)]
*  parallel, if not directly. It's unlikely that Ukraine and Russia will speak directly, very [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  unlikely, in fact. But Ukraine will certainly push their positions. Zelensky will today [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=537.6s)]
*  emphasise that it's absolutely crucial that a parallel track of discussion is ongoing between [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  the Trump White House and Ukraine. Peter Dickinson, thank you very much. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=550.08s)]
*  Thank you. And of course, we'll have live coverage from Washington, D.C. later on on Friday, of course, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  as those meetings between President Trump and President Zelensky get underway there. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4g0tHE70Q&t=561.9200000000001s)]
