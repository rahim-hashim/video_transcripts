Video Description: The search for missing footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson has been called off after rescuers failed to find their plane.
Cardiff City's Argentine striker, 28, and Mr Ibbotson were on the aircraft that disappeared from radar on Monday.
After three days, authorities made the decision to abandon the search.
Guernsey Police tweeted at 15:15 GMT to say rescuers were "no longer actively searching" for the plane.
The statement, from harbourmaster Capt David Barker said the chances of survival "are extremely remote".
He added: "Despite best efforts of air and search assets from the Channel Islands, UK and France...we have been unable to find any trace of the aircraft the pilot or the passenger.

# Emiliano Sala: Search for footballer and pilot called off - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 24, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4)
*  We've taken the decision to terminate our search and that decision has been difficult [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=0.0s)]
*  as you can imagine, not least because there are a huge number of people both here in the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=8.16s)]
*  UK and in France who've been involved in this search over the last three days, all of whom, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=14.72s)]
*  including myself, had hoped for a positive outcome. But that's not been the case. But [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=20.92s)]
*  importantly because I'm well aware that this will be very unwelcome news for the family [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=26.0s)]
*  and friends of the two occupants of the missing aircraft. I would like at this stage to pay [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=33.92s)]
*  thanks to all of those people who've been involved in what has been an incredible cooperative [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=41.68s)]
*  operation. That includes our own coastguard personnel here in the Joint Control Centre [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=49.080000000000005s)]
*  and in Guernsey and in Jersey, as well as the coastguard organisations in the UK, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=56.92s)]
*  at the National Maritime Operations Centre and at Dover Coastguard. It also includes [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=63.56s)]
*  personnel from the volunteer services, from the RNLI who man both the Guernsey and Alderney life [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=71.64s)]
*  boats, the volunteers who support and operate the search aircraft which operates Channel [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=78.68s)]
*  Island Air Search out of Guernsey, the members of the Guernsey and UK Police Force [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=88.68s)]
*  and the French authorities, Crossmart in Joburg, who are the search and rescue authority for the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=95.72s)]
*  northern bit of France. We've also had participation from French Navy aircraft and from the civilian [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=105.72s)]
*  owned helicopter based in Brecoup and last but not least, the members of the public who responded [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=113.72s)]
*  to our request to report any objects or incidents which might be linked to this missing aircraft. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=122.28s)]
*  First and foremost, our thoughts are with the family and friends of David Ibbotson [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=134.2s)]
*  and Emiliano Sala for whom this must be a very difficult time. I can't begin to imagine [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=141.32s)]
*  how they must be feeling but I do understand and I hope they will find some comfort from the fact [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=151.72s)]
*  that we are not closing this incident. Although we are stopping searching, the incident remains open [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=158.68s)]
*  and we are continuing with our broadcasts to ships and aircraft which are passing through the area [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=165.56s)]
*  and asking them to report anything which may be linked to the missing aircraft. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=172.04s)]
*  I have time for a few questions and I'd be happy to take those now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=176.28s)]
*  With the noise you have of these waters, are you surprised that you've found absolutely nothing so far? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=181.48s)]
*  No, I'm not. The waters concerned are at flood tide at the moment and spring tide. There are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=187.48s)]
*  there are up to 12 knots of currents running through these waters and so our search area [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=199.64s)]
*  by the hour has been getting larger and larger. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=206.28s)]
*  What do you feel might have happened to that plane? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=213.64s)]
*  We can't really speculate on that at the moment. It will be subject to an investigation by the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=216.76s)]
*  Air Accident Investigation Branch from the UK and all the air traffic control records [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  being gathered and will be sent to them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  Have you spoken directly to the family of Salah? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=230.6s)]
*  I have spoken to the family of Mr Ibbotson. I haven't had a chance to speak to the family [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=233.48s)]
*  of Emeliana Salah but I've offered to speak with them if that's what they want. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=238.68s)]
*  Captain, speaking to the family, were they accepting of your decision or [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=246.28s)]
*  their preference? I haven't spoken since we took the decision to stop the search. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=250.76s)]
*  That has been done by families liaison officers from the police forces in Cardiff and Humbasside. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=256.76s)]
*  I understand that Emeliana Salah's family are not content with the decision to stop the search [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  and I fully understand that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=272.84s)]
*  Do you feel you've done as much as you possibly can? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=274.52s)]
*  Absolutely. We've reviewed it very carefully following the same protocol that the UK Coast [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  Guard would follow when taking such decisions. I'm absolutely confident that we could not have [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=282.2s)]
*  done any more. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=287.64s)]
*  You mentioned the investigation. What else can you tell us about what happens next? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  As I say, the records will all be passed to the Air Accident Investigation Branch [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=294.44s)]
*  and they will determine what the next steps are for them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=299.08s)]
*  At the same time, it remains a missing persons case as far as Guernsey Police are concerned. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=303.8s)]
*  We've heard the plane try to take off three times in France before taking off on the fourth time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  Can you help us on that? Is that correct? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=319.56s)]
*  I haven't investigated what happened to the plane before it lost contact. My focus has been entirely [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=323.8s)]
*  on saving lives at sea and trying to find the two men and recover them whilst they were still alive. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=329.32s)]
*  The fact that Mr Salah was able to send a message using data would suggest that he was within a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=335.32s)]
*  cell tower area. Have you been able to look at those records to see whether that also ties in [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=341.56s)]
*  with the information you have from Air Traffic Control? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=346.92s)]
*  We have engaged with the telephone companies and we understand that there were a number of data [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=349.24s)]
*  exchanges up until the aircraft was last in contact. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=355.64s)]
*  Did they plot in the same areas? Has that helped you with your search? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=360.28s)]
*  We haven't been able to get any positional information from those intercepts at all. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=363.24s)]
*  So there's no triangulation of those points? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=367.24s)]
*  Are you still looking at missing persons investigation? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=369.24s)]
*  Are these individuals missing? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=373.88s)]
*  They have to be until they are found. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=378.76s)]
*  We heard also the plane may have been turning back to France. Can you help us on that? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=383.08s)]
*  No, again the records from the Air Traffic Control authorities in Jersey who were dealing [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=388.6s)]
*  with the plane will be analysed by the Air Accident Investigation Branch and they'll be able to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=394.76s)]
*  determine what it was doing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  You mentioned a protocol. Is there a usual amount of time by which you would usually call up a search? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=404.03999999999996s)]
*  No, it's very dependent on the circumstances in the individual case and no two are the same. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=409.56s)]
*  I know that you said you're not aware of what happened to the plane but from the recordings [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=414.52s)]
*  you now know what's happening. Is there anything that you can determine from that? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=424.91999999999996s)]
*  Any engine noise or anything that might be indicated? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=429.0s)]
*  It's possible. I know that the Air Accident Investigation Branch are capable of forensically [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=431.0s)]
*  examining the recordings. They will also be looking very carefully at the recordings from [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=436.76s)]
*  weather radar and from the primary and secondary air traffic control radars. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=442.52s)]
*  We know that there was a line of heavy weather in close proximity to where the aircraft was [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  in contact so that is a possibility but it's very difficult to determine. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  That's very close to the last known position of the aircraft. Herd deep is over 100 metres in depth [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=481.0s)]
*  and so finding anything in that depth of water is going to be extremely difficult. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=487.64s)]
*  But we can't say conclusively that that's where, if the plane is on the seabed, that's where it is. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=493.47999999999996s)]
*  If there are no other questions I'll carry on. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  That's Captain David Marker who's harbour master on Guernsey confirming that news in the last few [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=508.52s)]
*  moments that rescue workers have called off their search for the missing plane carrying the footballer [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=513.96s)]
*  Emiliano Sala and also the pilot David Ebertson. The chances that they had survived [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=518.52s)]
*  were extremely remote said Captain Barker. This aircraft has been missing since it disappeared [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=526.76s)]
*  from radar over the English Channel on Monday night. After scanning thousands of square miles [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=532.28s)]
*  and reviewing all the information available he said the difficult decision to end the search [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=536.84s)]
*  had been taken. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8fL7gyU_m4&t=541.64s)]
