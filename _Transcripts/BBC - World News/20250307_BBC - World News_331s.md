*  Now, to Ukraine. The country says that its energy and gas infrastructure has again come [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=0.0s)]
*  under widespread air attack from Russia involving at least 67 missiles and 194 drones. Yet the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=5.2s)]
*  energy minister said that Russia was trying to harm the civilian population by targeting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=12.76s)]
*  energy production. Officials in Odessa and Kharkiv say that waves of attacks left infrastructure [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=17.3s)]
*  damaged and homes on fire. Several injuries have been reported in Kharkiv and elsewhere [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=23.12s)]
*  the military administration in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk say that Russian [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=28.64s)]
*  glide bombs injured seven people, including two children. Kyiv says that for the first [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  time Ukraine has used French Mirage jets to repel a Russian attack. While these latest [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=39.92s)]
*  attacks come as Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky says that he will travel to Saudi [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=45.88s)]
*  Arabia next week where Ukrainian and US officials are due to discuss an initial ceasefire with [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=50.36s)]
*  Russia. Mr Zelensky, who won't attend those discussions, said that Kyiv was working constructively [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=56.68s)]
*  for a fast and lasting peace. But this news comes as European leaders held emergency talks [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=62.64s)]
*  in Brussels on boosting defence spending and support for Kyiv. President Zelensky says [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  he's thankful his country is not alone after President Trump cut military aid and intelligence [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=73.2s)]
*  sharing with Ukraine. The Kremlin's warned again against European peacekeepers being [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=79.56s)]
*  deployed in Ukraine. Well, at the summit in Brussels, the EU leaders agreed unanimously [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=85.12s)]
*  that both Russia and its ally Belarus posed a threat. The European Commission president [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen said that they were determined to act with, as she put it, the scale, speed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  and resolve that the situation needed. And she had this message for Mr Trump. We all [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  want a peace through strength, a just and lasting peace, but a peace from a position [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=107.12s)]
*  of strength. And this is also in the interest of President Trump, to have a peace through [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  strength. And if he wants to achieve this, it is only possible with the support of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=119.12s)]
*  European Union and its member states because preconditions have to be met. We have been [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  the ones, for example, who have secured the economic survival of Ukraine for the year [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=131.44s)]
*  We are the ones who now invest a lot in Ukrainian defence industry and are providing the military [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=137.96s)]
*  capabilities that Ukraine needs. Ursula von der Leyen, at the close of yesterday's summit, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=147.08s)]
*  well our Europe editor Katja Adler has this analysis from Brussels. We keep hearing that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=153.08s)]
*  Europe is in a historic and unprecedented moment and at their emergency summit today, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  the EU leaders have come up with something quite exceptional, means of producing unprecedented [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=165.28s)]
*  amounts of funds for defence spending. And that includes Germany, which is normally so [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=171.08s)]
*  debt shy, pushing for the bloc to take on more debt. And all of this with the view of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=177.52s)]
*  Europe becoming less reliant on the United States for its defence, which it has been [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=183.84s)]
*  since the Second World War. What has not been the aim of this meeting, though, is for leaders [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=189.0s)]
*  to thumb their nose at Washington and say, we don't need you any more, neither in Ukraine [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=193.64s)]
*  nor more widely in Europe. In fact, what they have been hoping is that by showing that they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=198.64s)]
*  will take more responsibility for their own defence, they can persuade Donald Trump to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=202.55999999999997s)]
*  keep the capabilities in place in Europe that they so really need. Katja Adler there, well [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=207.04s)]
*  those meetings in Europe are being followed closely in Washington. Our North America correspondent [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  Merlyn Thomas gave us her thoughts on where the transatlantic relationship and in particular [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=218.84s)]
*  the US relationship with Ukraine now stands. This is the first high level meeting that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=224.12s)]
*  we know of between the two countries since that very public shouting match that took [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=230.24s)]
*  place in the Oval Office between President Trump and President Zelensky. Now, President [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=235.16s)]
*  Trump's senior aide and envoy, Steve Wyckoff, has confirmed that this meeting will take [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=240.6s)]
*  place in Saudi Arabia next week and President Zelensky has separately confirmed it and has [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=245.28s)]
*  said that he will be meeting with the Crown Prince as well on Monday. Now, Mr. Wyckoff [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=250.0s)]
*  says that this meeting is primarily to work on a framework for peace and he said that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=255.88s)]
*  President Zelensky had acknowledged how much the US had done for Ukraine and had also apologised. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=260.6s)]
*  And so this is a really significant moment but also it should be taken day by day because [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=267.84s)]
*  it was just last week that President Trump had said he wanted a deal with Ukraine and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=272.12s)]
*  then since then we've seen the US withdraw military support from Ukraine and also stop [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=276.4s)]
*  intelligence sharing with Ukraine and many have said that those moves are really a way [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=282.4s)]
*  for the US to bring Ukraine to the negotiating table and possibly get it to make some concessions [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=287.72s)]
*  when brokering that peace deal. Now, President Zelensky has made it clear that his Ukrainian [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=294.8s)]
*  delegation will be in Saudi Arabia to work on peace and he said that Ukrainians truly [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  do want peace but not at the cost of giving up Ukraine. Now, remember it was just last [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=305.36s)]
*  month that it was Russian officials who are meeting with American officials in Saudi Arabia [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=311.16s)]
*  and it was Ukraine that was feeling sidelined. Now, it's Ukraine that's meeting with American [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=315.36s)]
*  officials in Saudi Arabia and this may be that lifeline that Ukraine is really looking [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=321.76s)]
*  for in order to find that way to peace and end this war. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwkMAIO_WWE&t=326.96s)]
