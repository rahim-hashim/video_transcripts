# Pakistan vows to respond to India missile strikes | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8)
*  Hello, welcome to the programme. I'm Lewis Vaughan Jones. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=0.0s)]
*  Pakistan has accused India of igniting an inferno in the region [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=3.52s)]
*  by killing at least 26 people in a series of missile strikes and gunfire. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=7.88s)]
*  Several sites in Pakistan and Pakistan administered Kashmir were hit, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  including this mosque. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=17.64s)]
*  The National Security Council says India's actions caused grave danger [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=19.32s)]
*  to commercial airlines, endangering thousands of lives, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=23.72s)]
*  and that Pakistan's armed forces have been authorised to undertake corresponding action. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=27.36s)]
*  India said it hit nine sites, targeting what it described as terrorist infrastructure. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=32.68s)]
*  It said no military facilities had been attacked. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=37.64s)]
*  It also says 10 civilians were killed by Pakistan shelling [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  on the Indian side of the de facto border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=44.08s)]
*  Tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours have escalated since last month's attack [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=50.0s)]
*  in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 26 civilians were killed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=54.72s)]
*  India accuses Pakistan of backing cross-border terrorism, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=59.4s)]
*  a charge Islamabad strongly denies. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=62.92s)]
*  While in Musafrabad, in the main city in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=66.6s)]
*  troops cordoned off streets around that mosque that Islamabad said was hit by an Indian missile. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=70.76s)]
*  U.C. Urdu's Farhat Javad sent this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Just a few metres from here is the Bilal Mosque, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=80.08s)]
*  which was one of the targets of Indian strikes last night. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=84.48s)]
*  This whole area has been cordoned off. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=88.28s)]
*  There is a heavy presence of the troops of Pakistan Army and other security forces here [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=90.48s)]
*  who are not allowing anyone to go past this point. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=95.32s)]
*  The building of the mosque has been completely damaged. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=100.72s)]
*  We can see debris and large fragments of metal rooftops scattered everywhere. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=103.88s)]
*  You can see one metal piece here as well. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=109.64s)]
*  These are the scenes that we have seen almost everywhere. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  Not only the building of this mosque was damaged, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=116.36s)]
*  but some of the houses which were very close to the mosque, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=118.48s)]
*  they are also partially damaged. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=121.84s)]
*  Most of the residents had left last night. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=124.0s)]
*  Some of them had managed to come back today to assess the damages to their properties [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=128.28s)]
*  and also lock their doors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=133.0s)]
*  I have spoken to some of them who say that they were fast asleep [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=135.24s)]
*  when they heard explosions and they saw huge sparks of light [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=137.92s)]
*  when the missiles struck this building. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  One of them says that we were sleeping when we heard the first blast. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=146.32s)]
*  He says that we ran out of our homes with our families and children. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=150.44s)]
*  The kids were terrified and shocked and everyone was screaming. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=154.88s)]
*  Another resident I have spoken with says that the streets were filled with people [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  fleeing in fear and unsure of what was happening. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=164.88s)]
*  A sense of fear, uncertainty and trauma is not limited to this part only. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=168.36s)]
*  But as we walk through the city, we can see that the impact of this attack [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=173.44s)]
*  on everyday life is quite visible. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=178.44s)]
*  Streets are quiet, but the atmosphere is quite tense [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=181.88s)]
*  and people are trying to make sense of what happened last night. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=185.28s)]
*  Thanks to Farhat for that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  India says the missile strikes are in response to a deadly attack [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=191.84s)]
*  on Indian tourists in Bihar last month. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=195.44s)]
*  The whole country is happy that we took revenge. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  Our country gave a befitting reply to those who killed innocent people. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  Our enemy countries should get this message. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=215.68s)]
*  We have information from every corner. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  And if we have to take more such action in the future, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=221.12s)]
*  we will do so with more strength. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=224.56s)]
*  Well, our correspondent, Samira Hussain, is in Delhi. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=229.0s)]
*  She told us more about the response from the Indian government so far. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, we actually heard for the first time from the Indian government [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=236.16s)]
*  and officials from the Indian military. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=239.56s)]
*  It was the first time that we had heard anything from them in person [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=241.6s)]
*  after the overnight attacks. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=245.56s)]
*  They put up maps and showed details in terms of where they attacked last night [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and beyond that area. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  They said that the nine targets were actually militant training camps. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=258.2s)]
*  They were operating these training camps and even were housing weapons. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=264.52s)]
*  And India said that those were their sole targets, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=269.24s)]
*  that they successfully destroyed those targets [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=272.44s)]
*  and they specifically picked those areas because there were no civilian... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=275.32s)]
*  that there wouldn't be any civilian casualties, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=280.36s)]
*  which India says that there weren't any civilian casualties. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=282.16s)]
*  Of course, Pakistan denies all of this, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=285.64s)]
*  denies that there were militants operating in the areas that they targeted. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=288.36s)]
*  And they have said already that dozens of civilians have been killed [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  in those strikes and even more have been injured. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=297.08s)]
*  So it's a lot of what you're hearing from Pakistan, from India rather, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=299.56s)]
*  being countered by Pakistan and vice versa. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzSDG2qTzC8&t=304.0s)]
