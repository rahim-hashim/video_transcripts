# Joe Biden pardons his family in final moments of presidency. #US #JoeBiden #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA)
*  One of Joe Biden's final acts as president was to pardon several members of his own family, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=0.0s)]
*  including his brothers and sister. That's legal forgiveness for most crimes previously committed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=5.68s)]
*  However, he has said it should not be taken as any acknowledgement of wrongdoing on their part. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=10.8s)]
*  So he hopes a pardon will clear them from baseless investigations as Donald Trump enters office, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=16.16s)]
*  and instead has said that his family has been subject to unrelated threats and attacks. Biden [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=22.56s)]
*  has also previously pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing sentencing for two criminal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=28.0s)]
*  cases. But Trump's spokesperson has called the pardons a serious attack on America's justice [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=33.76s)]
*  system. While some Democrats warn it could set a dangerous precedent for outgoing presidents. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=38.96s)]
*  Biden also pardoned Dr. Anthony Fauci, who managed the country's COVID-19 response, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=44.0s)]
*  and some people who investigated and testified the January 6th riots. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Presidential pardons have been used by both parties. Trump issued 143 in his first term, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=54.08s)]
*  and President Barack Obama issued 212 over his two terms. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4DfMQ_lDA&t=60.32s)]
