# Austria holds vigil for Graz school shooting victims | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs)
*  Police in Austria say the lone gunman who shot dead 10 people at a school in the city of Graz [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=0.0s)]
*  before killing himself left a farewell letter and a non-functioning pipe bomb at his home [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=5.92s)]
*  before carrying out the attack. Hundreds of people have gathered for a vigil for the victims of what's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=11.92s)]
*  the deadliest gun attack in the country's recent history. It marked the start of three days of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=17.52s)]
*  national mourning. The 21-year-old gunman was a former pupil at the school. He used two firearms, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=23.04s)]
*  both of which were legally owned. Let's go over to our correspondent there in Graz, Bethany Bell. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=28.48s)]
*  Bethany, just give us the latest from police. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=34.32s)]
*  Well, the police are telling us they found a farewell letter at his home, as you said, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=40.32s)]
*  but that letter didn't reveal, they said, any motivation for this attack. This man, a 21-year-old [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Austrian citizen who lived quite close to Graz, was a former student here at the school. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=54.88s)]
*  Yesterday morning at around 10 o'clock when classes were in full flow, he appeared at the school [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=60.88s)]
*  with two guns, a shotgun and a handgun that he legally owned and opened fire before he then killed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=68.0s)]
*  himself, we understand, in a school bathroom. Investigations are continuing, the police say, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=77.04s)]
*  to try to get to the bottom of this terrible, terrible attack. And here at the school, people [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=83.28s)]
*  have been arriving, they've been laying flowers in front of the school gates. You can see behind me, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=89.12s)]
*  there's a sort of a barrier area for their privacy as they lay flowers there. People have put up [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=94.72s)]
*  banners, one saying, Graz stands together. This is a real moment of mourning and grief for the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=102.56s)]
*  people in Graz and the whole country. How much information has been given at this stage about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=109.84s)]
*  who the victims are? Very little. The authorities say they're keen to preserve the privacy of people [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=116.16s)]
*  who are mourning their dead and also people who have relatives who are in hospital, some with [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=126.16s)]
*  serious injuries after this attack. There are unconfirmed reports that a number of those [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  who were shot in this incident had leg injuries. We hope that there may be more details as the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=140.56s)]
*  hours to come, but for the moment, there is a real sense of solidarity here. People who live in this [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=149.2s)]
*  area have been telling me about their disbelief that they can't believe something like this could [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=155.36s)]
*  have happened here in this area, which they say is usually so quiet, beautiful and safe. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=160.24s)]
*  But this whole incident has actually raised a debate about Austria's gun laws. They're more [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=165.68s)]
*  liberal than a number of European Union countries. Gun ownership is comparatively high. There are an [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  estimated 1.5 million guns registered in Austria. That's in a population of around nine million [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  people. There have been calls, voices so far saying that it is simply too easy to get hold of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=186.88s)]
*  a gun. Until yesterday, Austria had escaped largely the kind of mass shootings that other [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  countries have seen, but now this incident has changed that entirely. Bethany, thank you very [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=200.64s)]
*  much. Bethany Bell in Graz. We can look at some of the pictures, other shots that we have at this [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=207.92s)]
*  school. The Draia-Sch√ºtzen-Gasse secondary school in the northwest of Graz. Six females, three males [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=215.28s)]
*  killed in the attack and a seventh female died later in hospital during the day yesterday. You [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=222.96s)]
*  can see the screen that police have put up there in front of the school and in other shots we've [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=229.84s)]
*  seen a steady stream of people coming to the school to pay their respects and as Bethany was [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=236.88s)]
*  outlining, the absolute shock not just there in Graz and the immediate vicinity of this terrible [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=242.24s)]
*  event but across Austria. People finding it very hard to believe that something like this has [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  happened. It is not something they are used to but just to update you that line from police, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=256.8s)]
*  they say they found a farewell letter and a non-functional pipe bomb during the search of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=262.64s)]
*  the suspect's home. No motive has yet been given. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZZevWWIzs&t=269.2s)]
