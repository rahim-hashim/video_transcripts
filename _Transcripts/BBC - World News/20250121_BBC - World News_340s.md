# President Zelensky speaking at Davos | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA)
*  Straighten out Davos in Switzerland at the meeting of the World Economic Forum. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukraine's President Zelensky is speaking. Let's listen then. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=3.36s)]
*  It's not by chance that our strategic priorities and our priorities must match the challenge in politics and in defense and in economy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=30.0s)]
*  Such threats can only be counted and only counted together. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=51.36s)]
*  Even when it comes to army size, Russia can field about 1.3 or maybe 1.5 million troops. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  We've got more than 800,000 in our military. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=65.28s)]
*  Second after us comes France with over 200,000. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=70.56s)]
*  Then Germany, Italy and UK. Everyone else has less. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=76.0s)]
*  This isn't a situation where one country can secure itself alone. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=81.84s)]
*  It's about all of us standing together to mean something. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  For now, thankfully, the influence of Iran's regime is weakening. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=96.48s)]
*  This gives hope for Syria and Lebanon and they should too become examples of how life can recover after war. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=101.2s)]
*  Ukraine is already stepping in to support the new Syria. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=110.0s)]
*  Our ministers have been to Damascus and we've launched a food aid program for Syria called Food from Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  We are getting our partners involved to invest in these deliveries and in building food production facilities. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=123.76s)]
*  And Europe could totally step in as a security donor for Syria time to stop getting headaches from that direction. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=132.4s)]
*  And Europe together with America should put paid to the Iranian threat. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=142.32s)]
*  Next, right now, it's not clear whether Europe will even have a seat at the table when the war against our country ends. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  And we see how much influence China has on Russia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  And we are deeply grateful to Europe for all the support it's given our country during this war. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=163.36s)]
*  But will President Trump listen to Europe or will he negotiate with Russia and China without Europe? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=170.88s)]
*  Europe needs to learn how to fully take care of itself so that the world can't afford to ignore it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=180.24s)]
*  It's vital to maintain unity in Europe because the world doesn't care about just Budapest or Brussels. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=189.52s)]
*  It cares about Europe as a whole. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  And we need a united European security and defence policy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=201.68s)]
*  And all European countries must be willing to spend as much on security as it truly needed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=207.44s)]
*  Not just as much as they have gotten used to during years of neglect. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=215.04s)]
*  If it takes 5% of GDP to cover defence, then so be it. 5% it is. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=220.88s)]
*  And there is no need to play with people's emotions that defence should be compensated at the expense of medicine or pensions or something else. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=228.72s)]
*  That's really not fair. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=240.48s)]
*  We have already set up models of cooperation for Ukraine's defence that can make all of Europe stronger. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=244.72s)]
*  We are building drones together, including some totally unique ones that no one else in the world has. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  And we are producing artillery together in Ukraine. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=262.08s)]
*  And it's much cheaper and faster than in any other country in the world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=265.52s)]
*  And investing now in Ukrainian drones production is investing not only in security of Europe, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=271.12s)]
*  but the ability of Europe to be a security guarantor for other vital regions. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=277.52s)]
*  And we need to start building the air defence systems together. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=285.12s)]
*  But that can actually handle all types of tourism and holistic interests. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=289.52s)]
*  Which is the whole version of the Irish. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=295.36s)]
*  Something that can deal with the times. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=299.6s)]
*  And what we have just seen him address is the influence that Europe needs to have now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=303.92s)]
*  Will President Trump even listen to Europe? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=311.6s)]
*  He said Europe needs to take care of itself and maintain unity when it comes to defence. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=314.16s)]
*  We hear this often from President Zelensky, but he is calling on his European partners as well to ramp up their support for his country's war against Russia. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=319.12s)]
*  He had said on Monday he was hopeful that Donald Trump would help achieve a just peace. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  But what he's calling for here at the World Economic Forum is for countries in Europe to spend 5% of their GDP on defence. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PclnVd3gsSA&t=332.64000000000004s)]
