# Is Donald Trump losing public support? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo)
*  I hope you've managed to catch our series 100 Days of Donald Trump. If you haven't heard it, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=0.0s)]
*  or you haven't heard every episode, they are all available on BBC Sounds or wherever you get your [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=4.48s)]
*  podcasts. What does the man himself think of his first 100 days of his second term? Here he is with [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=10.16s)]
*  his assessment. It was at a rally in Michigan on Tuesday. And we're here tonight in the heartland [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=16.48s)]
*  of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=23.28s)]
*  history of our country. And that's according to many, many people. This is the best, they say, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=30.64s)]
*  100-day start of any president in history. And everyone is saying it. We've just gotten started. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  You haven't even seen anything yet. It's all just kicking in. But for all the great things he says [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=45.36s)]
*  he's done, for all the things he is promising in the immediate future, it is a simple fact that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=52.16s)]
*  his approval ratings in the American public seem to be dropping. And that particularly because of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=56.72s)]
*  the things he has done on the economy. How much does it matter? How much does he care? Welcome to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=63.04s)]
*  We will need to talk about in the days and hours ahead. But anyway, this is a snapshot at any rate [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=99.04s)]
*  of what's going on at the moment. And let us begin with that Michigan rally that Donald Trump held. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  So the first 100 days in office, that's the clip of the rally that you heard in the pre-intro there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  And Sarah, you were in Michigan as well. Yes, I went up there because that was the first rally [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  he's had since he returned to the White House. So it was quite an event to go to. And I'll tell you [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=123.28s)]
*  what was fascinating was although the Trump supporters who were there were really, really [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=127.92s)]
*  enthusiastic, absolutely delighted to get to see him in campaign mode once again, it wasn't that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=132.72s)]
*  busy. There were not queues running around the block hours before the doors opened. Like we saw [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=138.8s)]
*  during the campaign, there were empty seats inside the auditorium. It just didn't quite have the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  size and the scale of the events that we all went to during the election. I guess that isn't a huge [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=148.88s)]
*  surprise, right? I mean, the enthusiasms of campaigns get everyone really engaged and they [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=153.68s)]
*  had one singular focus that they had and that was unseating the Democrats from the White House. Now, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=158.88s)]
*  Republicans are being pulled in a bunch of different directions. And perhaps there's some [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=166.4s)]
*  concern about the direction that Donald Trump is taking the country. And I thought, you know, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=170.72s)]
*  there were plenty of the hallmarks in the performance in the whole speech of classic [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=176.24s)]
*  Donald Trump. He was quite funny on occasions. He kind of meandered off into places that his [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=180.88s)]
*  speech writers certainly would have been surprised that he got to, etc., etc. All the kind of, all [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=186.32s)]
*  the things that we're really used to. But there are a couple of things that were interesting, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=190.48s)]
*  particularly, I thought, and one of them was this focus on the polls, because that does go, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  doesn't it, to whether he is or is not genuinely in the mood to change now as a result of what [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=200.48s)]
*  seems to be his growing unpopularity. So among the many, very many enemies he brought up, and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=208.24s)]
*  Joe Biden was there and all the rest of it, Bernie Sanders even made it on, although he's not much [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=214.32s)]
*  of a threat to Donald Trump in the modern political era. But there we go. Fake polls. It was really [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=220.32s)]
*  interesting that it was the polls that he took issue with. Let's have a listen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's why we got, despite the fake polls, you know, they do these polls where they interview [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=232.48s)]
*  far more Democrats than Republicans. I saw them over the last few days and I had them checked out. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=237.28s)]
*  They interview far more Democrats for the polls. They interview Democrats by big numbers and then [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=243.44s)]
*  Republicans by small. They say Trump only has a 44% approval rating. Well, it's actually not bad. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=249.68s)]
*  But when you figure that if it were a legit poll, it would be in the 60s or 70s. These people are a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=257.2s)]
*  bunch of crooked people. What do we make of that? Well, I'm not sure which poll he's referring to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=263.2s)]
*  here. It might be the Reuters Ipsos poll, which showed him with an approval rating in the low 40s [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=270.64s)]
*  and actually an approval in his handling of the economy, which used to be a strength for Donald [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=276.24s)]
*  Trump in the 30s. But it wasn't just that poll that has shown Donald Trump dip in his approval. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=280.64s)]
*  And, you know, polls vary by their methodology. And I think the interesting thing to take from [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=287.84s)]
*  these polls is that they do show a trend where Donald Trump was higher. He even had a net positive [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=291.84s)]
*  approval rate in some of these polls. And now all of them are moving to net negative. But, you know, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  I can understand why Donald Trump would say, ah, these polls are meaningless. They're fake because [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=303.2s)]
*  we saw polls as we've all discussed in the run up to the 2024 presidential election that showed [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=306.64s)]
*  Kamala Harris maybe narrowly ahead is certainly a dead heat. And then Donald Trump ended up winning [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=312.32s)]
*  reasonably comfortably. So it's understandable that he might treat this with a bit of skepticism [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  and also understandable that he's worried that if people start believing these polls, it will [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=324.8s)]
*  undermine his political authority and power and ability to get things done. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=329.2s)]
*  It goes by some measures in these polls. He's got actually historically low approval ratings. The ABC [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=333.44s)]
*  News Washington Post poll that found just 39 percent of Americans approving of his performance, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=339.36s)]
*  that put him at the lowest point at this point in a presidential term of anybody for 80 years. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=344.24s)]
*  And the second lowest was Donald Trump in his first third lowest Joe Biden. What I found really [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=350.88s)]
*  fascinating about this is so for one thing, a lot of these polls have tiny numbers of people who [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=356.8s)]
*  voted for Donald Trump saying that they regret it like four percent, six percent in some polls. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=362.72s)]
*  So you've got more than half the country voted for him. More than half the country think that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=367.2s)]
*  he's not doing a good job. But very, very few people say that they would vote differently if [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=371.84s)]
*  they could have a do over in November. And I mean, non-scientifically, completely anecdotally, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  I phone back a few Trump voters that I met during the course of the campaign last year. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=381.28s)]
*  And I spoke to a bunch of folks in Michigan when we quite deliberately [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=386.4s)]
*  visited a county that had voted for Donald Trump to find people who'd voted for him. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=390.4s)]
*  And everyone I spoke to was pretty enthusiastic about how he was doing. Certainly wouldn't have [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=394.96s)]
*  changed their mind. And if there were things that they had trouble with, like someone unsure [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=399.2s)]
*  about whether the tariffs would really work out, they said, give it some time. It's only been [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  a hundred days. Nobody could fix the economy in that amount of time. So, I mean, of course, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=407.68s)]
*  science versus anecdote. Obviously, you would go with the bigger and more scientifically [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=412.24s)]
*  weighted polls. But just my personal experience is that doesn't seem to be that much buyers [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  remorse from Trump voters. What do you think, Anthony? Yeah, I think Donald Trump's base, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=420.32s)]
*  we have seen, will stick with him. And they very reluctantly second-guess things that he's done. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=424.64s)]
*  I mean, he has that 30 to 40 percent of the American public that will ride and die with him. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  So that's going to be his floor, I think. And then it's a matter of how many other people, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  independents, Democrats, he can get to be on his side. And he certainly won enough of those [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  in last year's presidential election, the only poll that really matters, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=450.56s)]
*  to get the presidency, get the White House back. But I think it is its perception that is the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  danger here, because Republicans, unlike Donald Trump, are going to have to stand for a re-election [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=461.28s)]
*  next year. There are even some in state races that will have to stand for re-election this November. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  And if they start feeling like Donald Trump is not popular and that he's pulling them down, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  that's when you will see them start to break from the president. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=479.28s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And when you say this November, it's New Jersey and Virginia, isn't it? These [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  governor's races, these sort of off-year governor's races, and the Virginia one in particular. So, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  you know, as a Republican governor of Virginia at the moment, if that is turned around and if the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=494.23999999999995s)]
*  Democrat wins and wins big, it seems to me that that is when you can put the opinion poll all to [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  one side, in a sense, because now you've got proper, real evidence, hard and fast evidence [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=508.88s)]
*  in an election of people changing. And that is the moment where it seems to me that for Donald [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=515.12s)]
*  Trump, all of this crystallizes into the bigger question, do you change as a result of your [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  waning popularity, or do you not change, or do you double down, or what do you do, etc. It seems to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=528.16s)]
*  me that November is the moment when that really happens. I'll say something about Donald Trump's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=532.48s)]
*  specific critiquing of polls, too, because he's saying, oh, they're asking more Democrats than [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=537.84s)]
*  Republicans, and that makes these polls bunk. And most polls don't wait for party ID, because party [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=541.6s)]
*  ID fluctuates, it shifts. People say they're independent, but they're really Republicans, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=548.08s)]
*  say they're Republicans, but they're really independent, say they're Democrats, but they're [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  not. So, it's tricky to try to weight it that way. Same with recalled vote for the previous election. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=556.72s)]
*  A lot of people will either lie or misremember about who they voted for, or will say, oh, I [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=564.4s)]
*  didn't really vote for that person because that person is no longer popular, they don't like what [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=568.64s)]
*  they did, or they say they did vote for someone because they want to have been on the winning team. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  Polling, as we've discussed in the past, there's a little bit of art to it, a little bit of science [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  to it. And so, it is kind of a challenge to get it just right. But just to say, well, they asked more [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=582.16s)]
*  Democrats than Republicans in this, that makes the results of these polls meaningless. I think [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=589.76s)]
*  that's going a step too far. Do you think people are reluctant to tell pollsters that they made a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=594.88s)]
*  mistake with their vote? So, if you do find somebody who says that they voted for Donald Trump, you say, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  do you regret it now? And they say, no. Is that because they don't like to admit they were wrong [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=602.96s)]
*  a few months ago? You know, when you ask someone if they've been scammed or fallen for a crime or [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=607.2s)]
*  some sort of hoodwink somehow, you have to admit that you made a mistake, that it's your error. And [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=611.12s)]
*  so, I think it's kind of human nature in any kind of a situation like that, whether it's voting for [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=617.2s)]
*  someone who now you regret or doing something that you regret. It's just difficult to kind of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=622.0s)]
*  acknowledge that, particularly to a stranger who calls you on a phone or, you know, punching in [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=627.5200000000001s)]
*  numbers on a phone or on online survey to be able to have that kind of, you know, self-awareness to [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=630.96s)]
*  do it. I can't remember which polling company it is, but one of them asks the question regularly, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=637.5200000000001s)]
*  or asked it at least once, somewhere down in the weeds of the poll, asks the question, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=643.76s)]
*  do you currently have a captain's license to drive a nuclear-powered submarine? And to which [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=648.64s)]
*  the answer should be, and it should come back as zero, pretty much, because so few people do, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=656.4s)]
*  that in any poll. But actually, kind of they were getting sort of 20%, particularly of men, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=660.56s)]
*  saying, yeah, I think I probably do have that at the moment. In other words, you know, Trump is [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=666.48s)]
*  onto something where he says they're not necessarily reliable, but it's just not in the way that he [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=672.0s)]
*  suggests. They're not trying to be skewed. That's the point, isn't it? You make money from polling [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=676.48s)]
*  by being accurate. That's the point. Right, exactly. There's no political agenda behind it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=681.12s)]
*  Or, I mean, there's some polls that do have a tilt one way or the other, and I think we have [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=685.92s)]
*  to acknowledge that. But yeah, there is value in trying to be right. And I think most polls, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=690.0s)]
*  most ones that we talk about, the mainstream pollsters that we see out there, they are ones who [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=696.16s)]
*  are doing their best to try to get it right, because it's their reputations on the line. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=702.32s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, in any poll, there's 10% who believe in aliens or believe they've been [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=706.56s)]
*  abducted by aliens. And so when you start to get down into those low numbers, I think anything below [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=711.68s)]
*  20% approval for something, and you can say that it's universally hated whether there's 10% of [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=716.96s)]
*  people who say they like something totally strange or bizarre. Donald Trump flew back from Michigan on [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=725.12s)]
*  Tuesday night, landed back at the White House on Marine One to find another set of numbers that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=731.84s)]
*  were not good for him. And these are harder to dispute when it is the Bureau of Economic Analysis [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=736.72s)]
*  coming out with the quarterly GDP numbers, the gross domestic product numbers, i.e. the total [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  of goods and services in the US economy, January, February, March of this year, pretty important [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  numbers. And they showed that the economy had shrunk very slightly by 0.3%. But that's a fairly [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=755.6s)]
*  precipitous drop from almost 2.5% growth in the previous quarter. That's pretty difficult for him [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=760.4s)]
*  to try and explain. Yeah, I think the thing that's particularly concerning for this for Trump is that [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=766.4s)]
*  end of March, this was before the latest trade drama. This is before the Liberation Day, where [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=771.84s)]
*  he announced these massive tariffs that he has since walked back to some extent on so many different [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=777.36s)]
*  countries all over the world. There is some critique of these numbers that a lot of reflects [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=783.92s)]
*  the fact that companies were stocking up on inventory and importing a lot more goods to [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=789.6s)]
*  prepare for the prospect of tariffs. And that drove down growth rates showing up in this. And [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  there are other measures that will probably show that the economy still grew a little bit. But it [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  is signs of weakness in this economy and signs should be signs of concern given that we're now [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  dealing with these tariffs. And we're now dealing with dropping consumer confidence and possibly [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=811.84s)]
*  rising prices because of the tariffs that the economy is heading in the wrong direction. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=816.08s)]
*  Yeah, it seems to me the real problem for him is not quarter one, it's quarter two of this [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=821.44s)]
*  year where all this begins to unwind. So quarter one, exactly as you're saying, Anthony, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=825.5200000000001s)]
*  GDP is basically everything, all economic activity minus what comes in in the way of imports. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=829.9200000000001s)]
*  And there were a lot of imports because people were preparing for Liberation Day, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=836.96s)]
*  which was what was it April the second, I think, so the beginning of the next quarter, but people [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=840.96s)]
*  were well aware that it was on its way. And they were stocking up on inventory. So that huge amount [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=846.24s)]
*  of imports, extra amount of imports might be responsible for at least some of that drop in [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=851.2s)]
*  output because people were busy stocking up on stuff from abroad. But in quarter two, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=858.72s)]
*  you won't be able to talk about that to the same extent. And what you will be able to talk about [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=865.36s)]
*  is, for instance, the trucker whose job is to bring stuff from the Port of Los Angeles or Seattle [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=870.5600000000001s)]
*  across America and drop it off at Target or Walmart or wherever. And there is nothing to come, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=878.72s)]
*  there's nothing to put in the truck and the trucker loses his job or her job and doesn't spend so much [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=885.44s)]
*  on, I don't know. What truckers eat and drink. Yeah, they eat and drink. And they then, that means [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=892.48s)]
*  the company that produces that piece of produce that isn't so much consumed itself lays people [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=899.52s)]
*  off, perhaps gets rid of one shift, et cetera, et cetera. It's those sorts of things. It's those [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=905.52s)]
*  knock-on effects that slow an economy down that it seems to me could mean that there will be [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=909.36s)]
*  another quarter of negative growth and two quarters of negative growth, of course, mean that is [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=916.8000000000001s)]
*  officially a recession. And that is something that will really sting Donald Trump because it [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=924.24s)]
*  will be a word or they will fight against it. And we know already the sort of things they'll say [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=929.84s)]
*  about it. But we know that as well, it will really hurt him to have people talking about a Donald [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=933.84s)]
*  Trump recession, which is what it will be. Right. Well, he'll try and blame Joe Biden, of course. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=940.24s)]
*  I mean, he said that the bad figures that were released this week were Biden's fault, nothing to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=945.36s)]
*  do with him, even though he was in office for over two of those three months. Now, there's a [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=950.8s)]
*  certain amount of truth to say that there is a lag in the economy and no president could come in [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=955.12s)]
*  on the 20th of January and completely turn it around, although it is his threat of tariffs that [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  meant there was that surge in imports. It'll be much harder, obviously, in six months, three months [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=964.64s)]
*  time after nearly six months in office to blame Joe Biden for all of that. But I heard Donald Trump [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  say the most extraordinary thing yesterday that really, really took me aback when he was talking [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=976.72s)]
*  about this economic slowdown at his cabinet meeting. President Xi of China. Look, right now, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=980.8000000000001s)]
*  and I told you before, they're having tremendous difficulty because their factories are not doing [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=989.76s)]
*  business. They made a trillion dollars with Biden, a trillion dollars, even a trillion won [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=994.96s)]
*  with Biden selling this stuff. Much of it we don't need. You know, somebody said, oh, the shelves [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1001.44s)]
*  are going to be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1008.24s)]
*  and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. But [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1013.84s)]
*  we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. They have ships that are [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1018.24s)]
*  loaded up with stuff, much of which not all of it, but much of which we don't need. And we have to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1023.0400000000001s)]
*  make a fair deal. We've been ripped off by every country in the world. But China, I would say, is [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1029.92s)]
*  the leading, the leading one, the leading candidate for the chief ripper offer. Look, there are lots [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1035.28s)]
*  and lots of people who would argue for very many reasons from environmental ones to childhood [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1043.44s)]
*  development ones that maybe you don't need to have 30 dollars. But that is completely antithetical to [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1047.44s)]
*  the entire point of the American consumerist economy and American dream. Can you imagine, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1052.3200000000002s)]
*  can you imagine Joe Biden coming out during the heart of the inflation surge and saying, well, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1058.32s)]
*  you know, yes, prices are going up, but Americans, they'll just have to learn how to get by with less. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1063.52s)]
*  I mean, he would have been torn apart. They would have dragged him out of the White House. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1068.8s)]
*  Fewer Barbies all around. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  And paraded him down the street. Yeah, Donald Trump is trying to blame this on Biden. But really, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1073.76s)]
*  turn what around? I mean, the economy actually was doing really, really well by these same metrics [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1081.4399999999998s)]
*  over the past year. And maybe people weren't feeling it because they still kind of felt the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1086.48s)]
*  lingering effects of inflation. But but growth was great, as you mentioned, two percent the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1090.32s)]
*  previous quarter. And actually, Donald Trump a year ago, January of 2020, was trying to take credit [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1095.76s)]
*  for the stock market boom in the economy, saying that it was really Donald Trump's stock market in [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1101.84s)]
*  January of twenty, twenty, twenty four, saying that this was Donald Trump's stock market, not [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1107.28s)]
*  Joe Biden's. And he should get credit for all of this growth. So now a year later, when he is [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1112.88s)]
*  actually president, he's saying, no, no, the things that are going wrong are in Biden's lap. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1117.8400000000001s)]
*  Justin, I don't want to worry you, but the general perception has been that if you can only have two [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  dolls, it won't be Barbie and Ken. It'll be two Barbies. And that the real victim of a doll squeeze [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1127.44s)]
*  is going to be that the Kens are going to be left on the shelves. Well, that's a shocker. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1134.88s)]
*  I mean, all I know is I came back from the US after a decade there with young children with [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1139.68s)]
*  a lot of Barbies that I think are still in the attic and the idea that you could be limited to [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1146.32s)]
*  two, I find genuinely shocking. And I mean, I agree. I just the you've got to get your story [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1150.32s)]
*  straight in the end, haven't you? Either you say to Americans up front, look, you're a consumerist [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1157.1200000000001s)]
*  idiots. You're buying loads of stuff you don't need. Stop doing it. Which is which is an approach, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1161.6000000000001s)]
*  as Anthony suggests, not necessarily a great approach. And or you say, hang on a second, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1166.88s)]
*  we'll go through some tough times, but actually you have as many Barbies as you like, maybe [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1175.68s)]
*  next year. And Trump Trump himself put on truth social, didn't he? Patience in in in all caps, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1180.0800000000002s)]
*  all caps. The idea that people you know, there's going to be a temporary turmoil, then you'll get [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1186.48s)]
*  back to to to normal, which led me to think if you ever met any Americans, because I don't think [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1191.36s)]
*  patients particularly the American consumer is not a patient person, it seems to me, but there you [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1197.04s)]
*  go. But they got to decide one way or the other. And the idea that you just say, suddenly, okay, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1202.32s)]
*  let's not be consumerist anymore. I mean, it just seems to me to be mad. Yeah, they're saying both, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1206.56s)]
*  basically, they're saying don't be consumerist. And this is only temporary. And it's not really [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1211.1999999999998s)]
*  a problem. And actually, the economy is going great. I mean, they're throwing everything out [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1214.8799999999999s)]
*  there, which risks coming across as what they don't know what what's going on. They're out of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1218.48s)]
*  touch, or it's just a muddled mess. But you know, you mentioned truckers and there is tangible [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1224.0s)]
*  evidence now in shipping numbers that these giant shipping containers that are coming over from [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1228.96s)]
*  China are coming over empty or half full that there is going to be in the coming weeks, a very [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1234.56s)]
*  significant drop in the number of goods entering this country because all these Chinese manufacturers [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1240.0s)]
*  have shuttered their factories or delayed sending things because they don't know whether there are [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1245.2s)]
*  going to be tariffs on their products or not. So that will have an effect on dock workers unloading [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1249.6000000000001s)]
*  or not unloading crates. So that'll have an effect on these truck drivers, as you mentioned, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1256.0s)]
*  who are driving all over the country delivering the goods. But then it's going to have an effect [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1260.88s)]
*  on retailers who won't have any kind of goods to sell. They're going to be, if there are, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1264.0s)]
*  and it looks like there will be empty store shelves, that is something that maybe Americans [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1269.04s)]
*  feel even more than seeing a fraction of a percent decline in the GDP numbers for quarter one. And [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1273.68s)]
*  it's going forward, these things have long tails. So this could even be something that has fallout [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1281.28s)]
*  for Christmas or for fireworks in the Fourth of July. I mean, these are things that will not be [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1286.3200000000002s)]
*  turned around overnight. And that is going to be a very real problem for Donald Trump. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1291.1200000000001s)]
*  So then the question is, Sarah, is he going to bin it? I mean, are we going to see a complete [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1296.3200000000002s)]
*  U-turn? The whole thing junked? I wouldn't put it past him because he's been he's been weaving [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1299.52s)]
*  and dodging all over with his tariffs policy. I mean, when it comes to retailers, and Anthony [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1306.4s)]
*  was just talking about their Walmart, Home Depot, Target, they were all in the White House last week, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1312.08s)]
*  warning genuinely of empty shelves if they didn't take some kind of action. And up until now, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1317.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's been brushing that off. And we know that now is when retailers are ordering for [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1323.36s)]
*  Christmas. And if you speak to smaller, independently owned stores, they say they just [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1327.92s)]
*  don't know what they're doing. They're not ordering their Christmas stock or they're not producing [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1332.0s)]
*  their catalogs. They can't price their goods for Christmas. They just don't know what's going to [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1335.52s)]
*  happen with Christmas. So I think if there's a genuine fear about that, he may well change [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1339.6000000000001s)]
*  time because look at what he did on tariffs on car parts already. Just at the beginning of this week, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1344.16s)]
*  he suddenly changed his tune and you are no longer going to have to pay tariffs if you're [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1350.4s)]
*  importing certain kinds of metals like aluminium and car parts that are made of that, you won't [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1355.28s)]
*  pay a double tariff. So basically, he's making it easier to import foreign made car parts. Now, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1360.0s)]
*  this is somebody who made a huge deal when he introduced these tariffs about returning car [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1364.6399999999999s)]
*  manufacturing to America. Now, lots and lots of companies said, hey, we do make our cars in America, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1369.04s)]
*  but we import some of the car parts. Even Elon Musk and Tesla import some of the parts that it [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1374.3999999999999s)]
*  takes to build their cars. They were brushed off to start with. And we even had cabinet secretaries [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  saying they didn't want German car manufacturers here in America where people just assembled their [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1384.8s)]
*  German cars. Those weren't good enough American jobs. Well, that's all changed now because [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1389.44s)]
*  obviously there was going to be a real tangible effect. And so suddenly he can ease these tariffs [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1394.08s)]
*  on car parts today. It'll be something else tomorrow. There is a lot of weaving and dodging [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1398.48s)]
*  around on the tariff policy. The risk, of course, is that you can't count on that. You can't plan [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1404.32s)]
*  your business strategy based on, well, maybe he'll change his mind right before things really go [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1409.76s)]
*  south. And so all of these companies are sitting here trying to plot out what they're going to do. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1415.76s)]
*  And they are paring back their investments. They are paring back their production. They are trying [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1420.08s)]
*  to rely less on imports because they don't know what's going on. And that's been the real challenge [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1424.32s)]
*  from the very beginning for this. Donald Trump could have laid out like, these are the tariffs. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1429.76s)]
*  This is how it's going to come in. It's going to be gradual, which I think is exactly what Scott [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1434.4s)]
*  Peasant, the Secretary of Treasury, was advising him to do. But he listened to other people like [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1438.48s)]
*  Peter Navarro, who were saying, no, you got to go big, hit hard, make a big splash. And so that's [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1444.96s)]
*  why you get this big splash and then paddling back and then trying to ramp them up again and [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1450.24s)]
*  then being worried about. And that is just, it's a dangerous way to conduct any kind of economic [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1456.16s)]
*  policy. Let's focus for a moment now on opposition to Donald Trump. And in the form of one [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1461.84s)]
*  particular opponent of his, a big opponent at the last election who lost to him. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1467.92s)]
*  We all know President Trump and his administration and their allies are counting on the notion [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1475.68s)]
*  that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1483.76s)]
*  that if they make some people afraid, it will have a churn effect on others. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1490.56s)]
*  But what they're overlooking, what they've overlooked [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1500.0s)]
*  is that fear is not the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1505.76s)]
*  The courage of Americans who are banding together in the face of the greatest manmade economic crisis [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1512.56s)]
*  in modern presidential history. It was dear Kamala Harris who we haven't heard from for a bit. In [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1528.56s)]
*  fact, this seems to be the first major speech she's made since Donald Trump took over and since she [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1535.6799999999998s)]
*  lost. And it comes at an interesting time because it's a sort of reintroduction of her to the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1542.24s)]
*  American people, but Sarah potentially with a purpose. Well, there's a lot of speculation [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1549.52s)]
*  about whether she's wanting to get back into politics, particularly whether she wants to run [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1553.92s)]
*  for the governor of California. And it's not just a decision that she has to make for her own personal [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1557.76s)]
*  career. She's kind of frozen the democratic race in California with all sorts of other people not [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1563.76s)]
*  wanting to declare that they're going to go if she's going to be running for it. So in some ways, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1568.48s)]
*  it is very important because it's a huge state, obviously. It's a very, very democratic stronghold [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1574.56s)]
*  and it's where a lot of democratic talent comes from as well. So people are watching that, not [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1581.52s)]
*  just then also because it would be very curious to see if she could make a comeback. The response [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1585.84s)]
*  to that speech, I would say people are interested always to hear about the idea that there is a [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1591.2s)]
*  resistance coming to Donald Trump. There's not much evidence of the contagious courage that she's [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1596.56s)]
*  talking about, I don't think so. What do you think, Anthony? I think there are signs certainly on the [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1601.04s)]
*  grassroots level of people starting to become more active. There have been demonstrations today, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  May Day, there are demonstrations around the country. They certainly aren't on the scale [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1612.96s)]
*  that we saw in 2017 after Donald Trump first won the presidency. You've seen some members of [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1617.9199999999998s)]
*  Congress start to get a little bit more traction in criticizing the administration. But again, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1624.48s)]
*  Democrats don't have any power in Congress, so there's only so much they can do. But yeah, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1630.48s)]
*  I think the party and the resistance, if you want to call it that, is looking for a voice, someone [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1636.4s)]
*  out there who can kind of give voice to the anger in the democratic base. And actually, one I want [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1642.48s)]
*  to point out is J.B. Pritzker, who is the governor of Illinois, who went up to New Hampshire, which [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1650.88s)]
*  is a very important state when we come to presidential politics, and gave a fire-breathing [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1655.2s)]
*  speech about how his party needed to resist Republicans all the time and everywhere. And that [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1660.48s)]
*  he's not normally a guy who would be calling for demonstrations. He's kind of a moderate and he's [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1668.0s)]
*  a billionaire. But he was saying, now is the time where we have to draw a line and stand and fight. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1672.72s)]
*  And I think maybe even more than Kamala Harris, he is one to watch for the upcoming kind of [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1677.28s)]
*  auditioning among Democrats to become the voice of the party. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1685.3600000000001s)]
*  Justin, Anthony is saying that, yeah, the Democrats are looking for a voice. The voice we just heard, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1688.96s)]
*  I suspect, is very much not the one they're looking for. Possibly Joe Biden would be the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1693.6000000000001s)]
*  only person less likely to lead the resistance. Who gave us the lead too? And I think no one [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1697.3600000000001s)]
*  really paid attention to that either. The thing is, that courage line, which is very typical of [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1702.0s)]
*  her, isn't it? A Democratic fundraiser, who's not, I should say, a great supporter of hers, but [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1708.16s)]
*  someone I know, was saying to me that she had that courage line. But then who are the two groups who [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1713.76s)]
*  she singled out for showing courage? Number one, she singled out the judges, including this judge [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1719.52s)]
*  who's recently been arrested, who may or may not have committed a criminal offense. But anyway, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1726.16s)]
*  is that really where the Democratic Party wants to be, backing judges, particularly, as showing [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1732.72s)]
*  courage? Rather than their own politicians and their own people? But the other group was the [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1740.08s)]
*  Ivy League universities, who are having this great fight at the moment with the administration. We've [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1744.8s)]
*  talked about this in the past. Again, the rights and the wrongs of it put it to one side. But are [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1749.04s)]
*  they absolutely the most popular thing that mainstream America is up in arms about, trying [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1753.84s)]
*  to make sure that Harvard doesn't get $2 billion taken off its, whatever it is, $53 billion wealth? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1759.6s)]
*  I don't think it is. And what my friend was saying is that, he said, she always manages to [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1766.0s)]
*  get it kind of semi right, and then just go off on this tangent that politically, never mind what [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1773.36s)]
*  you think about it, ethically, morally, but politically, it just doesn't work. Yeah, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1778.1599999999999s)]
*  if your party has been accused of being too much on the side of the elite, speaking out for judges [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1783.76s)]
*  and Harvard University probably doesn't help that perception that much. And the thing about [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1791.52s)]
*  championing judges is that the legal system, the judicial system moves so slowly. And any kind of [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1796.8799999999999s)]
*  victory you win is always going to tend to the, well, it might be appealed. And this is going to [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1801.92s)]
*  be a process that goes out until you get to the Supreme Court. And even then, Supreme Court [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1806.16s)]
*  victories aren't always as clear cut as people would hope that they would be. So it's going to [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1810.64s)]
*  be a challenge. She's not the first person to lose a presidential race. And then two years later, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1816.4s)]
*  if she does run for governor of California, do you know the last one to do that? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1821.68s)]
*  Well, it's Richard Nixon. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1826.64s)]
*  Exactly. And he lost. He lost and had that famous quote, you're not going to have [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1827.92s)]
*  Dick Nixon to kick around anymore. Of course, then another six years later, he ran for president [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1832.0800000000002s)]
*  again and ended up winning. So no matter what Kamala Harris does, she's young, she might be [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1837.2s)]
*  able to find some sort of a political rehabilitation and ultimate victory somewhere down the line. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1841.52s)]
*  The career for politicians can go a long, long time. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, before we go, we've had this email from an Americaster from Isla McCampfil Rose, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1852.64s)]
*  who says, Dear Americast, I'm just on the phone to my gran, Dorothy Rose, discussing the goings on [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1857.6000000000001s)]
*  in the world. 98 years and eight months. She's still as sharp as a pin, an avid BBC sounds [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1863.44s)]
*  listener and maybe your oldest Americaster question mark. She's pretty remarkable either way. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1869.28s)]
*  And there's an emoji of a big grin of the kind that I use. And Mariana tells me it's a sign of [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1874.88s)]
*  age itself to use it. But anyway, it's a very nice emoji. And there is a picture as well, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1880.96s)]
*  a really wonderful picture that she sent us with. You can see it there. Great grandsons, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1884.56s)]
*  Elliot, who's 10 and Joseph, who's 12. All of them, Americasters, even you Elliot at 10, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1889.92s)]
*  because although I said that 11 was actually the cut off, of course, I was joking. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1895.8400000000001s)]
*  Dorothy looks great. And I'm so glad that she's listening to us. Hello, Dorothy. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1901.2s)]
*  Yeah. And so that's it officially. Americast is from five days old, who we heard about last week [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1906.5600000000002s)]
*  to 98 years old and not that far off 99. Dorothy Rose, delighted to have you with us. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1912.0s)]
*  Yep. And we'll still be doing it when we are all 99, at various stages still to come, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1917.76s)]
*  because there is plenty to talk about. That's it for now. Bye. Bye, y'all. Bye. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1924.48s)]
*  Bye. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte9TDbaCUo&t=1947.76s)]
