Video Description: The US has signed a deal with Kyiv to share profits from the future sale of Ukraine's mineral and energy reserves, after months of tense negotiations.
The deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine's defence and reconstruction - as well as to address Washington's concerns over the amount of aid it has already contributed.
Ukraine is believed to have vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium and lithium. They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.

# US and Ukraine sign long-awaiting natural resources deal | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s)
*  The United States has signed a long-awaited deal with Ukraine securing access to the country's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=0.0s)]
*  natural resources. The agreement includes the creation of a shared investment fund to ensure [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=5.04s)]
*  Ukraine's economic recovery after the war with Russia. Well, it was signed by US Treasury Secretary [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=10.48s)]
*  Scott Besant and Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svihrydenko, who flew to Washington to sign [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=16.64s)]
*  the deal on Wednesday. Well, the deal gives the US access to the country's energy infrastructure, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=23.12s)]
*  oil and gas, as well as precious metals. Ukraine says the partnership will be equal on a 50-50 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=28.8s)]
*  basis. The resources will remain the property of Ukraine. In exchange, a joint investment fund [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=34.88s)]
*  will be set up to pay for future US military assistance and reconstruction efforts. Crucially, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=40.88s)]
*  unlike previous drafts, the fund will not be used to pay off Ukrainian debts for the billions of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=47.28s)]
*  dollars of US assistance already provided. Here's our North America correspondent, Jake Kwok. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=52.88s)]
*  It appears certain that no deal could ever come after this. President Zelensky left, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  leaving the minerals deal on the table. Then came this surprise meeting. Trump and Zelensky were [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=70.64s)]
*  meeting at the Pope's funeral last week. Just the two of them, 15 minutes, no interruption. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=76.4s)]
*  And today, Ukrainians have heard the warmest language Washington has spoken [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=82.16s)]
*  since President Trump came to power. Today's agreement signals clearly to Russian leadership [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=86.48s)]
*  that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=93.28s)]
*  and prosperous Ukraine over the long term. It's a fair deal, Ukraine says. Kyiv will put up the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=99.76s)]
*  money by selling licenses to develop its oil, gas, and minerals. And the US will put up either [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=106.48s)]
*  cash or any future weapons they send to Ukraine. The joint investment fund will pay for reconstruction [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=114.56s)]
*  and energy projects and pay dividends to investors. It's a much better deal than the one Mr. Trump [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  proposed earlier, which would have put Ukraine in debt for the weapons the US already provided. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  It's a moment of diplomatic victory for President Zelensky, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=132.0s)]
*  who wanted to tie Washington to his side by giving them a skin in the game. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=135.44s)]
*  It will take years before the deal can bear fruit, but its signal is immediate. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=139.52s)]
*  The US will not abandon Ukraine. The news is a blow for Moscow. An easy victory seems no longer [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=144.32s)]
*  likely. Washington is forcing Mr. Putin to rethink his calculation, and the peace deal may be closer. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  And for the people in this city, the deal cannot come fast enough. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=159.04s)]
*  Jay Kwon, BBC News. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, this deal comes as Russia has continued to carry out attacks in Ukraine, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  hitting more civilian targets. Officials in the city of Odessa say at least two people have [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=171.04s)]
*  been killed, five others wounded in an overnight drone strike. The regional governor said the attack [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  damaged residential buildings and a school. I think that fires had broken out in some areas. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Strategically important port city on the Black Sea has been repeatedly attacked since Russia's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=188.0s)]
*  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. An overnight drone attack is also being reported [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  in the eastern city of Kharkiv, where the authorities say a petrol station was hit there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=199.92s)]
*  Well, we can speak now to Hannah Shalest, who's in Odessa, also director of security programs [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  at the Foreign Policy Council Ukrainian Prism and editor-in-chief at Ukraine Analytica. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=211.76s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming on the programme. Thank you for the invitation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  So we're going to talk about the deal, but first of all, you are in Odessa, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=221.28s)]
*  just underlining there another difficult night. It was one of the worst nights, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  at least the last year. It was really terrifying. We are approximately one kilometre from [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=231.04s)]
*  one of the targets where Russians aimed their sheikhs. That area is quite residential. As we [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=237.28s)]
*  know, it is the school and the residential building that had been burned, another high scrapper in a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=244.48s)]
*  different district around 15 kilometres from us being targeted. And the sounds, I would say that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  living three years here in Odessa, that was one of the worst nights for me, because you heard [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=257.84s)]
*  both the very heavy explosions that even one kilometre from the epicentre of these, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=263.84s)]
*  my windows being trembling, really scary. But also when you hear the sounds of the sheikhs when [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=269.44s)]
*  they're getting lower, that's really a very terrifying sound. And we used to think that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=276.4s)]
*  we already acquainted to most of these fear that Russia is sending against the residential areas. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  Hannah, thank you for painting that picture for us. Let's turn now to the diplomacy and that deal [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=291.52s)]
*  that's been signed. What do you make of it? There are good and bad news. Luckily, there are more [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=297.28s)]
*  good news in it. And probably that was worth waiting these additional months to make this [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=304.4s)]
*  deal beneficial for both sides. I would say that it is a huge success of the Ukrainian negotiating [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=310.32s)]
*  team, because first of all, it is nothing about the debt that Ukraine never had against the US. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=315.52s)]
*  The second, that it is the equal partnership, 50-50 for Ukraine, both in terms of the earnings [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=321.76s)]
*  and in terms of the management. It is the international agreement, bilateral agreement, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  not some kind of fund created by the Deliver law. And it is not direct control only of the United [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  States. Plus, it is the clear formulations there that European integration of Ukraine [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=341.84s)]
*  should be the primer, so meaning that nothing inside of this deal can contradict the European [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  integration and our obligations under the European Union membership in the future. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=353.84s)]
*  And also that the money will go first and foremost for the reinvesting in Ukraine and in [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=358.64s)]
*  rebuilding of Ukraine. The agreement, the draft that we saw just one month ago was absolutely [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  different. It was total control of the US and it was the possibility to invest anywhere [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=370.96s)]
*  rather than in Ukraine. Why I said that there are bad news as well, because there is nothing [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=376.56s)]
*  about security guarantees as Ukraine really wanted originally. But we understand that the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=381.52s)]
*  current US administration considers investments the best security guarantees. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=387.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And what do you make of that? Because that has been the argument that just having the US [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=392.0s)]
*  involved in that way in itself provides a security guarantee. Do you buy that? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=396.72s)]
*  Let me be skeptical about this because I know what targets Russia aimed at the very first months of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=403.68s)]
*  the war. There were a lot of the US investments there, including Coca-Cola manufacturing, for [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=408.8s)]
*  example, and others. So knowing Russians, I understand that these type of guarantees is not [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=414.0s)]
*  the guarantee for them. They understand only military involvement. So there is one article [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  in this agreement, at least how we know it from the Vice Prime Minister, that US can contribute [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=426.4s)]
*  by weapons, not only by money in this fund. So if this would be the real contribution, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=432.4s)]
*  that definitely would amplify the security component of this agreement. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=438.4s)]
*  Hannah Schless, thank you so much for coming on the programme. Thank you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  Let's cross straight to Keefe now. Our correspondent, John Donison, is there. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  Hi, John. So we heard one assessment there of the deal. How is it being received there in Keefe? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=452.48s)]
*  Well, I think your guest there gave a pretty graphic picture of the fact that this is a [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  business deal. It's an economic deal. It's not a peace deal. And the fighting is ongoing. I mean, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  we had airstrikes just in the background last night, literally as this deal was being signed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=473.76s)]
*  just outside Keefe, loud explosions, anti-aircraft fire going up. But I think, look, the Ukrainians [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=480.08s)]
*  feel they've got a better deal than they were hoping for, certainly a better deal that was on [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=486.96s)]
*  the table when we had that slanging match in the Oval Office between President Zelensky and President [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=491.76s)]
*  Trump back in February. And I think the reason why it's better now is that back then President [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=497.36s)]
*  Trump was talking about this being a deal that would allow Ukraine to pay back the billions of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=504.4s)]
*  dollars of money that had been used for U.S. military assistance over the past three years. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, under this deal, that won't happen. The money that will be generated, that will be put [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=516.4s)]
*  into this investment fund could be used for future military assistance, future humanitarian [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=521.28s)]
*  assistance, and also reconstruction in Ukraine. But they won't have to repay that debt. So, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=527.36s)]
*  you know, as your guest was saying there, there are no explicit security guarantees in this deal [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  for Ukraine. But I think implicitly, you know, if America has a bigger stake, a bigger financial [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=541.2s)]
*  stake in this country, then they're going to want to protect those interests. And we're talking about [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=547.84s)]
*  a deal that is not short term. It's a decades long deal. So I think they've much more reason to feel [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=553.28s)]
*  satisfied here in Kiev than perhaps they do in the Kremlin this morning. Well, John, you said [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=559.84s)]
*  they're a long term deal. Let's come to the short term then. Where does this fit in when we think of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=565.52s)]
*  things like ceasefires and peace agreements? Well, we're going to have to wait and see. You know, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  President Trump has been pushing very hard for some sort of ceasefire peace deal with the Russians. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=578.72s)]
*  He has pledged to end this war. He said he could do it in a day. He didn't do it in 100 days. It's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  proved more challenging than he thought. But certainly the change in tone, the change in [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=590.0s)]
*  language from the White House just in the past week. You know, when you think back to February [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=596.0s)]
*  and that meeting in the Oval Office where he was accusing President Zelensky of basically wanting [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=601.36s)]
*  to start World War Three, he was saying that it was a conflict that Ukraine had [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=605.6s)]
*  bore some responsibility for starting. Well, now, you know, we had the Treasury Secretary in the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  U.S. yesterday saying that this was a clear signal to Russia that this cruel and senseless war must [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=619.28s)]
*  stop and a clear signal that the U.S. had a long term interest in a sovereign Ukraine. So I think [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=625.6s)]
*  things have shifted in the last week or so. Whether America can now put pressure on the Russians [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=634.88s)]
*  to give concessions that could get us to the negotiating table because what the Ukrainians [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=642.24s)]
*  want, they've been consistent in this, and the Americans wanted it to, is a 30-day unconditional [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=647.52s)]
*  ceasefire before we even get into talks about territory, about Ukraine's long-term security. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=653.2s)]
*  Now, so far the Russians have rejected that. They've offered this three-day ceasefire starting [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=658.88s)]
*  next week, but, you know, the Ukrainians say we want more than that before we get to talks. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=664.48s)]
*  John, thank you. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ-JLhqw5s&t=672.5600000000001s)]
