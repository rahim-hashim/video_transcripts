Video Description: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his explosive Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump on Friday was "regrettable", in his first public remarks since the US announced a pause in military aid to Kyiv.
 
Zelensky said "nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians" after Trump accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. He also expressed a willingness to consider a partial truce, if Moscow did likewise.
 
US Vice-President JD Vance said in response that the US needs to "get some payback for the incredible financial investment" it has made in Ukraine, and the “lack of private engagement is what is most concerning to us".

# Ukrainian President Zelensky ‘wants to make things right’ with US President Trump | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA)
*  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says it's time to make things right with President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump after their clash at the White House on Friday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=5.72s)]
*  He said he would work under what he called the President's strong leadership to bring [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=9.16s)]
*  lasting peace, hours after Donald Trump suddenly announced that he was pausing all military [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=12.6s)]
*  aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=17.8s)]
*  The US is by far the biggest single source of military aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  Here, the UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, welcomed President Zelensky's steadfast commitment [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=23.68s)]
*  to securing peace. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=29.2s)]
*  Here's our international editor, Jeremy Bowen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  A Russian drone penetrated air defences in Sumi in northeastern Ukraine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Without American missiles, this will happen more. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=40.76s)]
*  Stopping weapons shipments for Trump is a gambit designed to force Ukraine to accept [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=44.28s)]
*  his view of peace, which is looking more like Russia's than Ukraine's. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=49.16s)]
*  Even so, Ukraine's European allies have pressed President Zelensky to offer Trump an olive [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=54.36s)]
*  branch, and he's obliged. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=59.92s)]
*  On X, a promise to work for a limited truce under what he called President Trump's strong [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=63.24s)]
*  leadership. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=69.28s)]
*  We really do value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=70.28s)]
*  independence. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  The shouting match at the White House, he says, was regrettable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=77.56s)]
*  It is time to make things right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=80.48s)]
*  In Washington, Vice President J.D. Vance, who once said, I don't care much about what [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=84.84s)]
*  happens to Ukraine, said they needed more from President Zelensky. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=89.34s)]
*  The public stuff doesn't matter nearly as much as what are the Ukrainians doing to meaningfully [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=94.34s)]
*  engage on what a peaceful settlement would look like. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=100.22s)]
*  We need the Ukrainians privately to come to us and say, this is what we need, this is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=103.22s)]
*  what we want, this is how we're going to participate in the process to end this conflict. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  That's the most important thing, and that lack of private engagement is what is most [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  concerning to us. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=116.14s)]
*  In London on Sunday, Keir Starmer and other European leaders agreed to find a way to offer [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  President Zelensky a route to peace with security guarantees from Europe and the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=122.38s)]
*  Britain's prime minister is trying to satisfy Donald Trump without betraying Ukraine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=128.9s)]
*  He says it's not an either-or. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=133.98s)]
*  It might be. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=137.3s)]
*  Europe and the U.S. are now on opposite sides of the argument. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=138.82s)]
*  The armed suspension will delight President Putin. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=142.82s)]
*  This was the Ukrainian territory Russia controlled just before the full-scale invasion three [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=146.45999999999998s)]
*  years ago, and this is what it has now, about 20% of the country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  President Trump has already said that President Putin can keep at least some of it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=158.54s)]
*  Now, President Trump's peace proposal includes U.S. access to valuable deposits of rare earths [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  and strategic minerals. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=172.66s)]
*  He's refused Ukraine's request for the U.S. military to guarantee its security in return. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=174.3s)]
*  It seems clear that President Trump's priority is restoring U.S. relations with Russia and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  not Ukrainian or indeed European security. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=187.62s)]
*  It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=191.06s)]
*  The shouting match in the Oval Office last Friday ripped away any pretence that it will [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=194.26000000000002s)]
*  be easy to bridge the gap between peace and war. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=198.82s)]
*  Donald Trump's attempt to force President Zelensky to do it his way has plunged America [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=203.06s)]
*  and its NATO allies into their worst crisis since the alliance was formed just after the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=209.18s)]
*  Second World War. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=214.66s)]
*  Jeremy Bowen, BBC News. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=216.62s)]
*  Our North America editor, Sarah Smith, explained how quickly U.S. aid could be turned back [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=219.29999999999998s)]
*  on if they're receptive to President Zelensky's comments. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's a very interesting question. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  Very quickly, presumably, because they just paused everything where it was. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=231.18s)]
*  Any munitions or anything that was on its way to Ukraine just stopped, even things that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=235.38s)]
*  had already made it to Poland. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  So they could turn that back on very quickly. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  But we haven't heard yet from the White House what they make of this statement from President [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=243.9s)]
*  Zelensky, and it will all hinge on what Donald Trump himself thinks. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=247.7s)]
*  Does he feel that this is an apology that he can accept or does he want to see Mr. Zelensky [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=252.26s)]
*  eat more humble pie in public before he's prepared to give him a seat at the negotiating [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  table again? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=261.86s)]
*  We have heard from the Vice President, JD Vance, who has told reporters that it's actually [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  more important what happens in private conversations and whether in those conversations President [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=267.22s)]
*  Zelensky can convince the administration that he is ready to seriously talk about peace, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=272.3s)]
*  to tell the White House what he wants, what he needs, and demonstrate his commitment to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=278.26s)]
*  this process before they start talking to him again. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  In his favour, Donald Trump is very keen to get on with this quite quickly. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=285.98s)]
*  He wants to sign that economic deal that gives the US access to critical mineral deposits [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=290.38s)]
*  in Ukraine as fast as possible. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=294.92s)]
*  And he has said himself he thinks that peace in Ukraine can be achieved either very soon [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=297.26s)]
*  or not at all. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=302.18s)]
*  So he is anxious to get on with this process and therefore it may be possible that it starts [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=303.42s)]
*  up again pretty quickly. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=308.21999999999997s)]
*  Briefly if you would, Sarah, a lot of people still trying to understand why Donald Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=309.86s)]
*  is taking this approach with Ukraine when he doesn't seem to be taking a similar approach [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=313.5s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=318.61999999999995s)]
*  We saw, for example, in the last 24 hours or so the US removing those cyber security [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=319.61999999999995s)]
*  offensive policies against Russia when lots of experts are saying, look, this leaves the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=326.38s)]
*  US open to potential hacks from Russia. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  Yes, and there are even reports that the White House is drawing up plans to alleviate sanctions [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=334.94s)]
*  on Russia as well as something else that would be favoured by Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=341.5s)]
*  And this is what people are asking, are we actually watching America changing sides in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=345.54s)]
*  this conflict and backing Russia against Ukraine or is this simply Donald Trump's admiration [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=350.3s)]
*  for a strongman leader in Vladimir Putin who he thinks holds more cards in these negotiations [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=356.06s)]
*  and that he's trying to make Vladimir Zelensky understand the position that he's in, the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  poor negotiating position that Donald Trump thinks he has, although of course that is [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=365.98s)]
*  further hurt by the withdrawal of American military aid. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=370.94s)]
*  So yet policy seems to be being made day by day here in the White House and many of us [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=374.18s)]
*  are trying to work out what the long-term implications would be. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=380.62s)]
*  Sarah Smith, our North America editor. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxSUr0kvrXA&t=383.46s)]
