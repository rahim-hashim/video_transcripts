Video Description: Electricity is being restored across Spain and Portugal, one day after a massive power cut.
 
The operator of Spain’s national grid says power has now been restored to 90% of the country’s mainland, but the effects of the blackout are likely to be felt for days. 
 
The power outage left millions of people in the two countries - and some parts of France - without electricity on Monday, leading to chaotic scenes and widespread disruption.

# Power returning to Spain and Portugal after blackout | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k)
*  Now to Europe, electricity is being restored across Spain and Portugal the day after a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=0.0s)]
*  massive power cut. It caused disruption to millions of shops, homes and businesses and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=4.8s)]
*  paralysed transport networks in both countries. The operator of Spain's national grid says [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=10.0s)]
*  that power has now been restored to 90% of the country's mainland, but the effects of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=15.24s)]
*  the blackout are likely to be felt for days. Well, our correspondent in Spain and Portugal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=20.52s)]
*  gave us the latest from the ground. Here's Guy Hedgego in Madrid. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=25.64s)]
*  Well, certainly in central Madrid, it feels as if things are pretty much back to normal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=30.68s)]
*  Traffic is flowing again after those problems with traffic lights yesterday. However, there [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=34.92s)]
*  are some exceptions. Schools are not open as normal today in many areas of the country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=41.56s)]
*  And another big exception is rail travel. There's still quite severe disruption in many areas of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=48.44s)]
*  the country, particularly up in the region of Catalonia and some other areas. And many [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=54.36s)]
*  rail passengers did spend the night out in stations last night. So things are still returning to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=59.96s)]
*  normal. There's a feeling that we're not quite back to 100%. But the authorities are telling [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=68.28s)]
*  us that in the coming hours, they're hoping that we will be back up to 100% of energy supply and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=73.64s)]
*  we'll be back to relatively speaking back to normal. Guy there in Madrid. Alison, you're in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=81.08s)]
*  Lisbon. We understand that, as Guy was saying, schools not reopening fully across Spain, but the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=87.16s)]
*  situation is slightly different in Portugal. What's this scenario there like? Well, right now I'm [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=93.24s)]
*  actually in the north of Portugal. The lights came on a little bit earlier than in Lisbon last night. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=99.72s)]
*  But now there are perhaps a couple of hundred thousand people only without power. The government [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=105.0s)]
*  says that they do hope that that will all be resolved in the coming hours. And as you can see [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=110.6s)]
*  behind me, traffic is certainly flowing. Things are pretty much back to normal. We had some difficulty [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  with the Lisbon metro system, for example, this morning. It opened rather later than usual. Most [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=120.6s)]
*  schools should actually be open and functioning today. Certainly the government said that it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=126.36s)]
*  expected that. So the expectation is that things will be pretty much back to normal today throughout [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=130.04s)]
*  the day. OK, and the overwhelming question, Guy, is why? What was behind this huge power outage? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=135.08s)]
*  I know that Spain's increasing reliance on solar and wind was said to have exacerbated the power [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  cuts. What kind of commentary has there been there in Spain? Well, yes, I mean, that's one of the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=147.96s)]
*  things that people are talking about at the moment. And I think, you know, you understand that there's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  going to be a lot of focus on how Spain generates its electricity, where it comes from. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=158.92s)]
*  We do know that Spain and Portugal were cut off from the main European grid yesterday, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=165.72s)]
*  but we don't know why this happened. Inevitably, I think there's a lot of talk about cyber attacks, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  possibly. But the government's been quite adamant that we shouldn't jump to conclusions. It's saying [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  that it's not ruling out any possibilities. There was one senior politician in the south of the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=182.76s)]
*  country, Juan Mamoreno, yesterday, who seemed to be pointing the finger very firmly at a cyber attack. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=187.72s)]
*  But the government has insisted that we don't know that at the moment. That's just one hypothesis. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=193.48s)]
*  And it's saying we have to be patient and wait for more information before we know exactly what [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=201.88s)]
*  happened. Yeah. And, Alison, Portugal's leader, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro, was very quick [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=206.36s)]
*  yesterday to say that this wasn't a cyber attack. Well, he said certainly there's nothing that could [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=211.72s)]
*  point to that. Obviously, there were people who came out and said this looks as though it's a cyber [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=218.84s)]
*  attack. But certainly the government said there's no evidence pointing to that at all. But from the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=223.4s)]
*  point of view of Portugal, obviously, they are looking to Spain now to see if they can work out [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=227.88s)]
*  what the causes are. When Portugal came back up again, it was very much a local affair with two [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=232.04s)]
*  major power stations getting the system back and running with no help from Spain. So they're back [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=237.48s)]
*  to the old days when the two systems were running separately because normally they are very much [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  interconnected. And that's why Portugal was affected with this power outage. And, Guy, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=248.12s)]
*  you've talked about the disruption on across the nail, red works across the Madrid metro, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=254.6s)]
*  but tennis also being impacted. The Madrid Open, it was the game, games were cancelled yesterday. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=259.56s)]
*  What's the situation like today? Do we know? Well, that's right. It was. And this is a major [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=267.64s)]
*  sporting event, not just for Madrid, but for Spain. The latest I'm told is that I believe that play is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=275.4s)]
*  expected to resume today. But we're waiting for the details about that. But, you know, I think [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=283.32s)]
*  this it shows how far this outage reached, not just into things like transport and traffic and so on, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=290.68s)]
*  but into many other areas of life and how it even affected sport yesterday. Yeah, indeed. And, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=297.96s)]
*  Alison, just a final word from you then, just as slowly those power supplies are re-energized and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=304.2s)]
*  people are getting back to normal. I wonder, was there a sense of exasperation across the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=313.16s)]
*  public in Portugal or was it down to business as usual, albeit without essential mobile phones? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=318.04s)]
*  Well, there was some degree of panic yesterday. A lot of people rushing to what shops were open [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=325.0s)]
*  to buy essentials. A lot of people buying water, toilet paper. This is something we saw in lockdown [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  during the pandemic. Perhaps a little bit of concern that the government didn't come out a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  little earlier and make clear that it was on the case as it were. But in fact, for much of the day [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=340.12s)]
*  yesterday, it wasn't just the internet. In fact, it wasn't possible to even make mobile phone calls. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=345.8s)]
*  It was only people who had car radios or battery-powered radios that actually [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=349.88s)]
*  could work out what was going on. Thanks to Alison Roberts there and Lisbon and Guy Hedgeco in Madrid. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfOcK14e_k&t=353.88s)]
