# Israeli military says eight hostages released in Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E)
*  Nikki, I'm just going to interrupt you because we're seeing, being quoted on Reuters now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=0.0s)]
*  the Israeli military saying that seven hostages, including two Israelis and five foreign nationals, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=6.4s)]
*  have been transferred to the Red Cross. So that would explain what we were seeing in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Hanunis, those scenes in Hanunis, the vehicles from the convoy reversing and stopping to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=17.52s)]
*  pick up more people. Originally we had Arbel Yohud and Gaddy Moses, two of the three Israeli [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=25.68s)]
*  hostages due to be released today, being brought to that convoy of vehicles. But there were [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=32.6s)]
*  four vehicles. Then they moved, the vehicles in that convoy, they came to a stop and then [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=38.44s)]
*  two of them in turn reversed back into the crowd. And it was clear that somebody was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=43.84s)]
*  being brought towards them. So now confirmation from the Israeli military, according to the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  Reuters news agency, that those five foreign nationals, they say, we assume to be the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=53.92s)]
*  Thai hostages, have also been handed to the Red Cross. Now, all five were working on farms [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=59.6s)]
*  in southern Israel when they were kidnapped during the October 7 attacks. In total, eight [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=67.56s)]
*  Thai citizens were abducted. Yes, Anita... The foreign ministry believes two of them are [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  dead. Five released today, one still unaccounted for. Yes, Anita, I can just read you that statement [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=79.6s)]
*  that has come from the IDF. They are saying, according to information communicated by the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  Red Cross, seven hostages, including two Israelis and five foreign nationals, were transferred [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=90.96s)]
*  to them and are now on their way towards IDF and ISA forces in Gaza. So as you say, the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  information coming from the IDF, this information that has been given to them by the Red Cross, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=106.0s)]
*  that those seven hostages are now being transferred on their way to the IDF and ISA forces in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=112.32s)]
*  Gaza. So again, that is towards this border location where they get handed over and then [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=120.24s)]
*  they get taken to the Israeli base, which is on the border of Gaza, and that's where [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  they will normally, as we've seen this morning, meet their parents, relations and friends [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=132.32s)]
*  and have that initial medical check-up before, as you can see on the pictures that you can [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=138.76s)]
*  see on screen, the helicopter will then take them to one of the hospitals in central Israel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  There are a number of them that are prepared to take hostages and we know that the military [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=150.56s)]
*  observer, the 20-year-old who was released this morning, has been now taken to that medical [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=157.28s)]
*  centre. You saw that the barriers were put up, those temporary barriers, so that the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=164.6s)]
*  media couldn't film her being taken off that helicopter because she will now be taken for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=170.4s)]
*  more comprehensive medical check-ups than were first done at the border. But we have [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=176.84s)]
*  seen pictures of her with her parents being reunited that the IDF have shared. So she's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=182.32s)]
*  now in that medical centre in central Israel. And the other hostages that we have had confirmed, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  so that's the two Israeli hostages, Abel Yehud, the 29-year-old, and also the first male hostage [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=197.48s)]
*  to be released under this current ceasefire deal, Gaddy Moses, the 80-year-old, now being [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=206.24s)]
*  transferred by the Red Cross towards the border of Gaza and Israel, where they will be handed [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  over to the IDF forces and they're also confirming that there are five foreign nationals. As [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=218.68s)]
*  you mentioned, Anita, they didn't say if they were Thai nationals in that statement from [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=225.12s)]
*  of course, we were expecting five Thai nationals to be released. The Thai government is saying [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=231.8s)]
*  that six of its citizens have still been held in Gaza, and as we said, we expected five [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  of them to be released today. The IDF confirming that there are five foreign nationals, as [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=245.96s)]
*  they described them. Now, according to the Red Cross, with the Red Cross heading towards [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  the Gaza border, but as we say at the moment, Anita, the IDF not confirming that they are [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=257.32s)]
*  those Thai nationals. OK, Nicky, I'm just going to bring in a couple more images for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=263.36s)]
*  our viewers. We have an image here of Abel Yehud, of her release, or we had a photograph [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=269.68s)]
*  earlier. Now we have these moving images of her release, flanked by Hamas and Islamic [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=278.68s)]
*  Jihad fighters being brought to those Red Cross vehicles. It was very, very, very difficult [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=286.88s)]
*  to make out what was happening in the huge crowds and the crush earlier, but we could [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=294.2s)]
*  tell that someone was in the centre of this crowd of people, and there we have the images [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=299.36s)]
*  of Abel Yehud looking perhaps somewhat alarmed and distressed by the crush around her. And [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=306.0s)]
*  then a Gamburger, that is the 20-year-old soldier. Oh, yeah, let's actually just hold [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=313.56s)]
*  on these pictures for a moment, and we'll run them, as many of them as we have. So the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=319.48s)]
*  fighters around her trying to keep back the crowds who are surging forward, anxious for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=330.04s)]
*  a glimpse of Abel Yehud, the 29-year-old hostage. And then a Gamburger earlier today released [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=335.56s)]
*  the 20-year-old soldier. She was only on her second day of duty at that surveillance post [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=343.16s)]
*  when she was taken on the 7th of October. She's been greeted there by the Israeli authorities. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=349.24s)]
*  This is the moment at which, of course, she is handed over by the Red Cross to the Israeli [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=359.44s)]
*  authorities. She brings her hands to her mouth, almost perhaps in disbelief that this [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=365.04s)]
*  moment has come. And then she was swiftly brought to a reception point where she was [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=373.0s)]
*  reunited with her family. And then, as we saw a short while ago, she was brought by [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=380.66s)]
*  helicopter to a place where she will be taken to a medical facility for all the soldiers [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=386.56s)]
*  sort of checks, the physical and psychological checks that will be made on her. And those [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=395.04s)]
*  screens were put up to afford her some privacy as she and her family got off the helicopter. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=402.24s)]
*  Obviously, so many people wanting to see her, wanting to get a glimpse of her face, but [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=408.24s)]
*  that privacy afforded to her. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUiQGSsmb3E&t=412.88s)]
