Video Description: At least 70 people are known to have died in the flash floods that have swept through parts of central Texas.
Hundreds of rescuers have been deployed to search for people who are missing.  The worst affected area is Kerr County where a Christian youth camp located along the River Guadalupe was swept away by theflooding.
"The work continues, and will continue, until everyone is found," promised Larry Leitha, the sheriff of Kerr County.
People have also been confirmed dead in other parts of the state, including Travis County and Tom Green County.
Multiple flash flood warnings remain in place. Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed an expanded disaster declaration to step up search efforts.  He said officials would be relentless in ensuring they locate "every single person who's been a victim of this event", adding that "we will stop when the job is completed".
In a post on social media, President Trump said: “These families are enduring an unimaginable tragedy.”

**BBC - World News:** [July 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI)
*  The number of dead following devastating flash floods in Texas has now risen to at least 70, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=0.0s)]
*  including 21 children. A number of other people are missing, including 11 girls who were [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  attending a summer camp on the banks of a river. The state's governor, Greg Abbott, says there's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  a need for speed as hundreds of rescuers search for survivors. Well, the Guadalupe River burst [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=16.32s)]
*  its banks during heavy rains in an area northwest of San Antonio, close to Camp Mystic, a Christian [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=22.64s)]
*  summer retreat for girls. And there are fears of more flooding as rain continues to fall. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=29.36s)]
*  Gary O'Donoghue has our top story from Texas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=34.8s)]
*  Now into the third day of this rescue effort and the death toll continues to rise inexorably. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=41.44s)]
*  Emergency services and volunteers have been out by the camps ever since the floodwater hit, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  walking the trails looking for the missing girls. We're helping the parents of two of the missing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=54.24s)]
*  children and their house collapsed about four in the morning and they were being washed away and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=62.0s)]
*  on her cell phone the last message they got was we're being washed away and the phone went dead. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  So I'm just across the river now from Camp Mystic and you can see where the recreation hall [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=76.4s)]
*  had its whole front wall torn away. There are still some rescue workers over there sifting [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=80.96s)]
*  through the debris because there are still some of the girls missing but as time passes now well [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=86.72s)]
*  beyond 48 hours after the flooding, hope of finding anyone alive is significantly diminishing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=92.08s)]
*  Debris still scatters the huts at Camp Mystic where the girls were staying for the Independence [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=100.16s)]
*  Day holiday weekend. There are parents who still do not know where their children are like Michael. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=105.68s)]
*  We got here and started looking and the game warden showed up or we went as far as we could downstream [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=113.12s)]
*  but we don't have the equipment for that so we're letting them do that and then we're looking for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=124.64000000000001s)]
*  places that they're going to potentially be alive. More than 800 people have already been [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=130.72s)]
*  rescued in the past days though many did not make it. They included Jane Ragsdale described as the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=136.48s)]
*  heart and soul of the camp where she was the director. Julian Ryan whose final words to his [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=143.68s)]
*  fiance were I'm sorry I'm not going to make it I love you all and eight-year-old Renee whose family [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=149.68s)]
*  said she was having the time of her life at Camp Mystic. Mystic's co-owner Dick Eastland from a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=157.92s)]
*  family that spent generations running the camp is also among the dead. Conditions continue to be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  challenging for the rescue teams with more warnings about further rain and potential flooding. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=172.72s)]
*  Local officials say they're doing everything they can. We want to make sure that we continue to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=178.72s)]
*  focus we still have 11 missing children that we want to get reunited with our families [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  until we can get reunited with our families. We are not going to stop until we do so thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=187.36s)]
*  This tragedy is far from over and while this devastated community continues to come to terms [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=197.28s)]
*  with its loss it's also starting to ask questions about how it could have been caught so off guard [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  by this torrential flood. Yeah Gary you mentioned challenging conditions for those trying to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=209.52s)]
*  find survivors what are the hopes of pulling out anyone else alive? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=216.64s)]
*  Well this is the the hopes are pretty low to be honest Clive this amount of time on from the the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=224.48s)]
*  flood and of course conditions are worsening in fact we were down by the river talking to people [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  about an hour and a half ago and suddenly there were a lot of police cordons a lot of people with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=235.04s)]
*  megaphone shouting that there was a 10 feet wall of water coming down the river evacuating [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  everyone up to to higher ground where we are now. Now it seems that that wall of water may be [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  hitting somewhere else a creek a little bit further down not that part of the river where [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  the camps were but you can see that these flash floods are still a big problem we're getting [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=256.64s)]
*  constant alerts on our phones emergency alerts about the potential for flooding so immensely [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  challenging environment and still as well as the children the 10 children the one camp supervisor [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=266.88s)]
*  missing there's hundreds possibly thousands of other people that would have been holidaying in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=272.56s)]
*  this area the authorities have no idea how many of those are safe or not. And questions tonight Gary [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=276.96s)]
*  about flood preparedness in the area. Yeah and in particular about the warning systems and the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=284.8s)]
*  forecasting there were emergency alerts sent by the National Weather Service in the early hours [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=293.44s)]
*  of Friday morning for these floods but no one really forecast the size of the water surge [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=300.16s)]
*  there would be. Now there have been cuts to the National Weather Service and the National [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=306.16s)]
*  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cuts introduced by Elon Musk's Doge department at [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=311.68s)]
*  the beginning of this administration but big pushback from the administration on this saying [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=318.0s)]
*  that's not what it is that they say the equipment needs upgrading. This is an area that is it is [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  prone to flash flooding but no one predicted this and there will be significant questions about [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=328.0s)]
*  you know why no one in these camps appeared to get the word soon enough [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=334.32s)]
*  to evacuate given that they were right by the river. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRTL7tkOTI&t=338.48s)]
