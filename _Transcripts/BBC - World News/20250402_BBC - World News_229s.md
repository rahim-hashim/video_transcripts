Video Description: Myanmar's military opened fire at a Chinese Red Cross convoy carrying earthquake relief supplies on Tuesday night.
 
The Ta'ang National Liberation Army, an armed rebel group, said that military troops shot at the convoy of nine vehicles with machine guns in eastern Shan State.
 
Myanmar's junta, which said it was investigating the incident, denied shooting directly at the vehicles and said troops fired shots into the air after the convoy did not stop, despite it being signalled to do so.
 
Myanmar has been gripped by violence amid a civil war between the junta, which seized power in a 2021 coup and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country.
 
Rebel groups have unilaterally announced a ceasefire to support earthquake relief efforts, but the military has refused to do the same.

# Myanmar military fires at Chinese Red Cross convoy carrying earthquake relief supplies | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk)
*  The army in Myanmar has admitted firing on a convoy from China that was on its way to provide earthquake relief. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=0.0s)]
*  The military continues attacks on rebel groups despite the earthquake. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  The junta now saying more than 2,886 people are known to have died. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  But the true number of casualties is feared to be much higher. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=17.64s)]
*  More than four and a half thousand people have also been injured in this 7.7 magnitude earthquake, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=20.84s)]
*  which was also felt in neighboring countries like Thailand. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=25.52s)]
*  Let's just show you those pictures again that we're getting from Bangkok as it is early evening there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=29.4s)]
*  And you can still see the cranes very much in operation trying to move the rubble from the skyscraper that collapsed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=35.12s)]
*  But the Bangkok governor, who is has been holding news conferences most days, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=40.72s)]
*  saying it's unlikely that anyone will be found alive. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=46.56s)]
*  And there for us over these past few days has been our reporter Nick Marsh, who joins us from Bangkok. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=50.68s)]
*  Firstly, Nick, let's talk about what's happening in Myanmar and the latest on what the junta is saying about the rebels saying that they will have a ceasefire. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=56.72s)]
*  And yet the army continues to drop bombs and fire on those groups in areas that are devastated by the quake. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=67.88s)]
*  What are we hearing? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=76.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right, Lucy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=79.32s)]
*  Just to remind viewers, Myanmar is not completely under the control of the military junta. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=81.56s)]
*  It's estimated that as much as three quarters of the country could be under rebel control, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=88.36s)]
*  because basically for decades now, this military regime has been fighting this sort of patchwork of different various armed ethnic militias. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=97.08s)]
*  Today, some of those leading rebel groups said we are going to ceasefire for the time being. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=106.4s)]
*  We need to get as much humanitarian support in to our areas as possible. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=112.32s)]
*  And continuing with this armed campaign is just not going to help people here at all. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=117.08s)]
*  The military junta heard that and they rejected that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=121.56s)]
*  Their rationale is that because these armed groups are still training militants, because they're still planning attacks for the future, they consider that attack in and of itself. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=124.8s)]
*  So as you say, the bombing has continued, the ground offensives have continued, and you have this situation now where millions of people are not only having to deal with the devastation of this earthquake and the loss of life and the poor sanitation and everything that comes with it, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  they're also having to deal with the regular bombings and armed campaigns of the military junta. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=149.32s)]
*  And we even saw a situation, like you said, this morning, where a convoy of Chinese Red Cross workers were fired on. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=155.2s)]
*  The junta says that there were warning shots, that they didn't stop in a conflict zone when they were told to. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=162.6s)]
*  But it kind of just shows you the absurdity of the situation, how remarkable this entire situation is in Myanmar right now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=168.28s)]
*  And Nick, do we know how much aid is getting in? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=174.8s)]
*  Because there have been concerns from some aid agencies that the junta would weaponise aid. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=177.56s)]
*  So the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Myanmar spoke to the BBC yesterday, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=182.28s)]
*  and he said that there had been reports of aid being stopped at checkpoints entering rebel-held areas. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  This is a big concern for international observers, that aid is coming in, but it's only being concentrated in government-held areas. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=200.0s)]
*  In terms of the rescue effort, we do know there are foreign teams on the ground from places like China and Russia. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  The United States has belatedly sent a very small team of what we think is just three people, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=215.76s)]
*  and a lot of people have criticised that response as being too little and too late. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  Nick, thanks so much for joining us. Nick March, they're live for us in Bangkok. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsN42J8GoQk&t=225.56s)]
