Video Description: Theresa May says concerns have been expressed about leaving the EU without a deal, with calls for it to be ruled out.
She says the best way to rule out a no deal Brexit is to agree a deal with the EU. The only other way is to extend Article 50, something she says the EU is unlikely to agree to without a clear plan of how an agreement can be reached.
When people say the government should rule out no deal, she says they are essentially saying "we should revoke Article 50".
This doesn't respect the Brexit vote, she says.
Others are calling for a second referendum, she says, but "our duty is to implement the first one". She is concerned about the precedent that would set for future refendums.
She says she does not know what Jeremy Corbyn believes regarding this, as he has "not engaged".

# UK PM Theresa May's Brexit statement- BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 21, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4)
*  I am sure that the whole House will join me in condemning Saturday's car bomb attack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=0.0s)]
*  in Londonderry and paying tribute to the bravery of the Northern Ireland police and the local [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=11.28s)]
*  community who helped to ensure that everyone got to safety. This House stands together [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=18.1s)]
*  with the people of Northern Ireland in ensuring that we never go back to the violence and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=23.42s)]
*  terror of the past. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=27.8s)]
*  Turning to Brexit, following last week's vote it is clear that the Government's approach [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  had to change, and it has. Having established the confidence of Parliament in this Government, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=34.76s)]
*  I have listened to colleagues across Parliament from different parties and with different [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=41.68s)]
*  views. Last week I met the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the Westminster leaders of the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=45.8s)]
*  DUP, SNP, Clyde Cymru and the Green Party, and backbench Members from both sides of this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  House. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also had a number [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=57.6s)]
*  of such meetings. The Government have approached these meetings in a constructive spirit without [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  preconditions, and I am pleased that everyone we met with took the same approach. I regret [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=67.16s)]
*  that the right hon. Gentleman, the Leader of the Opposition, has not chosen to take [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  part so far. I hope he will reflect on that decision. Given the importance of this issue, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=83.6s)]
*  we should all be prepared to work together to find a way forward, and my ministerial [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  colleagues and I will continue with further meetings this week. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  Let me set out the six key issues which have been at the centre of the talks to date. The [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=100.08s)]
*  first two relate to the process for moving forwards. First, there is widespread concern [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  of the UK leaving without a deal. There are those on both sides of the House who want [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=110.72s)]
*  the Government to rule this out. We need to be honest with the British people about what [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  that means. The right way to rule out no deal is for this House to approve a deal with the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  European Union. That is what this Government are seeking to achieve. The only other guaranteed [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=128.2s)]
*  way to avoid a no deal Brexit is to revoke article 50, which would mean staying in the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=137.4s)]
*  EU. There are others who think that what we need is more time, so they say we should extend [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=142.4s)]
*  article 50 to give longer for Parliament to debate how we should leave and what a deal [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  should look like. This is not ruling out no deal but simply deferring the point of decision, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  and the EU are very unlikely simply to agree to extend article 50 without a plan for how [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=158.28s)]
*  we are going to approve a deal. When people say rule out no deal, the consequences of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=163.56s)]
*  what they are actually saying are that if we in Parliament cannot approve a deal, we [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=170.36s)]
*  should revoke article 50. I believe this would go against the referendum result, and I do [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=175.16s)]
*  not believe that is a course of action that we should take or which this House should [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=183.7s)]
*  Second, all the opposition parties that have engaged so far, and some backbenchers, have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=189.12s)]
*  expressed their support for a second referendum. I have set out many times my deep concerns [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=194.96s)]
*  about returning to the British people for a second referendum. Our duty is to implement [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=200.28s)]
*  the decision of the first one. I fear a second referendum would set a difficult precedent [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=204.88s)]
*  that could have significant implications for how we handle referendums in this country, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=211.24s)]
*  not least strengthening the hand of those campaigning to break up our United Kingdom. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=216.84s)]
*  It would require an extension of article 50. We would very likely have to return a new [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=226.36s)]
*  set of MEPs to the European Parliament in May. I also believe that there has not yet [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  been enough recognition of the way that a second referendum could damage social cohesion [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=240.88s)]
*  by undermining faith in our democracy. We do not know what the right hon. Gentleman, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=246.44s)]
*  the Leader of the Opposition, thinks about this, because he has not engaged, but I know [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=256.08s)]
*  that there are Members who have already indicated that they wish to test the support of the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=260.04s)]
*  House for this path. I do not believe there is a majority for a second referendum. If [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=264.52s)]
*  I am right, then just as the Government are having to think again about their approach, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=272.08s)]
*  so too do those Members who believe this is the answer. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=277.4s)]
*  The remaining issues raised in the discussions relate to the substance of the deal, and on [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=281.68s)]
*  these points I believe we can make progress. Members of this House, predominantly but not [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=286.28s)]
*  only on the Government benches in the DUP, continue to express their concern on the Northern [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=291.0s)]
*  Ireland backstop. All of us agree that as we leave the European Union we must fully [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  respect the Belfast agreement and not allow the creation of a hard border between Northern [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  Ireland and Ireland, nor indeed a border down the Irish Sea. I want to be absolutely clear [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=306.16s)]
*  in the light of media stories this morning that this Government will not reopen the Belfast [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=312.36s)]
*  agreement. I have never even considered doing so, and neither would I. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=317.52s)]
*  With regard to the backstop, despite the changes we have previously agreed, there remain two [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=323.56s)]
*  core issues—the fear that we could be trapped in it permanently and concerns over its potential [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=328.6s)]
*  impact on our union if Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=333.76s)]
*  So I will be talking further this week to colleagues, including in the DUP, to consider [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=338.88s)]
*  how we might meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland in a way that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=342.92s)]
*  can command the greatest possible support in the House. I will then take the conclusions [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  of those discussions back to the EU. From other parts of this House, concerns have also [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  been raised over the political declaration. In particular, these have focused on a wish [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=357.52s)]
*  for further precision around the future relationship. The political declaration will provide the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=362.04s)]
*  basis for developing our detailed negotiating mandate for the future, and this new phase [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=367.36s)]
*  of negotiations will be different in a number of ways. It will cover a far broader range [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=372.26s)]
*  of issues in greater depth, and so will require us to build a negotiating team that draws [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=377.04s)]
*  on the widest expertise available, from trade negotiators to security experts and specialists [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  in data and financial services. As we develop our mandate across each of these areas, I [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  want to provide reassurance to the House. Given the breadth of the negotiations, we [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  will seek input from a wide range of voices from outside Government. That must include [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=397.76000000000005s)]
*  ensuring Parliament has a proper say and fuller involvement in these decisions. It is Government's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=402.76000000000005s)]
*  responsibility to negotiate, but it is also my responsibility to listen to the legitimate [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=409.28s)]
*  concerns of colleagues, both those who voted leave and those who voted remain, in shaping [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=414.64s)]
*  our negotiating mandate for our future partnership with the EU. The Government will consult this [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  House on its negotiating mandate to ensure that Members have the chance to make their [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=425.08s)]
*  views known and that we harness the knowledge of all select committees across the full range [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  of expertise needed for this next phase of negotiations, from security to trade. This [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=434.2s)]
*  will also strengthen the Government's hand in the negotiations, giving the EU confidence [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=439.96s)]
*  about our position and avoiding leaving the bulk of parliamentary debate to a point when [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=444.9s)]
*  we are under huge time pressure to ratify. I know that to date Parliament has not felt [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=449.4s)]
*  it has enough visibility of the Government's position as it has been developed and negotiated. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  It has sought documents through humble addresses, but that mechanism cannot take into account [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=459.16s)]
*  the fact that some information, when made public, could weaken the UK's negotiating [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=464.42s)]
*  hand. So as the negotiations progress, we will also look to deliver confidential committee [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=469.12s)]
*  sessions that can ensure Parliament has the most up-to-date information whilst not undermining [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=475.24s)]
*  the negotiations. We will regularly update the House, in particular before the six-monthly [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=480.72s)]
*  review points, with the EU foreseen in the agreement. While it will always be for Her [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=485.72s)]
*  Majesty's Government to negotiate for the whole of the UK, we are also committed to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=493.16s)]
*  giving the devolved Administrations an enhanced role in the next phase, respecting their competence [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  and vital interests in these negotiations. I hope to meet both First Ministers in the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=503.16s)]
*  course of this week and will use the opportunity to discuss this further with them. We will [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=508.8s)]
*  also look for further ways to engage elected representatives from Northern Ireland and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=513.58s)]
*  regional representatives in England. Finally, we will reach out beyond this House and engage [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=518.34s)]
*  more deeply with businesses, civil society and trade unions. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=523.44s)]
*  Fifth, honourable Members from across the House have raised strong views that our exit [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=527.62s)]
*  from the EU should not lead to a reduction in our social and environmental standards [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=535.7800000000001s)]
*  and in particular workers' rights. I will ensure that we provide Parliament with a guarantee [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=540.74s)]
*  that not only will we not erode protection for workers' rights and the environment, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=546.3s)]
*  but we will ensure that this country leads the way. To that end, my right hon. Friend [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=551.16s)]
*  the Business Secretary indicated the Government's support for the proposed amendment to the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=555.34s)]
*  meaningful vote put down by the hon. Member for Bassett Law, including that Parliament [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=559.7s)]
*  should be able to consider any changes made by the EU in these areas in future. My right [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=563.98s)]
*  honourable friend and others will work with Members across the House, businesses and trade [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=569.24s)]
*  unions to develop proposals that give effect to this amendment, including looking at legislation [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=574.34s)]
*  when necessary. Sixth and crucially, a number of Members have made powerful representations [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=579.64s)]
*  about the anxieties facing EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU who are waiting [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=586.12s)]
*  to have their status confirmed. We have already committed to ensuring that EU citizens in [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=592.74s)]
*  the UK will be able to stay and to continue to access in-country benefits and services [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=598.08s)]
*  on broadly the same terms as now in both a deal and a no-deal scenario. Indeed, the next [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  phase of testing of the scheme for EU nationals to confirm their status has launched today. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=610.2800000000001s)]
*  Having listened to concerns from Members and organisations like the 3 million group, I [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=616.3000000000001s)]
*  can confirm today that when we roll out the scheme in full on 30 March, the Government [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  will waive the application fee so that there is no financial barrier for any EU nationals [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=626.92s)]
*  who wish to stay. Anyone who has or will apply during the pilot phase will have their fee [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=637.64s)]
*  reimbursed and more details about how this will work will be made available in due course. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  Some EU Member states have similarly guaranteed the rights of British nationals in a no-deal [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=652.92s)]
*  scenario and we will step up our efforts to ensure that they all do so. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  Let me briefly set out the process for the days ahead. In addition to this statement, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  today I will lay a written ministerial statement, as required under section 13.4 and 5 of the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=669.04s)]
*  EU Withdrawal Act, and table a motion in neutral terms on this statement, as required by section [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=675.04s)]
*  13.6. This motion will be amendable and will be debated and voted on in this House on 29 [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=681.5999999999999s)]
*  January and I will provide a further update to the House during that debate. To be clear, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=687.16s)]
*  this is not a rerun of the vote to ratify the agreement we have reached with the European [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=692.4799999999999s)]
*  Union but the fulfilment of the process following the House's decision to reject that motion. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=696.04s)]
*  The process of engagement is ongoing. In the next few days my ministerial colleagues and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=702.2199999999999s)]
*  I will continue to meet with Members on all sides of the House and with representatives [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  of the trade unions, business groups, civil society and others as we try to find the broadest [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=711.4799999999999s)]
*  possible consensus on a way forward. Whilst I will disappoint those colleagues who hope [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  to secure a second referendum, I do not believe that there is a majority in this House for [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=721.0799999999999s)]
*  such a path. Whilst I want to deliver a deal with the EU, I cannot support the only other [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=725.8s)]
*  way in which to take no deal off the table, which is to revoke article 50. So my focus [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=733.4s)]
*  continues to be on what is needed to secure the support of this House in favour of a Brexit [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=739.28s)]
*  deal with the EU. My sense so far is that the three key changes are needed. First, we [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=744.4399999999999s)]
*  will be more flexible, open and inclusive in the future in how we engage Parliament [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=750.6s)]
*  in our approach to negotiating our future partnership with the European Union. Second, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=754.68s)]
*  we will embed the strongest possible protections on workers' rights and the environment. Third, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=759.8s)]
*  we will work to identify how we can ensure that our commitment to no hard border in Northern [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=764.68s)]
*  Ireland and Ireland can be delivered in a way that commands the support of this House [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=769.12s)]
*  and the European Union. In doing so, we will honour the mandate of the British people and [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=773.7199999999999s)]
*  leave the European Union in a way which benefits every part of our United Kingdom and every [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=779.4s)]
*  citizen of our country, and I commend this statement to the House. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6LxVoTzF4&t=784.4799999999999s)]
