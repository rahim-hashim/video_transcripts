# President Trump says negotiations will begin on Ukraine after call with Putin | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s)
*  Well, talking of Moscow, just in the last 10 minutes or so, a lot of information coming [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=0.0s)]
*  and dropping that President Putin and Donald Trump have had a long phone call today. What [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=5.22s)]
*  are you hearing about the contents of that call? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=11.9s)]
*  Well, no more than you. I wasn't on the call. But they have a rapport. They have a personal [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=14.14s)]
*  relationship which is in some ways quite troubling because during President Trump's first term [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  in office, he very publicly said he preferred to listen to President Putin rather than his [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=26.42s)]
*  own intelligence agencies, which was a real shock to the intelligence community in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=33.24s)]
*  United States. But there is a very close working relationship between US and British intelligence [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=37.78s)]
*  agencies, the CIA, the FBI, MI6 and so on. But the fact that these two leaders do have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=43.88s)]
*  something to talk about I think is quite promising. You've got to remember what President Trump's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=51.16s)]
*  priorities are. For him, it's about securing the southern border. It's about trade. It's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=55.58s)]
*  about China. He's not that interested in Europe. And his big message, going back also to what [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  his defence secretary has been saying to America's NATO partners in Europe, is Ukraine is kind [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=68.46s)]
*  of your problem. This is Europe. You sort it out. You spend more on defence. Spending, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=74.9s)]
*  agonising over whether, in the case of Britain, to raise it from 2.3 to 2.5 per cent. He's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=80.18s)]
*  thrown all of that out of the window and demanded 5 per cent. Well, America doesn't even spend [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=85.62s)]
*  5 per cent of its GDP on defence. It's unaffordable for most European nations. But you've got [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=89.18s)]
*  countries, big countries like Spain and Italy, that spend less than the mandated 2 per cent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=95.22000000000001s)]
*  And America is saying, why should the US taxpayer have to shoulder that burden if you're not [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=100.62s)]
*  prepared to pay for your own defence? So this really today has been, I think, a bit of a cold shower for both Ukraine and for NATO. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=107.52s)]
*  Frank, thanks very much. And coming on top of those details, Frank, giving us, let me [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=113.52s)]
*  just give you a few more of those details from that call being reported out of America, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  also being reported out of Moscow. Both sides talking about the call saying that both leaders [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=121.88s)]
*  have invited each other to their countries and President Trump saying he will call President [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=128.44s)]
*  Zelensky right now, that's the quote, to inform him of that call with Vladimir Putin [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=133.62s)]
*  in Moscow, also putting out notions that perhaps negotiations on a ceasefire can move forward. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=138.74s)]
*  So that story is clearly moving. When we get more, we'll obviously return to it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BL0f0rIa2s&t=147.42000000000002s)]
