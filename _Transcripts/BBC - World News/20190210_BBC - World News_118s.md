Video Description: China's biggest hotpot restaurant chain by sales, Haidilao, started almost 25 years ago and has already established more than 360 restaurants around the world, including in Japan, the US and Taiwan.
The popular chain has opened Beijing's first robot-aided hotpot restaurant to much fanfare and is looking to spread the concept across its other outlets if it proves successful.

*  When you think of a Chinese restaurant, do you think of robot kitchen hands? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=0.0s)]
*  Robot waiters? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=7.0s)]
*  Or galactic visions? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=12.0s)]
*  Well, perhaps that perception is about to change. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=15.0s)]
*  Excuse me, I'm going to get angry. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=19.0s)]
*  In our industry, labour will become more expensive, while machines will keep getting cheaper. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=31.0s)]
*  It's really good. I'm a loyal fan of Haidilao and this place has robots serving you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=39.0s)]
*  So I have brought my friends here to see it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=64.0s)]
*  The older hot pot restaurants didn't have this feel. It's something novel, it's new. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=69.0s)]
*  Robots have no feelings. They do what's asked of them without introducing anything harmful from outside. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=83.0s)]
*  It improves food safety and productivity. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGm5RU8610k&t=89.0s)]
