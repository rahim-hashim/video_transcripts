*  police spokesman says that he appears to have killed himself. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=54.4s)]

*  And Bethany, tell us a little bit about the police operation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=68.24s)]
*  I understand that's still ongoing in the area. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=70.72s)]
*  Yes, apparently what we understand is that they're evacuating the school building. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=75.2s)]
*  There are a lot of police forces there, including special units. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  And the police have asked all the people around about to avoid the school and to obey the advice [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=86.0s)]
*  of the security forces. But this is a large police operation, we're told, in Graz with a number of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=94.56s)]
*  dead here. And just to give us an idea of this, the area, I mean, Graz is quite a big city. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=102.32s)]
*  A very big city in Austria, south of Vienna. And this is a big secondary school, we understand, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=109.52s)]
*  in the Dreier Schützengasse. And this is, we understand that according to these media reports, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=118.8s)]
*  it was a school, a pupil at the school who appears to have shot in school. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  And since we spoke to Bethany, police have said that, have confirmed that several people have [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=134.24s)]
*  been killed in that school shooting. We've had a spokesperson talking a little while earlier, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=138.48s)]
*  let me bring you what he said. He said, we cannot confirm or yet determine whether we're talking [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  about one attacker or more at this point. But we can say that the situation is now under control [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=148.32s)]
*  and there's no further danger to the public. The school kids have been evacuated and are taking [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=153.28s)]
*  refuge nearby. Parents also have a gathering point. There are crisis management teams at both [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  locations to help people, even for those who haven't been physically harmed. But still, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=164.08s)]
*  there are several fatalities. So police confirming several fatalities in that school shooting in Graz [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=168.96s)]
*  in southern Austria. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02AZF_v5ZU&t=174.4s)]
