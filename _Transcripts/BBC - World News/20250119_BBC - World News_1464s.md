Video Description: The long-awaited ceasefire in the war in Gaza has come into force, after a three-hour delay.

Hamas has named the first three Israeli hostages it plans to free first later today - 31-year-old Doron Steinbrecher and dual British-Israeli Emily Damari, 28, who were kidnapped from their kibbutz, as well as 24-year-old Romi Gonen, who was taken from the Supernova Festival.

The ceasefire was due to start at 08:30 (06:30 GMT) on Sunday but was delayed last-minute after Hamas failed to give Israel the list of the three hostages in time - Hamas says it was due to "technical field reasons".

Up until the ceasefire came into force, Israel continued to carry out strikes on Gaza, with 13 people reported by the Hamas-run civil defence agency to have been killed since the truce was meant to start.

# Gaza ceasefire begins after delay as Hamas names first Israeli hostages to be freed | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es)
*  That is right. Thank you, Mark. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=0.0s)]
*  As we are seeing the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, let me read to [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=2.0s)]
*  you what they said. It is a very short announcement. The Prime [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=6.0s)]
*  Minister's Office this morning said, pursuant to the framework for [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=9.0s)]
*  the release of the hostages, the ceasefire of the first stage in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=12.0s)]
*  Gaza will take effect at 11.15 local time. It is now 11.15. Remember, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=16.0s)]
*  this is something which was supposed to happen at 8.30 this morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=21.0s)]
*  We found out in the hour or so before that that there were issues [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=26.0s)]
*  with Hamas actually providing that list of hostages. We know that a [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=31.0s)]
*  lot of work went on behind the scenes to actually get the names of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=35.0s)]
*  those first three women to be released into Israeli hands. In fact, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=39.0s)]
*  now that has happened. It happened, we were told, about 30 minutes or [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=43.0s)]
*  so ago. This move to a ceasefire has happened very quickly. I just [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=47.0s)]
*  want to show you as well live pictures that we have been watching [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=51.0s)]
*  live this morning here on BBC News of the situation in Gaza. If you have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=54.0s)]
*  been with us, you will have seen repeatedly on those live pictures [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=58.0s)]
*  the sight of plumes of smoke, the sight of continuing Israeli airstrikes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=62.0s)]
*  there in Gaza. In fact, this morning, the civil defence in Gaza, they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=67.0s)]
*  gave a figure at about 9.30 local time whereby they said that 25 people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=72.0s)]
*  had been wounded and eight people had been killed in the time after 8.30, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=77.0s)]
*  the time when the fighting should have stopped. But we can now say that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=83.0s)]
*  the ceasefire, the first phase of the ceasefire has come into effect. I [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=87.0s)]
*  want to keep showing you these live pictures of what's happening in Gaza [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=92.0s)]
*  while we talk about what will now begin and the next thing that we will [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=96.0s)]
*  see will be two things actually, one that is very specific to Israel, one [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=101.0s)]
*  that is very specific to Gaza. So in terms of those hostages, those three [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=105.0s)]
*  female hostages who have been named by Hamas this morning, the process will [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=110.0s)]
*  begin to actually return them here to Israeli soil. And the way that that is [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=114.0s)]
*  expected to work is the same as things worked in the last ceasefire, which is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=119.0s)]
*  that they will be handed over to the Red Cross inside Gaza. The Red Cross [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=123.0s)]
*  will then transfer them to the Israeli military. They will be checked over, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=128.0s)]
*  they will be checked over physically, there will be psychological checks as [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=133.0s)]
*  well. Then they will be brought to hospitals here in Israel and they will [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=137.0s)]
*  be reunited with their loved ones. At almost exactly the same time, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=141.0s)]
*  displaced Palestinian families in Gaza will be able to start to return home. In [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=146.0s)]
*  fact, we know that that is something that they started to do this morning. A [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=151.0s)]
*  lot of people were already packed, they were ready to go, ready to move when [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=155.0s)]
*  that ceasefire was delayed. But phase one of this deal involves the Israeli [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=159.0s)]
*  military pulling their troops, pulling their physical soldiers out of the most [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=163.0s)]
*  populated areas of Gaza and actually moving them towards pre-agreed points, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=167.0s)]
*  areas within the Gaza Strip that have been determined through the mediators [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=173.0s)]
*  and agreed on between Hamas and Israel. And then people will start to return, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=178.0s)]
*  particularly to the northern areas of the Strip, many places where people [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=182.0s)]
*  haven't been for many, many months now. We're just hearing that the release of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=186.0s)]
*  those hostages, this is from the Israeli Prime Minister's office again, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=192.0s)]
*  will take place. Now, they put this timing into GMT, 2pm they say, so [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=196.0s)]
*  essentially in just less than three hours, those hostages will be released. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=202.0s)]
*  But as I was just describing to you there, it is not a quick process. The [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=207.0s)]
*  actual release involves them being moved within Gaza. When I think back to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=211.0s)]
*  the last ceasefire when I was here, they consider a hostage to be released [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=216.0s)]
*  when they're actually back on Israeli soil. That tends to be the moment at [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=220.0s)]
*  which they consider that that hostage has been successfully released to a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=224.0s)]
*  place of safety. The Israeli Prime Minister's office also says that four [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=228.0s)]
*  other living hostages will be released in seven days' time. And that, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=233.0s)]
*  again, fits with the framework of this very complex and detailed agreement [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=238.0s)]
*  which has been hammered out over many, many months now between Israel and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=243.0s)]
*  Hamas, but always through those mediators from Qatar, from Egypt, and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=248.0s)]
*  also from the US as well. Let's talk to Rushdie Abu al-Luf, our Gaza [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=253.0s)]
*  correspondent who was in Istanbul. Rushdie, we do now have that ceasefire [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=257.0s)]
*  that is so long awaited. You were telling us earlier about that it can be [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=262.0s)]
*  very slow for that news to actually filter through to people there in Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=267.0s)]
*  Have you had any immediate reaction from people there? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=271.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, people are still saying that they can hear the buzzing of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=278.0s)]
*  Israeli drones in some certain areas, especially in Khajounis. The latest [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=282.0s)]
*  figure from the Hamas-run civil defence that 13 people were killed and more [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=287.0s)]
*  than 35 people were injured. Some of the criticism for Hamas, I have seen, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=292.0s)]
*  noticed people in social media saying that this delay is causing 13 people to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=298.0s)]
*  be killed. Those people were waiting to enjoy the ceasefire. Now, it is still [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=304.0s)]
*  very complicated process because back in November, the first ceasefire [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=311.0s)]
*  agreement, Hamas was still in a better condition. They were able to function [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=316.0s)]
*  properly and control the streets. So today, it is going to be very chaotic. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=322.0s)]
*  We don't know exactly how Hamas will operate to hand over those hostages to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=327.0s)]
*  the Israelis. So it is very complicated and just show how fragile the ceasefire [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=333.0s)]
*  is if they fail after working for four days. You know, they announced in the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=339.0s)]
*  15th and it took four days for the mediators and Hamas to prepare for this [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=344.0s)]
*  and already the delay was three hours and just sending the names. So very big [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=350.0s)]
*  question over how the rest of the process is going to continue. People are hoping [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=356.0s)]
*  that it is going to be smooth, but I don't think it is going to be smooth [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=363.0s)]
*  because it is a very complicated situation. One of the other issues that we [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=366.0s)]
*  have seen Israeli airstrikes targeting two or three cars belong to the Hamas [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=371.0s)]
*  militants. We have been watching videos and images come from Gaza for Hamas [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=376.0s)]
*  militants in cars trying to celebrate in the middle of Gaza. As I understand part [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=382.0s)]
*  of what is called security protocol, Hamas is allowed just to show a police in a [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=388.0s)]
*  blue official uniform and not carrying weapons if not necessarily. That's exactly [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=396.0s)]
*  what the deal is talking about and it seems that the Egyptian and the Qataris, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=403.0s)]
*  the mediators are quite worried about a lot of small details involving in this [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=409.0s)]
*  and each party of this agreement has his own explanation of the terms. Hamas said [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=414.0s)]
*  it's 800 meters above arzoon, but we have seen map published by Israel yesterday [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=420.0s)]
*  showing in some area 1.2 a kilo and 200 meters in some of the area. So it is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=425.0s)]
*  not very clear for the people where exactly they can go, where they can't go, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=432.0s)]
*  who's going to monitor, who's going to do this process in the ground, who's going [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=437.0s)]
*  to be functioning. So the process is complicated and might be further [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=444.0s)]
*  complicated if the mediators are not finding a solution with Hamas to this. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=449.0s)]
*  And of course as you've said before Rushdie, when you talked about obviously the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=457.0s)]
*  difficulty of communication there in Gaza is actually letting people who aren't [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=460.0s)]
*  living in proper houses, who are living in tents, who are displaced, who often [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=465.0s)]
*  don't have mobile phone signal or indeed electricity to charge their phone, we've [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=470.0s)]
*  had things like leaflet drops and that sort of thing before, but actually just [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=474.0s)]
*  getting through these details. If it's a very fine route that people are allowed [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=478.0s)]
*  to take, it's hard to actually communicate that to a displaced population, isn't it? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=482.0s)]
*  It is, yeah, the communication is very hard so we understand that the Egyptians [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=490.0s)]
*  and the Qataris are going to send a team on the ground, the two main Palestinian [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=494.0s)]
*  mobile carriers, they are supposed to bring some equipment from Egypt as an [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=500.0s)]
*  emergency. I think tomorrow or after tomorrow they would be allowed to deploy [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=507.0s)]
*  some of the equipment in Gaza to make the network more stronger and more reliable [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=512.0s)]
*  for the people so there's a lot of job has to be done for the people. And you know [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=519.0s)]
*  the mediators were expecting the trouble within a week when more than 1.2 million [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=526.0s)]
*  people were to move from the south into the north. They were expecting the trouble [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=532.0s)]
*  after one week but you know trouble came in the first hour. The mood in Gaza now [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=537.0s)]
*  is that people were up all night waiting for this. They have been waiting day after [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=544.0s)]
*  day, minute after minute for the last 15 months for this and suddenly they woke up [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=551.0s)]
*  in the news of more people are being killed. So now I think their reaction will be a [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=556.0s)]
*  little bit more cautious because they don't know exactly if it's a real ceasefire on [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=563.0s)]
*  the ground or if it's just a fragile ceasefire. Thank you. Correspondent joining us [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=568.0s)]
*  from Istanbul who has already been speaking to people there since the ceasefire came [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=578.0s)]
*  into effect ten minutes ago now. We of course now know as part of that the identity [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=583.0s)]
*  released by Hamas on their Telegram channel of the three hostages, female hostages who [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=590.0s)]
*  will be handed over or the process at least we're told will happen at around 4 o'clock [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=596.0s)]
*  local here, 2 o'clock GMT. They are Emily Demary, the British Israeli hostage, now [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=601.0s)]
*  28 years old. Rony Goonan who was taken from the Nova Music Festival who was on the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=607.0s)]
*  phone to her mum at the moment when she was actually taken by Hamas militants and taken [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=613.0s)]
*  away to be held hostage in Gaza. And also Doron Steinbrecher who is a veterinary nurse [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=618.0s)]
*  who was in her apartment in Kaffa Azza, that kibbutz that was so devastated by Hamas on [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=623.0s)]
*  that day who was taken from her home and taken hostage. And I spoke a little earlier to a [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=629.0s)]
*  hostage family member. They have become a very close, a very tight group all unified [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=635.0s)]
*  by this terrible experience that they've been through. And Gil Dickman and I were talking [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=640.0s)]
*  when we still didn't know what was happening with the time of the ceasefire that he was [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=645.0s)]
*  really explaining a lot of the emotions that go through the minds of those hostage families [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=649.0s)]
*  while they're waiting for news. It's like a roller coaster because you know you're [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=655.0s)]
*  expecting something good. You know you might see your loved one in just a few hours but [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=660.0s)]
*  everything is at stake because it could all collapse in just one moment. And we see it [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=665.0s)]
*  with this delay. We know that the next few days are going to be a nightmare for all of [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=670.0s)]
*  us but it is going to end. And that's another reason why we have to start with it as quickly [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=674.0s)]
*  as possible. Hamas should have given the list already. Give the list. Let's start the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=680.0s)]
*  negotiation for the next phases of the deal and finish with it as quickly as possible [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=686.0s)]
*  because it's going to be a nightmare for all of us if we don't. At moments like this, just [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=692.0s)]
*  share how emotional it is. I mean I can see from looking at you and I know from conversations [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=698.0s)]
*  I've had with you here before how emotional these moments are particularly for those families [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=704.0s)]
*  who are expecting their loved ones to be in this part of the deal. These moments are [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=709.0s)]
*  agonizing. Yeah. On the one hand you think oh my god she might be coming in just a few [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=714.0s)]
*  hours. You start to think about what you're going to get for her. You start you know packing [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=719.0s)]
*  the luggage for the moment she's here. And on the other hand you keep remembering that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=724.0s)]
*  it all might collapse in just one moment and that's really agonizing as you said. For all of us [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=730.0s)]
*  it is bittersweet here today because it's good to see this ceasefire finally on the way [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=736.0s)]
*  but it's too late already. It's too late already for Karmel who was supposed to be on the list for [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=743.0s)]
*  this very very ceasefire. It is very few. And it's too late for all the hostages here that are still [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=749.0s)]
*  there actually because it's not it doesn't matter even who comes out today. There have been [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=757.0s)]
*  471 days in captivity. That's way way too long and I don't want to start thinking about what [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=763.0s)]
*  they've been through there. That's all in our minds as families of hostages. That's definitely [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=772.0s)]
*  in the minds of the families who are awaiting family members. But the most important thing is that we [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=777.0s)]
*  start because we want this war to end. And what I'm afraid of is that this is only a temporary [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=783.0s)]
*  ceasefire that will see only 33 hostages coming and then the war will resume. This is not what we want. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=791.0s)]
*  We want this ceasefire to start as quickly as possible and then to end this war completely with [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=798.0s)]
*  all 97 hostages coming back home. We had one hostage that was right now rescued from Gaza. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=805.0s)]
*  The body of hostage actually Oron Shaul that's been there for 10 years. Three more hostages that have been in Gaza [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=814.0s)]
*  for 10 years. We have to get this over with. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=822.0s)]
*  That is Gil Dickman. Karmel who was talking about Karmel Gatt, his cousin who was killed while being held [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=828.0s)]
*  hostage in Gaza. Let's talk to Lise Doucet, our chief international correspondent. Lise, we are now in a position [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=834.0s)]
*  where this ceasefire has taken effect and now we expect a process to unfold over the rest of today and indeed [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=840.0s)]
*  over the next few weeks and months and probably years. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=846.0s)]
*  And I believe there's huge, must be huge relief now mixed with anger, with anxiety that after a delay [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=853.0s)]
*  of a few hours, the ceasefire has now begun at 11.15 local time. Long after the 6.30 start, which was said [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=862.0s)]
*  yesterday would be the moment where the guns fall silent, where Palestinians can know that they're not going to be [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=872.0s)]
*  killed in the streets or under attack in their homes and Israeli, the families of the Israeli hostages know that [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=879.0s)]
*  three of their loved ones will be coming home and that if this process continues without any hitches, without any [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=886.0s)]
*  backsliding, that even more will come home. More than 30 in this first phase. But this delay has reminded us again [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=894.0s)]
*  of just how much this process will be fraught with risk, fraught with danger and a real risk that it could all unravel. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=902.0s)]
*  But right now the mediators, Qatar and Egypt, the telephone lines were burning this morning as they tried to resolve [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=910.0s)]
*  what was happening, which was what was happening with this delay. But for now it has begun and the relief must be [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=917.0s)]
*  palpable in the Gaza Strip. My colleague Rushdie Abu Aluf, Rush I know you're in constant contact with people in Gaza. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=925.0s)]
*  What are you hearing now? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=932.0s)]
*  Well, I was allowed to read this message from my father and other messages from Gaza this morning. Everybody was, you know, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=934.0s)]
*  very optimistic. They were writing nice messages about one of them saying that nothing in the sky but bird. And he had to [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=944.0s)]
*  delay this message for three, four hours. For now, the people are hope that this ceasefire will last. It's Gaza under [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=953.0s)]
*  ceasefire is the word that 2.3 million people have been waiting day after day, night after night, minute after minute. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=963.0s)]
*  And now this seems to be finally happy with this result. Yes, about 13 people were killed. Some of the people in Gaza [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=971.0s)]
*  were criticizing Hamas for delaying the name saying that any delay would cost lives in Gaza for the people. They are [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=980.0s)]
*  hoping that ceasefire will last and within one week, 1.2 million people will be allowed to take this very complicated [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=991.0s)]
*  journey through a security check to move back to their neighborhoods, to their places in the north. Yes, they are happy, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=999.0s)]
*  but they are also worried because most of those who are displaced a year or over a year ago, they don't have a place to [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1007.0s)]
*  stay anymore as 60 to 70 percent of their homes were destroyed, especially in Jabalia refugee camp. This is the biggest [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1015.0s)]
*  camp in Gaza with about 250,000 people are there. Israel conducted about 100 day operation, destroyed 90 percent of the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1023.0s)]
*  camp according to the Hamas authority in Gaza, which also Hamas said that they have deployed thousands of policemen in [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1033.0s)]
*  the street to make sure that the life is back to normal. They said that they will work according to a plan that they are [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1044.0s)]
*  set up with the mediators to restore law and order in Gaza. But you know, at least, that Hamas has suffered a lot of [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1053.0s)]
*  destruction, not only in terms of military infrastructure, but also in the government level and in the political level in [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1061.0s)]
*  Gaza. So we need to wait and see how they can function to restore law and order. We have seen gangs in the bus stealing aid [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1070.0s)]
*  coming into Gaza, and we're supposed to see 600 trucks every day allowed from Egypt into Gaza to those people who are in need, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1081.0s)]
*  the people who are suffering and getting less than 20 percent of what is needed for the last 15 months, those who are having to live in [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1091.0s)]
*  makeshift tents for a very long time and waiting for a better situation when the aid is going to be set up into Gaza. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1100.0s)]
*  Rishi, thank you very much for sharing with us that very poignant message from your father. It's a message which speaks to the pain [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1110.0s)]
*  and the anxiety and cautious hope of so many Palestinians. What do you, just give us a sense, you also had to, you were forced to leave [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1117.0s)]
*  your home in the north of the Gaza Strip. You know, you've seen images that it lies in ruin. So many who, like you, who are watching, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1127.0s)]
*  from afar will also be feeling this torrent of emotions this morning. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1136.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course, it is very emotional for me. I was, you know, covered five wars before in Gaza. I was always there when the ceasefire is declared, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1146.0s)]
*  talking to people. And you know, journalism is all about being able to be in the place, talk to the people in the place. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1158.0s)]
*  We had to leave, you know, our house over a year ago. We had to leave the place that we belong to and we love Gaza after one year. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1165.0s)]
*  And we have been watching day and night what's going on there. Now, it's a bit of relief for us and not only for me, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1175.0s)]
*  but about 120,000 Palestinians who were allowed out of Gaza since the war. I have been to them. I've been visited Egypt, Qatar, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1182.0s)]
*  London, Turkey, everywhere, and they are all sharing the same concern about the future of Gaza. Most of them, like the people in Gaza, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1192.0s)]
*  they lost their homes, they lost their offices, their businesses. And now it's time to think about the future, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1202.0s)]
*  which seems to be uncertain and unclear, especially with the level of destruction in Gaza and who's going to be in charge of this place. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1209.0s)]
*  Who's going to put this effort to rebuild 70% of the homes, maybe 80% of the schools, universities, infrastructure, sewage system, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1219.0s)]
*  electricity system, communication? So it's a lot of work. And people are hoping that some sort of Palestinian internal dispute can be solved. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1231.0s)]
*  And then they can hope that one day they will be able to return back to their place that they love, Gaza. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1241.0s)]
*  Yeah. And as you've already indicated, these first steps towards returning to their own lives, and it will be such a long and difficult, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1250.0s)]
*  if not dangerous road, but there is the very real risk. And you've been emphasizing this today that this whole process of return could be marred, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1259.0s)]
*  could be delayed by chaos, the sheer desperation of people to leave, the criminality because of the desperation of the people who are [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1268.0s)]
*  in Gaza, because of the desperation of people. Do you see in the details of this agreement, the kind of mechanisms to be put in place to try to mitigate [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1279.0s)]
*  this kind of problem? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1289.0s)]
*  I think before we came to the end of this first stage, 42 days, because nobody, even Hamas, I had like hundreds of calls and I have met most of the Hamas leaders [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1296.0s)]
*  from Ismail Haniya to his deputy to everybody and the all concerned about the second stage. They believe that Israel want as much hostages as possible [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1307.0s)]
*  in the first stage and they want to resume to the fight again. This is a real concern for Hamas, but also a real concern for all of the Gaza, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1317.0s)]
*  whether they are inside or outside. So it's going to be very difficult six weeks to judge. It's very early to judge whether this ceasefire agreement will end [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1326.0s)]
*  the war. So before we have this clear vision about the war would be and nobody can plan anything, especially is now the issue of the Rafah crossing. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1336.0s)]
*  Now the Egyptians are saying that they want to reopen the Rafah crossing. There is a meeting in Cairo involving the PA, Palestinian Authority, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1348.0s)]
*  head of the crossings. He was in the meeting. They are talking about a mechanism to reopen the crossing. You know that 90% of the crossing itself is destroyed. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1355.0s)]
*  So they need a lot of work just to repair Rafah crossing and then they will start to talk who's going to be in charge of the crossing. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1365.0s)]
*  Is it the PA or some sort of technocrat? Is it going to see a new government within the PA? Who's going to be in charge of this? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1373.0s)]
*  How Hamas will react now in trying to impose law and order in Gaza? Would Hamas be accepted anymore to many Gaza after what some of the people [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1381.0s)]
*  or many people in Gaza equally accused Hamas of this, the aftermath of the 7th of October attack. So a lot of long debates started on the 7th of October, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1394.0s)]
*  continued throughout the war and we have seen more of more of this debate on social media. Those very small number of people who have access to the internet [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1405.0s)]
*  from Gaza but more widely Palestinians outside Gaza were all the time discussing and talking about this and they believe that without having internal Palestinian [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1416.0s)]
*  issue resolved Gaza will not enjoy any good future. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1427.0s)]
*  Rusti Abu Aluf as always thank you very much for joining us to bring us up to date. Not just with details of this unfolding moment, the ceasefire finally has begun [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1432.0s)]
*  but also posing the wider the questions, the very very almost existential questions about the way forward as if it is as widely hoped this process continues to unfold. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1446.0s)]
*  No doubt we will be speaking to you again, Rusti will let you go for now. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blomaNh59es&t=1459.0s)]
