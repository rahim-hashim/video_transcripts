Video Description: Canadian PM Mark Carney has said Canada is "not for sale" as US President Donald Trump insists the country would benefit from becoming the 51st US state.
 
Relations between the once close allies have been frayed in the wake of Trump's new tariff regime, as well as the comments, but the US president added that Canada's opposition to his proposal will not impact today's discussions.
 
Trump also said during the meeting that the US will "always" protect Canada. 
 
He also encouraged Carney to think of the US "as a super luxury store" while talking about international trade and added that other countries will come and pay a price, and the US will give them "very good deals".

*  in the crosshairs of President Trump through a crisis that we did not create. We will fight [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=41.16s)]

*  and car parts have all been hit hard by 25% tariffs when they are exported to America. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=53.16s)]
*  Can Mr Carney negotiate a tariff reduction? It's attitudes like this that will not make [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=59.0s)]
*  negotiations easier. I think it's really complex. I think this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=70.08s)]
*  is really complex. They have been basically feeding off of us for decades upon decades [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=75.44s)]
*  upon decades. They have their socialist regime. In the Oval Office, Donald Trump was asked [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=81.24s)]
*  if he still wants to take over Canada. It would really be a wonderful marriage because [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  it's two places that get along very well. They like each other a lot. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=91.88s)]
*  As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. We're sitting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  in one right now, Buckingham Palace, and having met with the owners of Canada over [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=104.64s)]
*  the course of the campaign last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=112.24s)]
*  Mr Trump acknowledged that they do have some tough points to discuss but says he thinks [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=118.2s)]
*  that will be fine. They'll be talking about the war in Ukraine as well. And he claims [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=122.36s)]
*  America will always be friends with Canada. While he had the TV cameras in the Oval Office, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=127.48s)]
*  Donald Trump took the opportunity to also make a couple of pretty big foreign policy [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=137.24s)]
*  announcements. First off, he said that Houthi rebels in Yemen had told the United States [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=141.12s)]
*  that they do not want to fight anymore, that they have pledged to stop attacking international [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=146.52s)]
*  shipping and that as a result, the US bombing campaign against them will be over effective [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=151.24s)]
*  immediately, said President Trump. And then he teased what he called a very, very big, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=157.04s)]
*  very, very positive announcement yet to come. He is leaving on a trip to the Middle East, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=162.72s)]
*  visiting Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar next week. And he said before he [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=168.44s)]
*  goes, he will make a really important announcement on a certain subject, he said, the most important [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=173.68s)]
*  that's been made for years, that may be something to do with the Middle East peace process, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=180.56s)]
*  it may be something else. We wait to find out either later this week or the beginning of next. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=185.12s)]
*  Indeed we will. Thank you very much. Sarah Smith reporting there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WlTAlsvkc&t=189.52s)]
