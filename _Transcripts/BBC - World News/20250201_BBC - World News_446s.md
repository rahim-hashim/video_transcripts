# Could Donald Trump end the Ukraine war? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo)
*  We have to live in the real world and accomplish what we can to save lives. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=0.0s)]
*  And I think that means freezing the conflict along the current battle line with the plan [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=4.0s)]
*  to start negotiations to figure out a way to get Ukraine back as much of its territory as possible. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=10.24s)]
*  Hello, this is Victoria Derbyshire in the Ukraine Car Studio. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=19.6s)]
*  And this is Vitaly Shevchenko also in the Ukraine Car Studio. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And let's introduce you to Fred Flight. Hello to you, Mr. Flight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=25.6s)]
*  Hello, how are you? Very well, thank you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=29.2s)]
*  I wonder if you could tell our listeners around the world a little bit about yourself. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=32.8s)]
*  Well, I'm vice chair of a new think tank in Washington, the America First Policy Institute. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=37.76s)]
*  We were set up after President Trump lost the last election and we've been promoting and defending [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=44.0s)]
*  his unique approach to government, both domestic policy and foreign policy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=51.04s)]
*  And importantly, you co-authored last year, along with Keith Kellogg, President Trump's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=55.2s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia envoy, a policy document with proposals to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=59.84s)]
*  And obviously, Keith Kellogg is going to be an absolute central player [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=66.8s)]
*  in any negotiations, any peace talks that may come down the track. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=71.28s)]
*  One of the key points, key thoughts that you put forward was this idea that a ceasefire [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=76.56s)]
*  needs to be sought and negotiated settlement. And the United States would continue to arm Ukraine [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=84.56s)]
*  and strengthen Ukraine's defenses, and I quote, to ensure that Russia will make no further advances. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=92.0s)]
*  Can you talk us through that specific point? Does that mean that as part of a deal, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=101.28s)]
*  what Vladimir Putin would get is the part of Ukraine that he currently occupies? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=106.56s)]
*  I think Putin has concerns about Ukraine joining NATO and an American or European military presence [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=112.08s)]
*  in Ukraine. I don't think that's a legitimate concern. The U.S. and its allies have no ambitions [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=122.24s)]
*  to invade Russia or to interfere in Russia, but Putin doesn't see it that way. And that's why we [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=130.88s)]
*  suggested that NATO membership be postponed for a set period of time. My personal position is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=135.92s)]
*  25 years. I think that's a good concession to offer to Russia. And we're not giving up very much [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  because I don't think the unanimous vote is there to add Ukraine as a member to NATO in the near [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=147.44s)]
*  future. So I know this isn't going to be pleasing to Zelensky and to the Ukrainian people, but I [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  don't think that's a lot to give up to end the war. And this would be a sort of security assurance [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=160.96s)]
*  by making sure that Ukraine has the weapons to defend itself so Russia doesn't use a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=166.88s)]
*  ceasefire to rearm and simply invade again. But in terms of territory, do you think, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=171.84s)]
*  well, it's fair or realistic to talk in terms of who keeps what, at least for the foreseeable [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=178.64s)]
*  future, just to make the killing stop? We call for freezing the conflict along the current battle [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  lines. And Ukraine does not give up its territorial claims. Ukraine does not give up its demand to get [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=195.04s)]
*  back all of its territory. That just isn't going to happen in the immediate future. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=201.12s)]
*  We've got a voice note here from one of our regular listeners. She is called Olga, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=205.92s)]
*  and she's a teacher who lives in Herson in southern Ukraine, near the front line, as you know. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=210.56s)]
*  And we asked her what she thought about the prospect of freezing the war along its current lines. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure that if the war freezes at the front line, it will be just a temporary stop of the fire. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=220.8s)]
*  Though if it lasted for a long time, we would not only lose territory, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=229.52s)]
*  but people, our children are trained to be Russians and hate Ukraine. Young men are enlisted [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  to their army. What will happen in a few years? I think that it is not the decision which will [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=247.11999999999998s)]
*  bring peace to Ukraine. Do you understand that worry that just pausing it, freezing it, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=256.64s)]
*  means it's not really over and Russia can come back? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=263.68s)]
*  This will be a very difficult solution for the Ukrainian people to accept. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=267.2s)]
*  This war has been brutal. And I mean, in a perfect world, we would put Putin and his generals and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=277.28s)]
*  officials in the Russian government on trial for war crimes, but we can't accomplish that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=285.2s)]
*  And if there was a way to get back all of Ukraine's territory, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  I think we should do that. I actually know a way to do that. We could send NATO troops in, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=294.32s)]
*  send British troops in. I don't think the British people want to send the British [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=298.96s)]
*  Army into Ukraine. I know the American people don't want the US Army to go in. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=302.56s)]
*  Because there's no willingness to do that. Another approach has to be found. And I know [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  it's distasteful. But we have to live in the real world and accomplish what we can to save lives. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=312.24s)]
*  And I think that means freezing the conflict along the current battle line with the plan [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=318.48s)]
*  to start negotiations to figure out a way to get Ukraine back as much of its territory as possible. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=324.72s)]
*  Do you think Vladimir Putin, well, as part of these negotiations, would want [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=331.6s)]
*  a bit more than just a delay to Ukraine's NATO membership? Because I'm sure you'll agree that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=336.8s)]
*  a large, well, huge reason for why he started his special military operation is control of Ukraine [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=343.76s)]
*  as a state and a nation, as well as territory. There's a lot of debates why Putin invaded Ukraine. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=351.12s)]
*  It's really a tragedy. I don't think his reasoning made any sense. I don't doubt that there will be [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=359.52s)]
*  pretty stiff demands by both sides if talks start. But at a minimum, we have to stop the fighting [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=366.4s)]
*  and begin peace talks, which may go on for many years. We may be looking at a situation similar [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=375.12s)]
*  to the Korean Peninsula with an armistice that may be in place for a long time before we have [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=382.4s)]
*  a final solution. We know in North Korea, it's been 75 years now, and there still is no peace [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=387.6s)]
*  treaty. And of course, President Zelensky would have to sell that to the Ukrainians. And [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=396.24s)]
*  you can imagine some Ukrainians going, we're never getting this land back. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=403.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, to be realistic, American military aid for Ukraine is not going to continue indefinitely. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  And if the Ukrainian government does not agree to peace talks, and I think ultimately ceasefire, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  they're not going to have the support they need to hold off the Russian army. So I think there [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=422.96s)]
*  will be an incentive to accept this. And I know many of them aren't going to be happy about it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=428.96s)]
*  Many of them aren't going to be happy about it. But if there's another way, I'd like to hear it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtgesUXqDo&t=433.2s)]
