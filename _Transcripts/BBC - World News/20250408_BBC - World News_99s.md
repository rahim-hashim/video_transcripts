# What is the stock market? #StockMarket #Stocks #DonaldTrump #Tariffs #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc)
*  We're seeing a lot of news today about stock markets falling around the world in response to Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=0.0s)]
*  What does that mean for young people in the UK? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  A lot of young people might work for some of these companies. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=7.72s)]
*  And if the value of the company goes down, it may mean these companies hold back on their investments so it doesn't hire as many new people. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=10.88s)]
*  It might mean that they're less likely to raise the wages. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  And young people are less likely to have savings on the stock market. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=21.36s)]
*  But they will have some. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=24.52s)]
*  And often through their work pension schemes, they have this thing called auto enrollment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=25.8s)]
*  So they automatically get a bit of their pay deducted and put into a pension scheme. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=30.28s)]
*  And that will quite often be invested in the stock market. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=34.8s)]
*  So if you're saving into a pension, you're not going to try and get that money for decades and decades to come. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=37.84s)]
*  So in that sense, you shouldn't panic about it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=43.4s)]
*  What is the stock market? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=45.64s)]
*  The stock market is a way of valuing all the companies in the world, pretty much, which have floated on the stock market. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=46.72s)]
*  What do you mean by floated? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=54.64s)]
*  Not every company puts its shares on the stock market. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  The ones which are sold to everyday public like you and me, those are called floated companies or listed companies. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=58.8s)]
*  And those are the ones where you see the value going up and down every day. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=65.04s)]
*  Some people might have stocks and shares ISA. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=67.92s)]
*  Are they going to be feeling the hit? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=71.0s)]
*  Well, if their stocks and shares are invested in some of these markets, which have been dropping really rapidly, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=72.36s)]
*  then it's more than likely that they will have on paper lost quite a lot of money over the past month. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=78.12s)]
*  Is now a good time to buy? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=84.12s)]
*  There are a lot of people who say that the best time to buy is when the stock market is falling because people tend to panic. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=85.24s)]
*  And so they get all their money out of stocks and shares. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=92.32s)]
*  But the history of the stock market is that it always goes up over a very long period. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzmhIoPiMc&t=94.84s)]
