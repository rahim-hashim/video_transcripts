# President Zelensky rejects Trump’s bid for $500bn of Ukraine’s natural resources | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM)
*  President Zelensky has this weekend rejected a bid by the United States for access to half a trillion dollars of mineral resources [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=0.0s)]
*  in return for further military support or security guarantees. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=7.0s)]
*  In an interview with the broadcaster NBC, Mr. Zelensky questioned whether minerals in areas currently held by Russia [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=11.0s)]
*  might be handed over to President Putin. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=18.0s)]
*  Well, Ukraine holds huge deposits of critical elements and minerals, everything from lithium to titanium. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=20.0s)]
*  It also has sizable coal deposits as well as oil, gas and uranium. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=26.0s)]
*  But much of this is in territories that are currently under Russian control. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, let's speak to Robert Munger, who's the founder of Igor Rappei, the institute. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=34.0s)]
*  He joins me now from Munich, where he's been attending that conference. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=38.0s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=41.0s)]
*  Talk to me first of all about Ukraine's position in the world mineral market. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=43.0s)]
*  What has it got and why does America want it? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=47.0s)]
*  Well, good to be with you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=50.0s)]
*  I mean, the first thing to say is that Ukraine is a critical mineral superpower. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=53.0s)]
*  It's got about 117 of the 120 minerals that are desired by countries around the world, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=57.0s)]
*  many of which are desired by the United States and the European Union, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=62.0s)]
*  and has, as you said, an abundance of hydrocarbons, oil and gas, especially coal, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=65.0s)]
*  but also things like titanium, iron, lithium, rare earths, all minerals that are highly sought after [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=70.0s)]
*  in the rush for the green transition as well as for aerospace and defense. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=77.0s)]
*  Yeah, and they're so crucial in that green transition, of course, particularly for their role in batteries. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=81.0s)]
*  We know that that is at the center of that big round between the US and China, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=86.0s)]
*  and so Ukraine probably finds itself caught between the two in terms of who has access to it, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=90.0s)]
*  because if you have access, you have power. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=95.0s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=98.0s)]
*  We estimated back in 2022 that Ukraine had something in the order of $26 trillion worth of deposits. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=100.0s)]
*  The big challenge, though, is not only are those not fully developed, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=106.0s)]
*  but about 20 to 30 percent of those back in 2022 were in Russian-occupied areas. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=110.0s)]
*  And so while Ukraine has an abundance of many of these kinds of minerals that are being sought after, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=115.0s)]
*  especially, as you say, for electric vehicles as well as for defense systems, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=120.0s)]
*  a lot of these aren't yet developed or are only partially developed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=125.0s)]
*  And that was an issue that was actually being addressed before the war started, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=129.0s)]
*  but the Russian-Ukraine war actually slowed down the options that were being planned by the European Union at the time. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=132.0s)]
*  And so is it your assessment here that these minerals are being used as a bargaining chip [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=137.0s)]
*  in terms of whether the US will support either militarily or in terms of security guarantees? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=142.0s)]
*  They say, look, give us access to these minerals, then you get our support, and without it, we won't. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=148.0s)]
*  I mean, is that what it looks like right now? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=153.0s)]
*  I would say this is a bit of a long shot for Ukraine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=156.0s)]
*  I mean, I think, first of all, there's definitely interest globally. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=159.0s)]
*  It has been interest in a variety of minerals in Ukraine for years. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=162.0s)]
*  But right now, I think what Ukraine desperately seeks is more economic entanglement with the United States, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=165.0s)]
*  especially in those areas that are occupied by Russia or those areas that are adjacent, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=170.0s)]
*  as well as security guarantees so that there's a long-term investment from the United States in Ukraine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=174.0s)]
*  But it's going to take hundreds of billions of dollars of investment to really build an industry [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=179.0s)]
*  that's going to be one that the US wants to preserve and protect. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=184.0s)]
*  So I think Ukraine is really pushing hard right now with the United States [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=187.0s)]
*  to try to come up with some kind of arrangement that provides a satisfactory solution [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=190.0s)]
*  both for its domestic constituencies, but also security guarantees [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=194.0s)]
*  in the eventual ceasefire peace deal that we're all hoping will be achieved at some point in the coming months or years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=198.0s)]
*  Robert, it's good to talk to you. Thank you. We will talk about this again, I'm sure. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=203.0s)]
*  But Robert Mugga there, thank you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig3Cjk9vyLM&t=207.0s)]
