Video Description: US President Donald Trump has said he is considering imposing a 10% tariff on imports of Chinese-made goods as soon as 1 February.
 
Trump said discussions with his administration were "based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada".
 
Trump's comments followed his threats to levy import taxes of 25% on Mexico and Canada, accusing them of allowing undocumented migrants and drugs to come into the US.
 
In a press conference in Washington on Tuesday, Trump also vowed to hit the European Union with tariffs.

# What tariffs has Trump threatened foreign nations with? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A)
*  President Donald Trump is also warning BRICS nations, that's the nine countries with leading [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=0.0s)]
*  emerging economies, that he could impose 100% tariffs on them if they are to create a rival [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=5.24s)]
*  currency to the US dollar. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=11.8s)]
*  Major world powers, China and Russia, are part of the BRICS alliance, along with Brazil, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=14.08s)]
*  India, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, India's government is looking at potentially cutting tariffs, a trade deal and importing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=25.0s)]
*  more goods from the US if President Donald Trump follows through with his trade actions. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=30.68s)]
*  During the US election, Donald Trump campaigned on implementing widespread tariffs and tariffs [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=37.64s)]
*  are a central part of President Trump's economic vision. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=43.08s)]
*  He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=47.16s)]
*  Let's find out how some of these decisions will impact other parts of the world with [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=54.36s)]
*  our correspondents Arunadeh Mukherjee in Delhi and Nikisha Ogbana in Lagos. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  I asked Arunadeh how India has been viewing the possibility of these tariffs being imposed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=64.0s)]
*  The Indian government is yet to respond officially with some sort of a reaction to the ongoing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=70.92s)]
*  developments and the possibilities of higher tariffs, but we are expecting some sort of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=77.0s)]
*  statement or at least a comment from the Ministry of External Affairs when it does host its [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=81.48s)]
*  weekly press briefing tomorrow. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  So we'll be standing by to hear what the government is really thinking. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  But in anticipation of that, this is an ongoing conversation, Katrina, as you mentioned, and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  it's been covered largely by the international as well as the local media, spearheaded by [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  that Bloomberg report, of course, which talked about some of the possibilities and scenarios [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=100.44s)]
*  that India is exploring in case this does become a reality. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=104.76s)]
*  Most importantly, according to analysts, they say India is looking to avoid any kind of a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  confrontation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=114.36s)]
*  So they're looking at ways in which they can work together to ensure that this actually is a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=115.0s)]
*  meaningful relationship going forward. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  So one of the aspects could be to lower tariffs, of course, on some of those critical goods, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=121.88s)]
*  which are sensitive to the U.S. and especially intrinsic to what has been Donald Trump's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=126.35999999999999s)]
*  political campaign as well. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=132.68s)]
*  The other aspect is, of course, working on a possible trade deal, something that was on [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=134.04s)]
*  the cards during Donald Trump's first tenure as president, but they couldn't actually it [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=138.28s)]
*  didn't materialize eventually. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=143.72s)]
*  And then the government changed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=145.56s)]
*  And finally, most importantly, to try and reduce India's imports from other countries and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=146.68s)]
*  increase India's imports from the U.S. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=151.32s)]
*  Because this remains a very important and sensitive sticking point when it comes to trade [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=153.4s)]
*  relations between India and the U.S. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=158.04s)]
*  Because there is a significant trade surplus in favor of India to the tune of about $35 [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=159.4s)]
*  billion at last check at the end of the financial year last year. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=164.76s)]
*  So India is looking for possibilities to increase those imports, which could perhaps [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=168.76s)]
*  placate the U.S. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=173.88s)]
*  The other aspect that India is also looking at very closely is how the U.S. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  goes ahead and looks at China and the kind of tariffs that are imposed there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  Because India for long has been trying to project itself as a big viable economic alternative to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=182.84s)]
*  China as relations have deteriorated between the U.S. and China. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=188.92s)]
*  So can India benefit from that and emerge as that stronger player here in the region? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=192.44000000000003s)]
*  So these are some of the aspects that India is really looking at and mulling. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=197.8s)]
*  But once again, we're waiting to hear officially what India's stand could be. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=205.8s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=206.44000000000003s)]
*  And Enkechi, President Trump is planning to withdraw from the World Health Organization, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  the U.S. being the biggest donor to the WHO. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  What will all of that mean for the programs that it runs in African nations? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=216.44000000000003s)]
*  Well, Katrina, it's very scary at this moment. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  A lot of people, especially on social media, are reacting to that news. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=227.16000000000003s)]
*  First off, African countries, over half of them, rely on external donors for over 20 percent [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=233.16000000000003s)]
*  of their health budgets. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  And so that means that international donor agencies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  the World Health Organization are key players in tackling Africa's health challenges. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=249.0s)]
*  And closely linked to that is diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=255.16s)]
*  which are some of the most prominent on the continent. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=262.52s)]
*  The efforts made and the gains made in combating these diseases could weaken in the coming months [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=267.72s)]
*  and years following this decision because of the U.S. pulling out from the World Health [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=274.84s)]
*  Organization. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=280.76s)]
*  If those funds that the WHO relies on from the U.S. as a heavy donor, about 18 percent [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=281.64s)]
*  of donations to the World Health come from the United States. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=290.76s)]
*  So African countries would be worried about what that would mean for the health structures [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=295.08s)]
*  on ground. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=302.28s)]
*  Also, the World Health Organization responded saying it hopes the U.S. would reconsider [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=303.0s)]
*  its decision and probably negotiate with key stakeholders in that sector. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=310.28s)]
*  But it also highlighted its gains in the past years, which have seen the eradication of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=316.28s)]
*  diseases like smallpox and also its current campaign on polio. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=322.84s)]
*  And just very briefly, former President Biden was criticized for his limited engagement [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=329.64s)]
*  in Africa and despite promises to visit only going there in the last weeks of his administration. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=335.88s)]
*  What is the view broadly of what U.S.-African relations might look like under Donald Trump? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=341.08s)]
*  Well, there are already existing programs like the AGOR, the agricultural program that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  some African countries are currently benefiting from. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=353.64s)]
*  So that is a program that is hoped that in the coming years, it wouldn't be suspended, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=357.32s)]
*  it would be sustained. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=362.28s)]
*  However, we're beginning to see a new scramble for Africa where other world powers like China, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=363.64s)]
*  India, and even Russia, you know, are coming to make, establish their presence and foster [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=370.84s)]
*  relationships with Africa. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=377.56s)]
*  So we hope, it is hoped that President Trump would also capitalize on this new scramble [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=379.8s)]
*  and the relationship would be better compared to his first term in office. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=387.08s)]
*  Well, we've no information yet on where President Trump's first foreign trip abroad will be, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=393.88s)]
*  but he did say last night that by the end of this week, he plans to visit North Carolina, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=399.0s)]
*  Nevada, and to go to Los Angeles, the scene of those devastating wildfires last week. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=404.2s)]
*  So we'll keep across all of those plans. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=409.56s)]
*  Back to you, Lizzie. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=412.2s)]
*  Katrina, thank you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrcnrh3t0A&t=413.16s)]
