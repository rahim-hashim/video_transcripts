Video Description: Selling sex is said to be the oldest profession in the world. But now a new take on prostitution is causing controversy. Brothels full of sex dolls are opening all over Europe. 
Clients go there and instead of paying for sex workers…they pay to spend time with incredibly realistic silicone dolls. 
In this film, Sofia Bettiza travels to Northern Italy – where Europe’s only chain of doll brothels has opened its latest establishment.

# Sex doll brothels: a growing trend?  - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 18, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ)
*  Sex dolls. They've been around for hundreds of years and more are being bought in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  UK than ever before. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=10.72s)]
*  Are you in love with your dolls? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=12.88s)]
*  You can't help but form a strange kind of bond. I look at her and I think it's illogical. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=14.68s)]
*  And sex doll brothels are popping up across Europe. Will they ever make it acceptable [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=20.8s)]
*  to choose a doll over a human? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=28.28s)]
*  The eyes look real. You can open the mouth. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=30.92s)]
*  It's just a game, a different way to express your sexuality. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=35.72s)]
*  The Italian city of Turin is famous for fashion, cars and chocolates. But a new business is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=48.64s)]
*  proving controversial. A brothel with a difference. Instead of paying for women, clients pay to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=56.04s)]
*  have sex with dolls. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=63.32s)]
*  I'm on my way to a secret location to go and see these brothels for myself. Honestly, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't really know what to expect. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=70.88s)]
*  Hello, I'm Sophia. Nice to meet you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=74.28s)]
*  In each room you find a bed, a TV, a shower. It feels really squishy. It feels like a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=84.84s)]
*  stress ball. And of course, a doll. The head turns. And glasses? Why? Why would you have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=91.92s)]
*  glasses? Oh, so she's like a sexy secretary. So the lips are so realistic and really soft. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=101.4s)]
*  The brothel owners argue this place is ethical because there's no exploitation of women [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=114.48s)]
*  and there's no risk of getting an STD. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=119.84s)]
*  Even the feet, they are manicured. So you clearly think about every detail. But then [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=123.36s)]
*  if I touch the toes, it's like, you know, it's like jelly. You can open the mouth. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  It's easy. Clients go on a website and pick a woman or a man. They can't find a girl [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=141.48s)]
*  who's not a woman. They can't find a girl who's not a man. They can't find a girl who's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=148.48s)]
*  not a man. They can't find a girl who's not a man. They can't find a girl who's not a man. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=155.48s)]
*  It's easy. Clients go on a website and pick a woman or a man. They can choose hair colour, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=162.48s)]
*  body shape or outfit. Prices start from 80 euros, which is about 70 pounds, for 30 minutes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=172.88s)]
*  I'm told most clients are young men in their 20s and 30s. Many are straight. Some are gay [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  or bi. But the owners say women and couples also visit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=189.08s)]
*  At the brothel, I meet one of Christopher's clients. He doesn't want to be identified. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=196.08s)]
*  He's tried a sex doll. It was a birthday present from his friends. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=202.96s)]
*  If you're going to pay for sex, why not pay a real person? Why pay for a doll? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  It's very different. A prostitute is a real person and can judge you for the way you look [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=216.08s)]
*  or for fantasies. You have. A doll can't do that. With a doll, all I had to think about [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=221.4s)]
*  was my own satisfaction. I felt more free. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=227.0s)]
*  You have a girlfriend. How did she feel about you coming here and having sex with a doll? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=230.96s)]
*  She found it quite funny, actually. She didn't see it as cheating. Cheating requires emotions. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=239.84s)]
*  While this was just physical, she just saw it as an opportunity for me to have fun and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=245.28s)]
*  try something out of the ordinary. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=250.56s)]
*  So if more clients are using dolls, does that mean that they'll stop going to see sex workers? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=261.68s)]
*  And how worried are they about losing their business? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=268.04s)]
*  Louis is a male escort. He says a lot of his clients, who are sexually fluid, have tried [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=275.32s)]
*  dinner by brothel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=281.56s)]
*  In the beginning we lost our customers for more than three weeks. So it was offensive [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=283.48s)]
*  for me as well. Am I useless or why? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=289.56s)]
*  So your clients all went to the brothel instead of coming to you? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  Definitely. If they are not coming to me, it means they are going to both brothels. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=297.72s)]
*  It's not only a job, it's a passion for me. And I'm just losing it slowly, slowly. So [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=303.24s)]
*  I'm worried about it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  Like in the UK, it's illegal to run brothels here. But there aren't any laws on brothels [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  with dolls. And it seems that many sex workers don't actually have a problem with them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=319.68s)]
*  Tacked away behind a car park, a photoshoot for Playboy is getting underway. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=327.32s)]
*  Are you worried about your job, your livelihoods? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  Do you find it offensive that someone who chooses to pay for sex will choose a doll [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=347.6s)]
*  over you? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=354.56s)]
*  No. It's something completely different. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=357.32s)]
*  No. A doll can never take my place. The escort offers personality, human warmth, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=360.36s)]
*  attention. A doll can never offer that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=370.36s)]
*  Do you think that sex dolls could replace sex workers? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=374.36s)]
*  No, I don't think so. But I think they could take a stand. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=378.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=384.36s)]
*  Because it's an interesting article. Because it gives many people the opportunity to express [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  themselves more freely than with their own woman. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  But some aspects are troubling. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  Kate looks like a teenager. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes, a teen. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  One of the dolls in the brothel is dressed like a schoolgirl. Many would see this as [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  a huge ethical issue. But the manager claims it's just a fantasy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  Fantasy for men. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=414.44s)]
*  Fantasy for men. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=415.44s)]
*  It's not just in Italy that people have conflicting opinions about sex dolls. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=419.44s)]
*  So I've come to London to hear from an expert. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=425.44s)]
*  I think there are ethical issues. One of the things that's quite concerning is the production [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=428.44s)]
*  of child-like sex dolls. There have been people prosecuted for this, quite a few in the last [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=432.44s)]
*  year. I think that is an area that needs a lot of regulation and we have to keep an eye [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=437.44s)]
*  on that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=441.44s)]
*  Do you think these dolls could promote the objectification of women? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=442.48s)]
*  They're an incredibly reductive stereotype of the female body. They're hypersexualised [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=445.48s)]
*  and they're pornified. I think that could be damaging. It certainly objectifies women. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=450.48s)]
*  Here in the UK, there are people using dolls in the privacy of their own homes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=457.48s)]
*  We're going to meet one man who has nine of them. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=462.48s)]
*  Can I come in? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=465.48s)]
*  Please come in. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=466.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=467.48s)]
*  When Dean got divorced and his kids moved away, he started to feel lonely. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  And so these dolls filled that void. He dresses them up, takes photos that he shares on social [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  media and has sex with some of them. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  Some people would say that this is a bit weird and a bit creepy. What do you say to that? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=484.52000000000004s)]
*  I always say, why? Why is it creepy? They say it's disgusting. Why are you wasting your [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  time? Spend time with real people. But my dolls aren't judgemental. They don't say [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=495.56s)]
*  horrible things. They wouldn't have voted for Brexit. And that's why I like them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=502.56s)]
*  Dean got his first doll because he was curious, but ended up developing a strong connection [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=511.56s)]
*  with her. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=518.56s)]
*  Do you feel like Sarah is your girlfriend? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=519.56s)]
*  She's the closest thing I've got to one. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=522.5999999999999s)]
*  And how would you feel if you started dating somebody and they wanted you to get rid of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=526.5999999999999s)]
*  your dolls? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=531.5999999999999s)]
*  If I met a woman mad enough to date me now and she said to me, you'll have to get rid [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  of Sarah. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=539.5999999999999s)]
*  Your doll? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=540.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I couldn't do it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=541.5999999999999s)]
*  She, because I'd look at her and think, well, in the last couple of years, she has given [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=544.64s)]
*  me so much and made me so happy. There's no way I'll get rid of her. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=552.64s)]
*  Sometimes I wish my dolls could talk to me, you know, and I often look at her and say, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=559.64s)]
*  say something, please, you know. It would just be that extra bit of realism. And I can [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=563.64s)]
*  see it coming in the future. And I hope I live long enough to see it because I think [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=569.68s)]
*  that would be wonderful. And it will help an awful lot of lonely people that there are [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=574.68s)]
*  in the world that just don't have the ability to maybe get out and socialise. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=578.68s)]
*  For a lot of people in the dolls, they say that it's about companionship. It's about [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=584.68s)]
*  them having a doll that they can treat with respect, like a partner. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=589.68s)]
*  The global sex toys market is expected to be worth more than 20 billion pounds in 2020. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  And these are now an important part. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  Dean uses his dolls privately, but in Italy, they've become a business. Spain, Belgium, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=607.7199999999999s)]
*  Russia, Canada are all embracing brothels filled with sex dolls. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  So, could this catch on in the UK? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTSrLHxSoAQ&t=621.72s)]
