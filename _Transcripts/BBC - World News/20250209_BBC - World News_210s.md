Video Description: A new “megaport” on Peru's coastline, that's part of China's Belt and Road initiative, has increased the frequency of its trips to Asia. 

With a direct route to China that cuts sailing times by some 10 days, the port aspires to become South America's gateway to Asia, bypassing North America entirely.
