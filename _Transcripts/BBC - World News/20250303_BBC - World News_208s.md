**BBC - World News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8)
*  Pakistan is pressing ahead with the deportation of Afghans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=0.0s)]
*  That is despite the UN warning some were registered by their refugee agency as in need of international protection. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=4.0s)]
*  930 people were sent back in the first half of February. That's double the number two weeks prior. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=11.0s)]
*  Pakistan says its policies are aimed at all illegal foreign nationals. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=17.0s)]
*  BBC News has spoken to families in hiding. We've withheld their names and identities for their safety. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=21.0s)]
*  Our Pakistan correspondent Azaday Mashiri reports from Islamabad. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=28.0s)]
*  The moment Afghans fear. Police in plain clothes, rounding them up, moving them to a place called Hajikamp, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=33.0s)]
*  where families in Islamabad and Raalpindi are being held. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=41.0s)]
*  This is footage Ahmad secretly filmed of his family and neighbours being taken there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=48.0s)]
*  He's one of several Afghans we've spoken to on a US resettlement programme that was suspended in January. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=53.0s)]
*  Ahmad worked for a Western charity and fled after the Taliban takeover. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=60.0s)]
*  When he was out shopping, he received a call. It was his daughter's voice on the line. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=64.0s)]
*  Ahmad had already received his visa extension, but his wife was still waiting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=76.0s)]
*  He decided to go with them to the camp. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=81.0s)]
*  We went to Hajikamp to verify some of the accounts we're hearing, but were denied entry. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=97.0s)]
*  Pakistan's government says there is no mistreatment. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=102.0s)]
*  Amineh was also locked out of these gates and was trying to visit her sister in the camp. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=106.0s)]
*  If my country was safe, why would I come here in Pakistan? And I can't even live here peacefully. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=114.0s)]
*  This area is home to many Afghans, which is why you'll see so much Afghan food and shops. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=121.0s)]
*  Pakistan has taken in millions over more than 40 years, and the UN says there are about 3 million Afghans in the country today. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=126.0s)]
*  But Pakistan is frustrated by what it calls very slow resettlement programmes in other countries. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=133.0s)]
*  And it says this problem can't go on forever. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=139.0s)]
*  Families like this one are terrified of what that could mean for them. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=145.0s)]
*  They aren't on any resettlement lists and don't have visas. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=148.0s)]
*  Yet, Hamid was in the Afghan military before the Taliban takeover. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=153.0s)]
*  I've served my country and now I'm useless. That job has doomed me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=158.0s)]
*  Some Afghans are choosing to return. The Taliban government has told the BBC they can all live in the country without any fear. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=166.0s)]
*  But the UN has previously cast doubt on an amnesty. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=173.0s)]
*  Hamid's family feel safer spending most of their days in their home. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=180.0s)]
*  Don't force us out. Don't kick Afghans out of their homes. We are not here by choice. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=188.0s)]
*  Many others we've spoken to also feel stranded, with no path to safety. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=197.0s)]
*  Azar Deh Mashiri, BBC News, Islamabad. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zStSdooE8y8&t=205.0s)]
