*  Let's bring you more on our breaking news now from Sweden. Police say five people have been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=0.0s)]
*  shot at a school for adults in the centre of the country, the shooting happening in Orebro. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=4.4s)]
*  That's about 200 kilometres west of Stockholm on Tuesday afternoon. We still don't know the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=9.68s)]
*  extent of the injuries, that's unclear, but police are urging people to stay away from the school. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=14.88s)]
*  So let's speak now to Emma Lofgren who is editor at The Local which is an English-language Swedish [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=20.64s)]
*  news outlet. Emma, thank you for joining us on what must be a very shocking day for people in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=26.16s)]
*  your city, but what are you hearing from in and around the school? What's the latest from the police? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=31.2s)]
*  Well what you said in the intro kind of sums up what we do know at the moment. We know that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=37.2s)]
*  there's been a shooting this afternoon at school in Orebro. We don't know the state of the injuries [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=41.92s)]
*  of the five people who have been shot. There have been unconfirmed reports from the Swedish media [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=47.68s)]
*  saying that the perpetrator has taken their own life. That has not been confirmed by police yet. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=53.44s)]
*  There have also been reports that shots were fired at police. The police has confirmed that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=58.8s)]
*  no officer has been injured. Police are still urging people to stay away from the area, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=63.44s)]
*  at least to let them work in peace. And Emma, was this a school for adults? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=68.8s)]
*  This was a school for adult education, yes. So that includes everything from adults who need to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=74.96s)]
*  you know catch up on a high school degree that they haven't done yet to you know immigrants [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  studying Swedish for immigrants. One teacher told Swedish media that there were fewer students than [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  normal at the school today because there had just been an exam and a lot of people had left after [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=95.68s)]
*  that. But what we're hearing is that people are still being told to stay inside, particularly at [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  local schools and other places around that area. This is still sort of an act of such a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=105.92s)]
*  situation for the police? This is still very much an active situation for the police. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=111.52s)]
*  At around a quarter past 2 pm, that's Swedish time, so that's an hour ahead of the Greenwich [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=116.16s)]
*  meantime, police were saying that the danger is not over. I think my impression is that it's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=122.16s)]
*  starting to calm down a little bit by now and by now police are urging people to stay inside mostly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=127.84s)]
*  because they want to be allowed to investigate without any disturbance. Emma, I'm seeing on [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=133.28s)]
*  social media there is a real sense of shock about what has happened but can you explain to us just [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=138.88s)]
*  how unusual this kind of thing is in Sweden? Yes absolutely, I mean it's very unusual. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=143.84s)]
*  School attacks in general are quite unusual in Sweden and shootings at schools even more so. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=149.68s)]
*  I think there is a small risk that I could be wrong but off the top of my head I think the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=156.16s)]
*  last school shooting, at least the last fatal one in Sweden, was in the 1960s. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=160.56s)]
*  And in Oribro itself is it usually considered to be a very safe and friendly place? I know there's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=166.08s)]
*  not a big population but you have a university there, it's a small town, tell us about it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=171.76s)]
*  It's a lovely town, there are about 120,000 people who live there I think. It's a fairly ordinary [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=177.76s)]
*  Swedish town, you know it's generally safe like most of Sweden, it's got certain areas that are [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=185.44s)]
*  maybe not as friendly as others but in general it's a safe nice place. Emma, thank you for updating us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9d7gFW3ls&t=190.96s)]
