Video Description: US President Donald Trump says he is "strongly considering" large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and a peace agreement is reached.
 
It comes after Russia carried out an overnight attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which injured at least 18 people according to Ukrainian officials.
 
Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, have already imposed more than 21,000 sanctions on Russia.
