*  anything. The authorities, obviously they're assessing the causes of the collapse of the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCT0GDaSMc&t=34.88s)]
*  roof, but they are concentrating on trying to rescue as many survivors as they can. As you said, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCT0GDaSMc&t=40.64s)]

*  a long career. He was 69 years old. And just in terms of updates, because obviously there's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjCT0GDaSMc&t=150.24s)]
