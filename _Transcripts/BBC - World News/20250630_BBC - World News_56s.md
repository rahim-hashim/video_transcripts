*  Two US firefighters in Idaho have been killed after a man intentionally started a fire and began shooting at them when they came to help. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR33WALiyUI&t=0.0s)]
*  Authorities say it was a total ambush which lasted several hours, with the gunman using a high-powered sporting rifle to fire rapidly. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR33WALiyUI&t=7.12s)]
*  A third firefighter was wounded at the scene on Sunday afternoon and was fighting for his life but is in stable condition. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR33WALiyUI&t=14.4s)]
*  Police say the gunman acted alone and firefighters received the first report of a fire on Canfield Mountain at around 1.21 in the afternoon local time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR33WALiyUI&t=20.28s)]
*  Just about 40 minutes later there were reports that firefighters were being shot at. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR33WALiyUI&t=29.04s)]

*  After an hour-long barrage of gunfire, a SWAT team located at a ceased mail, close to where the attack took place. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR33WALiyUI&t=40.2s)]
*  It was unclear whether the suspect killed himself or was hit by an officer, Sheriff Bob Norris said. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR33WALiyUI&t=46.6s)]
