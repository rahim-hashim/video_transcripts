# Venezuela crisis: Is Maduro or Guaidó in charge? - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 25, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s)
*  So who is Venezuela's leader? Is it Nicolás Maduro, the man who's ruled since the death [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=0.0s)]
*  of Hugo Chávez six years ago? Or is it the opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who declared [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=8.28s)]
*  himself caretaker president and swore to end what he calls a dictatorship? The United States [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=13.16s)]
*  and Canada were quick to back Mr. Guaidó, along with Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=18.68s)]
*  It all comes as Venezuela's long political and economic crisis grinds on. The economy [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=24.8s)]
*  is in free fall. In recent years, millions of Venezuelans have given up hope and left [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  the country. With huge crowds on the streets of Caracas, this all feels like the most serious [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=36.0s)]
*  threat Mr. Maduro has ever faced. Of course, he has been through some of this before. There [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=42.24s)]
*  were months of street protests in 2014 and again in 2017, each time the authorities cracked [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  down. Thousands were arrested and scores killed. But the pressures which drove people onto [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=53.88s)]
*  the streets before have all got worse. The shortages, the hyperinflation, the sense that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=60.0s)]
*  Venezuela is falling apart. The other difference is the international reaction. America has [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=65.04s)]
*  warned the authorities that all options are on the table if they resort to violence. Canada [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=71.36s)]
*  says the Maduro government is now a dictatorship and the EU is calling for the start of a political [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=77.04s)]
*  process that leads to free and credible elections. Russia has accused the West of gross interference [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=82.78s)]
*  and of course, a long history of US involvement in Latin America may mean that Washington [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=90.06s)]
*  has to tread carefully. Will Mr. Maduro simply tough it out again as he has before? All eyes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=94.8s)]
*  are on the military. If they remain loyal, then another bloody crackdown is likely. If [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=100.86s)]
*  they follow Juan Guaidó, then Mr. Maduro's days are numbered. And if they're divided, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=105.68s)]
*  then Venezuela's crisis could get a whole lot worse. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFJzSSON5s&t=111.94s)]
