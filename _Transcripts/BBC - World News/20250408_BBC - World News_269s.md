**BBC - World News:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ)
*  Hello, I'm Geetha Gurumuthi. Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We're starting this hour with some breaking news. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=2.6s)]
*  Ukraine is claiming its forces have captured two Chinese [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=4.96s)]
*  nationals fighting as part of the Russian army. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=8.28s)]
*  President Zelensky has said that they had ID and bank cards [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=11.28s)]
*  on them when they were captured in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=15.24s)]
*  region. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=18.12s)]
*  And he added that we have information indicating [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=18.92s)]
*  that the number of such Chinese citizens fighting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=21.76s)]
*  in the occupiers units is much higher than two. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=24.12s)]
*  Those were his words and he's instructed Ukraine's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=28.04s)]
*  foreign minister to contact Beijing for some reaction. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=30.52s)]
*  Well, earlier Russia had used thousands of North Korean troops [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  to try to push Ukrainian forces out of the Kursk region. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=37.8s)]
*  Let's speak to our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=42.2s)]
*  in Kiev. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=45.24s)]
*  James, just tell us more about these claims. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=45.84s)]
*  Very little that we know at the moment. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=50.96s)]
*  As you say, President Zelensky has posted a video online [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=52.56s)]
*  appearing to show a soldier, an Asian soldier, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=56.04s)]
*  in a Russian uniform gesticulating [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=61.24s)]
*  to his Ukrainian captors. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=64.12s)]
*  You can hear him say, my commander, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=66.6s)]
*  before making a symbol of a gun with his hands, which [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=69.16s)]
*  are in handcuffs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  And President Zelensky is making the accusation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=74.24s)]
*  that Chinese citizens are fighting for Russian forces [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=78.08s)]
*  in eastern Ukraine. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=82.6s)]
*  As I say, there's a lot we don't know. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=84.76s)]
*  We don't know if they are indeed Chinese, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=86.2s)]
*  whether they're fighting in Ukraine as mercenaries. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=89.0s)]
*  There are thousands of mercenaries [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  fighting in this war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=93.36s)]
*  Or whether they are Chinese citizens [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=94.68s)]
*  who have been living in Russia and who were simply mobilized [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=96.56s)]
*  to join Moscow's invasion. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=99.48s)]
*  But if you are President Zelensky, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=102.2s)]
*  you try to portray the expanding geopolitical footprint [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=104.4s)]
*  of this war to try and provoke the West [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=109.92s)]
*  into a deeper response against a growing coalition. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=113.0s)]
*  And when it comes to China and Russia, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=116.84s)]
*  before the full scale invasion, they [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=119.0s)]
*  talked about a relationship with no limits [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=120.44s)]
*  against external threats. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=123.36s)]
*  What they meant was America. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=124.92s)]
*  Their economic ties have deepened. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  China is the major importer now to Russia. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=129.32s)]
*  And Western officials have always [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=133.56s)]
*  been fearful of its technology making its way [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=135.68s)]
*  into the missiles and military technology used [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=138.76s)]
*  to fight against Ukrainian troops [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=141.04s)]
*  or to terrorize Ukrainian cities. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  So this is certainly a development, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=144.72s)]
*  if you look at the accusation President Zelensky is making. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  But there's a lot of detail missing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=151.84s)]
*  as to what extent Beijing could be involved [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=153.6s)]
*  in a military sense. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=156.92s)]
*  What would be the significance if it is indeed true? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, then you have a scenario where you have not one, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=165.76s)]
*  but two of the world's major powers helping each other [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=169.2s)]
*  in the continued invasion of a sovereign European country [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=174.0s)]
*  where its traditional Western counterpart, America, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=177.56s)]
*  as of now is less interested in supporting Ukraine [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  in the long term. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=186.48s)]
*  Now, the Trump administration has said [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=187.56s)]
*  it is prioritizing China as part of its foreign policy [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=189.88s)]
*  going forward in terms of its potential aggression [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=193.64s)]
*  towards Taiwan or other ambitions and balances of power. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=196.24s)]
*  And so if it is proved, and it's not been yet, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=201.44s)]
*  if it is proved that China is directly helping [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=204.84s)]
*  Moscow in a military sense, it's thought in some expert corners [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  that it is, but there's certainly [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=211.4s)]
*  a deepening relationship there, then President Zelensky [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=213.56s)]
*  will pose the direct question as to what the West, America, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=216.36s)]
*  is going to do to counteract this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=220.56s)]
*  But we are only talking about two soldiers [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=223.8s)]
*  which have been captured so far. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  As you say, there are 12,000, thought [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=228.64s)]
*  to be 12,000 North Korean soldiers who've [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=230.88s)]
*  fought in other parts of the front line. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=232.88s)]
*  In a military sense, they made very little difference, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=236.48s)]
*  but it's what it could turn into, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=240.04s)]
*  which is so significant for Ukraine, not just [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  the soldiers fighting, but the weapons and ammunition [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=244.27999999999997s)]
*  that the likes of North Korea and possibly China, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=247.32s)]
*  but we don't know, could provide to Russia. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  A lot of unknown questions at the moment, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=252.83999999999997s)]
*  but I think the sight of a Chinese citizen being captured, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=255.16s)]
*  fighting for Russia, says a lot in itself. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=259.04s)]
*  Yeah, we obviously have to wait for this to be verified. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=262.44s)]
*  James Waterhouse in Ukraine, in Kyiv, thank you so much. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8BTxuXSFKQ&t=265.84s)]
