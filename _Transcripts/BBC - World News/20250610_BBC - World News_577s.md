# Curfew begins in LA as California governor attacks Trump for 'inflaming' protests | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ)
*  We start Newsday in the United States where a curfew has just come into effect in downtown LA as protests over immigration raids [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Continue for a fifth day in the last hour California governor Gavin Newsom has said he doesn't want the streets of his state [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=7.62s)]
*  Militarized by the country's armed forces it comes as the federal government has sent National Guard and Marines to quell the protests [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that those troops will be providing protection for immigration agents during raids [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=21.38s)]
*  Now here's part of a governing governor Newsom's had to say a moments ago [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=28.48s)]
*  Like many states, California is no stranger to this sort of unrest [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=33.8s)]
*  We manage it regularly and with our own law enforcement, but this again was different [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=39.04s)]
*  What then ensued was a use of tear gas flashbang grenades rubber bullets federal agents [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=45.6s)]
*  Detaining people in undermining their due process rights [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=52.84s)]
*  Donald Trump without consulting California law enforcement leaders [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=56.86s)]
*  commandeered [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=62.3s)]
*  2,000 of our state's National Guard members to deploy on our streets illegally and for no reason [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=63.6s)]
*  This brazen abuse of power by a sitting president inflamed a combustible situation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=69.94s)]
*  Putting our people our officers and even our National Guard at risk [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=75.78s)]
*  That's when the downward spiral began he doubled down on his dangerous National Guard deployment by fanning the flames [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=80.84s)]
*  Even harder and the president he did it on purpose [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=88.56s)]
*  Let's go live now to Los Angeles where our correspondent Carla announcement is following this story for us [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=93.2s)]
*  Carly a curfew went into effect a few minutes ago. Tell us what the situation is like where you are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's an 8 p.m. Curfew [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=103.4s)]
*  So we're about a couple minutes into it now [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=105.4s)]
*  We are in that zone where there are severe restrictions in place if you're out on the streets [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=107.4s)]
*  You would be subject to arrest for most people in this area and you can take a look behind me [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  There is a very big line of of police officers here. This is California Highway Patrol [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=116.56s)]
*  You can see those batons at the ready and what we've been told is that they're now ready to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  Any moment now begin to march forward and clear the streets here of anybody who's still in the way [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  The mayor was stressing was that this is a small area. This is about a one square mile zone of downtown [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=131.88s)]
*  Los Angeles, of course, which is already a small area of the city. So [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=137.88s)]
*  Emphasizing, you know, this isn't martial law. This isn't something where no one will be out on the streets in the entire city [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=141.56s)]
*  But yes, you can see taking this very seriously here a large police presence and most of those demonstrators that we've seen [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=147.56s)]
*  Even in pockets even in small gatherings throughout the day have now dissipated and there's very few people left in the streets [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=155.4s)]
*  It's just media right now. We do have an exception to be out here [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=161.4s)]
*  I'm just going to look down that way and very empty streets there as well [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  So we're going to be waiting here see that we want to just see how this curfew does go into effect [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  What kind of reaction it gets from anyone that is left out in the streets? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=173.24s)]
*  But this is something that we're going to be seeing in the streets. We're going to be seeing a lot of people [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=177.24s)]
*  That is left out in the streets [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=182.52s)]
*  But this is something that was announced by the mayor of Los Angeles earlier on today [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=183.96s)]
*  And this is clearly an attempt to try to gain control of the situation [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=188.28s)]
*  Especially as you can tell we're only a few minutes away from sunset [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=193.0s)]
*  And that's when we've seen some of those troublemakers really come out and start to wreak a bit of havoc across the city [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  Kyle you've been out on the streets for us for the last few days [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Just remind us of how events have unfolded and and indeed escalated over the last few days that have now culminated and led [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  To this application of a curfew [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=210.44s)]
*  What was interesting because earlier we saw a mirror image or something that we saw on Sunday night [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=215.8s)]
*  But that was a group of protesters making their way down onto the freeway [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=219.56s)]
*  Which passes right through downtown Los Angeles the 101 freeway [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=223.72s)]
*  They briefly again blocked traffic on on both directions until police were able to get down there [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  Usher them away. Luckily nobody was hurt that could be a dangerous situation [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  But you know we saw these very chaotic scenes on Sunday where protesters managed to occupy parts of the freeway for about an hour [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  It took a lot of effort from police to get them out of there several arrests were made then [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=245.56s)]
*  67 people arrested just in that incident today [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  And these are the kinds of scenes obviously that they want to avoid here and try to get [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  Visual control over the city. They don't want any more scenes playing out and I think there's a bit of a messaging battle here, too [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  We saw two different [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=265.24s)]
*  Addresses by two leaders of California the mayor of Los Angeles and then the governor of California [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=266.68s)]
*  Denouncing the actions by president trump and then we've heard president trump saying that if he wants to see law and order in the city [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  And he believes that his actions of deputizing and sending in national guard troops as well as beginning to send in hundreds of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=278.36s)]
*  Active duty marines. He thinks that those actions helped to uh to start to calm things down [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=285.16s)]
*  But it definitely seems like right now [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  This is the biggest action we've seen from the local officials here to really gain the upper hand and again [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=291.4s)]
*  We're waiting and watching as this line of california highway patrol officers stands by and we'll see if they begin to move in and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  There's likely similar scenes playing out in different areas different boundaries of where this curfew is set again a one [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=304.76s)]
*  Mile radius in downtown los angeles actually see if just before I let you go I could tell you [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=312.28s)]
*  Can you can you see that right there? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=318.2s)]
*  We're getting a cell phone alert [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=320.52s)]
*  And this is telling everybody in the area [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=322.92s)]
*  It's a public safety alert saying that the city of los angeles has declared a curfew [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=324.68s)]
*  It's now officially in place from 8 pm to 6 pm [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=329.24s)]
*  So everybody in this area right now getting that text message for people to know that it's now a curfew zone [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  Carl thanks very much for getting us up to speed with those latest details now that the curfew has been [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=338.36s)]
*  Put into place carl nassman there on the streets of los angeles [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=343.08s)]
*  And us president donald trump says the approved protests in downtown la against immigration raids are an assault on peace in public order [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=346.62s)]
*  During a visit to north carolina the president doubled down on deploying more national guard troops and marines to the city [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  As long as we have the military there [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=362.62s)]
*  The protests won't mean anything last night if we weren't there they would have burned down the city [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=365.26000000000005s)]
*  But they did not a lot of damage other than they broke up a lot of concrete looking for weapons, you know [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=370.86s)]
*  Those are weapons [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=376.38s)]
*  If that hits somebody in the head the person's dead, you know that right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=377.82s)]
*  Are you planning? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=381.58s)]
*  Or the military will be very heavy force that's i'm very proud to tell you that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  They might as well turn around they're wasting their time [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=389.5s)]
*  Some of them will end up in jail for a long period of time [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=392.62s)]
*  And joining us for more on this from la to discuss the legal implications of deploying the u.s [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=395.34s)]
*  Military to the streets of the city is jody david armor a professor of law at university of southern california [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=401.73999999999995s)]
*  Jody, thanks very much for your time today now. We heard earlier from governor gavin newson criticizing president trump [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  He called his actions a brazen abuse of power [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=413.73999999999995s)]
*  Is he right or is there a legal reasoning for the trump administration to deploy a military to the streets of la? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=416.53999999999996s)]
*  Okay [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=421.98s)]
*  Well, frankly there is uh quite a bit of precedent that gives a president the power [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=423.26s)]
*  To invoke for example the insurrection act it was done. Uh, for example in 1957 [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=429.42s)]
*  The um local authorities governor and others did not want to integrate schools did not want black children [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=437.5s)]
*  Coming into the schools dwight eisenhower [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=445.18s)]
*  Eisenhower [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=447.52s)]
*  Federalized the national guard told them to stand down and stop interfering with black kids making it to the schools [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=448.78s)]
*  And then he sent troops in to walk those black girls and boys into those schools and sit them in the seats [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=454.56s)]
*  And that happened also in the south and places like um alabama and mississippi in the early 60s [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=460.4s)]
*  So there is precedent for what he's doing and you know, his position would be I have a national mandate [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=466.64s)]
*  And here are some local authorities who are refusing to robustly enforce my national mandate [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=473.04s)]
*  and so just like back there in 1957 when eisenhower had to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=479.52s)]
*  Federalize the national guards and make sure that the local authorities conform to his wishes and will the national mandate [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=484.94s)]
*  I'm just doing the same kind of thing [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  So he's going to he's going to try to spin the narrative for sure that way [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=493.44s)]
*  But the circumstances are incredibly different in this aspect, aren't they? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=496.72s)]
*  Well, yeah, yeah, you know there you had [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=500.0s)]
*  Somebody trying to promote and protect values of equality [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=503.44s)]
*  Right and saying that there was a national consensus that black citizens should be treated equally with white citizens [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  And we will send in federal troops to enforce that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot there's not that clear consensus on the values that trump is trying to promote or vindicate [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=517.76s)]
*  by bringing in the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  In the agents rather than allowing the process of protest the normal process of protest and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=526.08s)]
*  You know free speech to run its course as it has been in many other instances without the federal officers coming in [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  Well curfew has now been put into place in your view. Is that the right course of action for local authorities to take? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=540.64s)]
*  Well, a lot of local authorities are going to err on the side of safety [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=547.2800000000001s)]
*  And too often civil liberties are sacrificed [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=552.08s)]
*  for the sake of safety and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=556.64s)]
*  So i'm sure that local authorities are going that route [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=560.08s)]
*  But they have to recognize a lot of ordinary citizens think just as important as safety are their rights to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=563.36s)]
*  Have freedom of movement and not feel like they're in a paramilitary kind of situation [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuQi_B4IDQ&t=570.48s)]
