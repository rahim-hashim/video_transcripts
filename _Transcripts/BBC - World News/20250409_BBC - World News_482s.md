# China imposes 84% tariffs on the US | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro)
*  Well, we're just getting some breaking news here actually. The finance ministry has just made an announcement that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=0.0s)]
*  that remember there were 34 percent tariffs on all US goods coming into China. That's now been increased to 84 percent. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=6.62s)]
*  An 84 percent hit on all US goods coming into China. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, that's a clear blow to every US company wanting to sell into this huge market. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  No doubt it's going to send more shockwaves through, I would imagine, the markets, especially in the US. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=26.419999999999998s)]
*  But like I say, especially hurting any American company wanting to sell into this market. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  There may well be other measures. The other thing that was mentioned in that statement is that Beijing is taking the Trump administration to the WTO. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=39.379999999999995s)]
*  We sort of knew that before, though, the World Trade Organization. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=48.18s)]
*  But there may be more measures to come. That's just been flashed right now, as I say. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=51.9s)]
*  So, you know, it's on. There's no backing down from the Chinese government. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=57.82s)]
*  They said there would be resolute countermeasures if Donald Trump made good on his promise to increase the US tariff on Chinese goods to a minimum of 104 percent. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=62.3s)]
*  And so we're seeing that. We're seeing the beginnings of that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=75.34s)]
*  Now, you know, what's Donald Trump going to do in the face of yet another increase from here? Where does it stop? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=78.86s)]
*  I mean, the Chinese government, for example, has been saying over the last couple of days that from its point of view, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=84.58s)]
*  the Trump administration has shown no inclination whatsoever to enter into negotiations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=91.3s)]
*  Today, via its sort of proxies, I suppose, state media reporters on their social media platforms, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=97.7s)]
*  it's been kind of ridiculing the fact that other countries are going with the begging bowl to Washington and saying, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=105.14s)]
*  oh, please, Donald Trump, can you take these tariffs off us? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=111.38s)]
*  They're saying this is playing right into Donald Trump's hands, that actually he wants to pick off countries one by one. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  And the contrast that's being made here is that Beijing says it supports multilateral trade efforts whereby rules apply to everybody. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=122.82s)]
*  And, you know, there would be some sympathy for that, especially in Southeast Asian countries, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=132.33999999999997s)]
*  developing countries like Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=137.7s)]
*  They've been hit very hard by tariffs from the US. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=140.26s)]
*  And funnily enough, in a meeting today, Xi Jinping said that China has to increase its trade with, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  guess where, its neighbouring countries, those very same countries. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=150.42s)]
*  So you can see that they're trying to make something good out of the trade chaos that's coming, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=154.42s)]
*  you know, from this onslaught from the Trump administration. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=159.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that news literally coming into you as we asked you that question, Stephen, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=163.54s)]
*  we're just going to keep you there for a second, but show you the DAX, the German index there, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=168.1s)]
*  because you can see on the screen as that news just came in a steep drop there in the German markets. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=172.9s)]
*  And we're hearing on the Reuters news agency that US stock index futures have turned sharply lower [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=181.22s)]
*  after China announced those additional tariff measures on US goods. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=189.3s)]
*  So, of course, this is a fast moving story. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=195.46s)]
*  Stephen, just to remind our viewers really of the scale of this, how important is US-China trade? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=200.58s)]
*  So much of what people use in both countries comes from the other. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=207.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's absolutely enormous. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=213.22000000000003s)]
*  And you can imagine why such an announcement would, you know, end up in causing such huge drop offs [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=215.3s)]
*  in stocks, even in other countries, because you've got the global superpowers at each other's throats, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=223.94s)]
*  enormous volumes of trade from one country to another. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  And remember, they're both building things with components that come from each other's countries. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=233.22000000000003s)]
*  And so if you're putting a tariff on one country, you're also hurting your own manufacturing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=239.54s)]
*  So, you know, all these American companies, Donald Trump says, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=246.98s)]
*  no worries, people are going to buy American. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=250.34s)]
*  Well, those cars and what have you, they're still using widgets that are possibly coming out of China. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=252.18s)]
*  They've got to pay more for that now the car producers. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=257.7s)]
*  And so this is why the ripples are being felt all over the world. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=260.9s)]
*  And it's why the shock of yet another announcement from China responding yet again to more tariffs [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=265.14s)]
*  from Donald Trump would be causing so much angst, especially when it comes to analysts, economists. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=271.78s)]
*  They're saying this is all disastrous for the global economy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=278.9s)]
*  Yes, Stephen, we're still getting more information from China's Commerce Ministry. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  And I appreciate you've been talking to me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=286.34s)]
*  So you've been unable to see this, but I'm just going to read out what we've got in front of us. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=288.18s)]
*  Says that the Commerce Ministry has added six US entities to the unreliable entity list and also says [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=292.26s)]
*  the Commerce Ministry has added 12 US entities to the export control list. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=300.34s)]
*  Of course, I appreciate I'm just throwing this at you now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=306.9s)]
*  But if there's anything you can read into that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, this is what happened last time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=313.62s)]
*  You know, this is the combination of last time that 34% was whacked on all US goods. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=315.3s)]
*  There was also an extra bunch of companies added to this unreliable trading list. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=321.7s)]
*  Now, normally that's someone who is either doing some sort of trade that involves Taiwan or Hong [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=327.94s)]
*  Kong or something that's upset Beijing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=334.02s)]
*  And so they're using that as an excuse to whack these companies onto those lists. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=336.26s)]
*  And basically that blocks you from trading here. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=342.26s)]
*  And, you know, it could see people involved in that being sanctioned by Beijing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=346.18s)]
*  If they try to do some sort of trading with China. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=351.46s)]
*  But you know what China has done though, because it hasn't, you know, there's more [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  Chinese trade going into the US than the other way. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  So what's Beijing going to do? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=364.18s)]
*  It can't exactly match the overall hit on tariffs. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  So it'll cherry pick things that it decides might really hurt the US, especially hurt [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=372.02s)]
*  into Donald Trump's heartland. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=380.18s)]
*  That's why they struck last time at the agricultural sector. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=381.7s)]
*  And it might happen again. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=387.06s)]
*  We could see more moves that they've flagged in social media this week via [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  state media reporters that that could be something else the Chinese government might consider. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=393.7s)]
*  Yet more moves to block agricultural products now so far, unless I'm not seeing that, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=397.94s)]
*  but it doesn't seem to have come out so far as part of these latest moves announced tonight. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=403.54s)]
*  But that could be something we see down the road. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=408.26s)]
*  So China has more options. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=410.5s)]
*  If Donald Trump ups the ante again, applies even more tariffs on top of the minimum 104% [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  on all Chinese goods, well, they've still got other weapons they can use. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=420.5s)]
*  And I should add, the difference with China and other countries is this is a big, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=424.9s)]
*  you know, resolute economy with a huge domestic market. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  And so the government here has been saying we can ride this out. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=435.54s)]
*  Certainly, that's so much more true than other countries. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=439.06s)]
*  You know, I mentioned these Southeast Asian countries that are going to be [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=442.18s)]
*  very badly hit by these tariffs. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=444.98s)]
*  It makes it so much harder for Washington to be bullying Beijing [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=447.06s)]
*  because of the power of this economy. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=451.86s)]
*  And, you know, you can imagine other countries looking at Beijing, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=454.42s)]
*  taking a stance against the Trump administration. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=457.86s)]
*  And actually, they'd be calculating they might be getting some sort of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=460.5s)]
*  political support from certain areas, you know, by virtue of the fact that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=464.5s)]
*  they're standing up to the US on this. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=469.54s)]
*  And that might even lead to greater trade with other countries, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=471.46s)]
*  which making up for the loss for Chinese companies that not selling in the same volumes into the US. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLSIklQSMro&t=475.38s)]
