Video Description: Thousands of former workers who have been freed from telecom fraud centres on the Thai-Myanmar border are now stranded in makeshift camps.
 
The labourers - from countries around the world - were lured to these centres by fake promises of good jobs.
 
The armed militia groups who are now holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.
 
The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the people are in poor health.

# Thousands stranded after being freed from Myanmar's scam centres | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ)
*  Thousands of forced labourers who've been released from scam centres along the Thai-Myanmar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  border are stranded in makeshift camps in Myanmar. Some report lowed food supplies and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=5.16s)]
*  poor sanitation. Our correspondent Jonathan Head is in Thailand. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=10.76s)]
*  The buildings you can see behind me, those white buildings there, that's one of we think [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=15.4s)]
*  around maybe up to 30 scam compounds that have been constructed along this border, right [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=19.36s)]
*  along it for a long distance over the last few years, built by Chinese gambling syndicates [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=24.44s)]
*  in them they have been carrying out elaborate fraud where they persuade people all over [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=29.68s)]
*  the world to part with their savings and they use labour, basically people who've been lured [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=34.6s)]
*  here again from all over the world, they need all kinds of languages to do it and those [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=39.96s)]
*  people in many cases have been tricked and then forced using torture and beatings to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  keep going. It's a notorious business, it's deeply involved in other areas of transnational [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=50.8s)]
*  In the last couple of weeks the Thai authorities, the Thai government here has decided it's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=56.6s)]
*  had enough. It's cut power, it's cut telecoms and that has forced the militias who control [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=61.24s)]
*  that part of Myanmar and they were in on the scams and helping them, they've now decided [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  because they're being hurt so badly by their severing of ties with Thailand to start releasing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=70.36s)]
*  the workers. So around 8,000 have been freed from these scam centres. The one behind me [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=75.0s)]
*  is called Wanye, we believe that most of the workers have been taken out of that. But the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=79.6s)]
*  problem is their only way out is through Thailand. Thailand has to process them, that's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=83.78s)]
*  a very slow process and in the meantime these people are stuck in makeshift camps over the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=87.7s)]
*  border in deteriorating conditions. The frenzy of construction has now stopped. The rows [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=92.9s)]
*  of featureless buildings which have sprung up along the Mui River are now being emptied [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=102.34s)]
*  of their workers. Many have been trafficked and horribly mistreated. When asked nearly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=107.62s)]
*  all want to go home. Last month Thailand cut fuel and power to the scam compounds forcing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=116.54s)]
*  their militia allies to start freeing the workers. This group was pushed over the narrow [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=123.06s)]
*  river on a raft and taken in by the Thai army. Hundreds of Chinese workers have already been [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  flown home, though they were clearly being treated as criminals not victims. But the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=135.58s)]
*  flow of evacuees to Thailand has now stopped. I spoke to Mike, an Ethiopian stranded in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=142.66000000000003s)]
*  Myanmar with 400 others who've escaped. The conditions we are in is very hard. We are [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=150.66000000000003s)]
*  sleeping on the floor. The toilets are very messed up by now. I just want to go home. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=157.66000000000003s)]
*  I just want to go back to my country. That is all I'm asking. For years Thailand has [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=163.98s)]
*  been accused of doing too little to stop compounds like the one behind me from running their [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=169.66s)]
*  fraud and human trafficking scams. Well, now Thailand has started to act forcing the armed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  militias over the border to free thousands of trapped workers. Yet it seems no one has [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=181.33999999999997s)]
*  thought through how to move so many people from so many countries back here to safety [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=186.82s)]
*  and back to their own homes. For the moment Thailand is reluctant to bring over more if [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=192.42s)]
*  their own governments aren't ready to fly them home. Unfortunately we are hearing distressing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=197.82s)]
*  information about lack of sanitations and toilets. Many of them were actually screened [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=205.38s)]
*  for TB and were positive for TB. We're hearing from them that they're coughing, that they're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=211.06s)]
*  coughing up blood. Our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough and these people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=215.66s)]
*  are actually basically suffering while they're waiting. You see there is many, many army [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=221.26s)]
*  also in this area so if they will find me. It's very dangerous. We met Ariane, a young [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=226.98s)]
*  Bangladeshi man who escaped from a notorious compound last October. He's come back to try [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  to free 17 friends who are still there. He describes a brutal regime with frequent electric [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=239.44s)]
*  shock torture. Their rule is very hard. They have the target every week $5,000. If no, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=247.0s)]
*  give to electric shock. To electric shocks? Every week we need to earn for them $5,000. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=254.44s)]
*  How many people did you scam in the three months you were there? Many people. I don't [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=262.26s)]
*  count. Like 20, 50? Or more than. 100? Yeah, 100. Even now there are 30,000 people who [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=269.04s)]
*  still working under duress in these compounds stretching right along this border. The civil [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=277.16s)]
*  war in Myanmar has ignited an epidemic of transnational crime which is proving difficult [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=283.12s)]
*  to control. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxysyPoOzQ&t=289.48s)]
