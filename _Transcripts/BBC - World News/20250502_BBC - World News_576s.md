# Why cost of living is a major issue in Australia election | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg)
*  In Australia, voters will head to the ballot box on Saturday to cast their vote in the country's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=0.0s)]
*  federal election. Among the critical issues for voters is the high cost of living. Both Prime [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=5.12s)]
*  Minister Anthony Albanese and the opposition leader Peter Dutton have been making big spending [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=10.08s)]
*  promises. My colleague Steve Lye is in Sydney and told us earlier what the mood is like. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  It's just about 6.10 in the evening here, the day before polling day, although early polling has [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=22.0s)]
*  been available to Australians here for the last two weeks or so. We understand that about 6 million [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=28.0s)]
*  people have already cast their votes. That's out of 18 million eligible voters. So quite a sizable [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=32.96s)]
*  proportion of the electorate have already cast their votes even before polling day has yet to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=38.24s)]
*  begin. You mentioned housing affordability and the cost of living very much on the minds of many of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=42.8s)]
*  the electorate. Worth to note as well that the demographics of this election are certainly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=47.84s)]
*  interesting because it's the first time that millennials and Gen Z voters will be outnumbering [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=53.2s)]
*  baby boomers, comprising approximately 47% of the electorate. So what matters to young people in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=59.2s)]
*  this election is something that will be on the minds of those political candidates as they've [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  been making their campaign speeches and campaign pledges as well. Now we talked a bit about the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=70.08s)]
*  cost of living and housing being on the minds of voters, but that's not the only thing. There's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=74.88s)]
*  also the geopolitics, geopolitical side of things as well that has really sort of come to the fore. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=79.28s)]
*  So it's not just the Russia-Ukraine war. It's not just what's been happening in the Middle East that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=84.0s)]
*  we've just been reporting on, but it's really U.S. President Donald Trump and his tariffs agenda that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=88.88s)]
*  has really shaken things up. We've seen how it's played out in the Canadian election. Will it have [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=93.52s)]
*  an impact here in Australia as well? That's something that candidates are trying to assess [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=98.64s)]
*  and determine what Australia's place in the world is going to be and how they present that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=104.16s)]
*  to the electorate is certainly going to be on their minds. My colleague Katie Watson [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=107.92s)]
*  has been speaking to voters from across Australia to get their thoughts on what matters to them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=111.44s)]
*  Welcome to the Wild West. Well, not quite. This is Western Sydney and Australians here are enjoying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=119.28s)]
*  some Americana. Politics here has been a bit of a wild ride. Every day, candidates trying to control [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=126.8s)]
*  their message, but not always successfully. One thing's clear though, U.S. politics and Donald [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=134.72s)]
*  Trump have thrown this campaign somewhat off course. Tariffs are great. It protects, but we [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=141.92s)]
*  should have had terrorist protection many years ago. It looks bad now because they're used to a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  system where you sell off assets overseas. America's fantastic. Trump's the best thing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  ever. It's going nuts. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=156.32s)]
*  show. I'm just watching. It's quite interesting to watch. I mean, it's entertaining. It probably [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=162.32s)]
*  affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it. Labour Prime Minister Anthony Albanese [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=167.6s)]
*  and rival Peter Dutton have repeatedly had to answer questions on Trump. Not everyone, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=173.76s)]
*  though, satisfied with the answers. Which is why independent candidates and smaller parties [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  are doing well. Voters fed up with traditional politics. Since Trump has come in, we've seen [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=186.16s)]
*  a huge shift in the global geopolitical order. And Australia's in this position where the U.S. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=193.04s)]
*  is a close ally and has been for 80 years, but China is our major trading partner. So we have [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=199.84s)]
*  to balance these interests very carefully. Canvases are eager to sway any voters who are still [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  undecided. It's like our overall economy and also defence. Energy policy and cost of living. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=212.16000000000003s)]
*  I care a lot about climate change and also queer rights. A lot of the world is turning very [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  conservative, I guess. That's very scary to me. And global politics is increasingly hard to ignore [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=223.68s)]
*  when it comes to casting a vote. Initially, the focus was on the cost of eggs, the cost of living [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=229.84s)]
*  in general, the cost of energy. But there are some things that are more important than the cost of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  eggs. And so, yeah, democracy itself. Canada is a good example. Its Liberal Party was unelectable [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=240.88s)]
*  six months ago. But their elections this week were totally transformed by Donald Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  People here haven't been affected as much by Trump's policies. But what we saw early this [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=254.72s)]
*  week in Canada, this leaning towards incumbents, the familiar in an uncertain world, well, polls [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=259.2s)]
*  predict that scenario will play out here too. Australia prides itself on mateship. Staying [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=264.48s)]
*  onside with its friends matters. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=271.6s)]
*  but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out this unpredictability. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=277.68s)]
*  It really is fascinating to see how events unfolding all the way across on the other side [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  of the world can have an impact here on domestic issues here in Australia. We can discuss this a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=291.44s)]
*  bit further with Conrad Benjamin. He's creator, editor and presenter of the punters politics [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=296.64s)]
*  podcast. That's a good tongue twister. Conrad, thanks so much for joining me today to talk about [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=301.68s)]
*  this. You've been speaking about the elections in the run up to this quite extensively. Tell us [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=306.32s)]
*  what some of your listeners and voters you've been speaking to about their main concerns leading into [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=311.6s)]
*  this election. I think the main concerns are the fact that society in general in Australia, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=316.4s)]
*  things are getting more expensive. Housing is now impossible to get into if you're millennial and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=322.88s)]
*  Gen Z. You're now 10 years away from saving to get your deposit, even if you started 10 years ago. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=326.4s)]
*  So a lot of my audience and the things I talk about is how the system is fundamentally broken [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  and we're sick of politicians who seem to be passing laws that keep this broken system going, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  that benefits their vested interests and their corporate interests and is just beating down the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=342.08s)]
*  everyday Aussie punter. So what does that mean for these people that are suffering from these policies [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  that aren't helping them then and what are they thinking about doing during this election? Not [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=354.08s)]
*  voting for the two main parties looking to independents or smaller parties perhaps or just [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=357.76s)]
*  boycotting the elections? Yeah, the best thing about our political system is that we force everyone [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  to vote and you get to preferentially list. So I can go top to bottom if the major parties [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=368.88s)]
*  are just tinkering around the edges and serving their corporate donors. I get to put a minor [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=374.64s)]
*  party or an independent and then in my electorate if they don't get up my vote will flow to who I [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=379.36s)]
*  would rather. Do I want to slap in the face or kick in the nuts? I get to choose in the end. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=385.28s)]
*  But ultimately I can put who I really want without wasting my vote, which I know in the UK and the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=389.36s)]
*  US it's a different system. So I think a lot of Aussies are very happy with our voting system [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=395.2s)]
*  that allows us to do that. Yeah, it does really enable young voters or voters across the spectrum [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=399.76s)]
*  in Australia to really properly engage with the process and understand it's compulsory as well [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=407.68s)]
*  to vote. Do you think then that there must be a frustration then from your listeners and for the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=412.88s)]
*  young people here in Australia to really make their voices heard and what are they doing? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=419.76s)]
*  Yeah, like that we've been major parties have been horse trading back and forth. Let's take housing [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=425.68s)]
*  for the last 20 years. We have some of the most expensive housing in the world. Like you wouldn't [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=430.64s)]
*  know we live in a country with heaps of land. But for 20 years the housing crisis has gotten worse [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=435.68s)]
*  and worse and worse to the point where millennials and Jed Zed are just completely locked out. And so [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=441.2s)]
*  when you look at voting trends at the moment, Albo with his last federal election won with the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=445.68s)]
*  lowest primary vote in history. So as much as he won confidence in the major two party system [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=452.4s)]
*  is dripping away and we're going to find out tomorrow whether that trend will continue, whether [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=458.64s)]
*  generations like myself are looking for politicians to actually start fixing broken systems [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=463.52s)]
*  rather than handing us a couple of bucks and tinker around the edges and kicking the can down [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  the road. Yeah, what do you think it would take for them to address or to make significant reforms [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=472.4s)]
*  that would help? I think they have to lose. Like politicians seem to only want one thing and that's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=479.2s)]
*  power and we need to just take it off them for them to lose an election, to lose votes, to lose [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=485.52s)]
*  seats. So they wake up and go, oh, how do we get votes? Well, let's look at where the votes went. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=491.52s)]
*  Let's look at these independents that don't take corporate cash. Let's look at these independents [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=497.68s)]
*  that don't go work for oil and gas lobby groups just after they made the rules for it, right? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  So I think the only thing that teaches these politicians a lesson is losing and let's hope [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=506.8s)]
*  that there are lessons to be taught from the Aussie punter to the politician tomorrow. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=511.6s)]
*  All right, Conrad, we'll leave it there. But thanks very much for your insight to annual [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=519.44s)]
*  perspective. Do appreciate your time with us. Conrad Benjamin, creator, editor and presenter [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=522.08s)]
*  of the punters politics podcast. Yeah, Martin, so you can see there's quite a bit of frustration [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=526.24s)]
*  in the younger population here in Australia that their voices perhaps aren't being heard and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=533.44s)]
*  their concerns aren't being appropriately addressed. And we'll have to see if they take [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=538.6400000000001s)]
*  words or if we see what Conrad play out and they take it to the ballot box and respond [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=543.44s)]
*  in that way. We'll be keeping a close eye on that. Polling opens at eight o'clock in the morning [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=548.72s)]
*  on Saturday here in Australia and we'll be keeping a close eye on it throughout the day [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=552.72s)]
*  and into the evening as well when those results start to come in right here on BBC News. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=557.84s)]
*  Steve Lye reporting there from Sydney and there's much more on the background to the Australian [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  elections on the BBC News website and more analysis of some of the issues that Steve [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=568.4s)]
*  and his guests were touching upon there. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tystIg2zJsg&t=573.6s)]
