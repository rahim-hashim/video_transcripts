Video Description: One person has been killed and four injured in Russia's latest missile attack on Ukraine's capital overnight.
 
Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said a nine-year-old girl was among the injured in the attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
 
The Ukrainian military said it had shot down six out of seven ballistic missiles and 71 drones launched by Russia overnight.
 
It comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested Ukraine would be prepared to swap land with Russia in potential peace negotiations.
 
The attack caused damage in Kyiv's Holosiivskyi, Podilskyi, Sviatoshynskyi and Obolonskyi districts, Klitschko said on Telegram.

# One killed in ballistic missile attack on Kyiv, Ukraine says | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0)
*  As we heard in that news conference with Mark Fogel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump suggested his release could be a big important [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=3.44s)]
*  part of ending Russia's war in Ukraine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  The violence has continued overnight with a Russian missile [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=9.32s)]
*  attack on Kiev, which killed at least one person. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=12.32s)]
*  Let's speak now to our correspondent there, James Waterhouse. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=14.92s)]
*  Good to talk to you, James. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  First of all, just bring us up to date on the latest that we're [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=19.72s)]
*  hearing about some attacks in Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it was a busy night here in Kiev. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  We had a number of booms from about 4am. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=27.4s)]
*  They don't happen as frequently as they did, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=32.28s)]
*  but they can ramp up very easily. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=35.0s)]
*  There was a reported ballistic missile attack launched by Russia, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=38.08s)]
*  as it typically does, which targeted Kiev. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=42.04s)]
*  Behind me in one of the districts here, the Podolski District, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  we're told a building was on fire and at least one person was [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=49.56s)]
*  When we're talking about ballistic missiles, they're always [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=53.84s)]
*  harder to intercept for the city's air defences, and I think [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  it's worth remembering that we're going to hear a lot about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=60.0s)]
*  peace talks, we're going to hear a lot about the political [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  language around them and if or when they might happen. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=66.48s)]
*  But all the while, this is a war that is ploughing on, this is a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=69.84s)]
*  full-scale invasion that Ukraine is continuing to weather and that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=73.56s)]
*  Russia is continuing to fight back. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=77.16s)]
*  So that was the story of the night. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=79.88000000000001s)]
*  The capitals had quite a disturbed night's sleep, but of course, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=81.84s)]
*  there are countless towns and cities that have it even worse, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=85.48s)]
*  especially when they're close to the vast front line in the south [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  and east of the country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=93.04s)]
*  Indeed, James. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=94.84s)]
*  Let's talk a bit about the politics. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=95.84s)]
*  We heard there from President Trump, who believes that Mark Fogle [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=97.84s)]
*  returning home and the conversations that he's had with [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  the people of the country, and he's said that he's going to be [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=105.12s)]
*  returning home to Ukraine, and the conversations that he's had in the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=108.96s)]
*  aftermath could actually see an end to the war. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=112.8s)]
*  What's the assessment from Kyiv on that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=115.4s)]
*  Well, President Zelensky says this phrase time and time again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=117.4s)]
*  He says that there can be no talks on Ukraine without Ukraine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=121.4s)]
*  It's something he's increasingly tried to reiterate. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=125.4s)]
*  And I think this prisoner exchange, while good news for the family of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=129.4s)]
*  Mark Fogle and the man himself, is a good news for the people of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=134.0s)]
*  Ukraine, and this being a political coup for Donald Trump, it will [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=139.48s)]
*  concern Kyiv, because clearly, when we're talking about a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=143.32s)]
*  negotiation between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, these are two [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=146.72s)]
*  leaders that will want something in it for themselves. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=150.92s)]
*  They will be negotiating an outcome, a favourable outcome. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=153.92s)]
*  Donald Trump has his with this prisoner release, so the question [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=157.92s)]
*  here is, what is the Kremlin getting in return? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=161.92s)]
*  Will it pave the way for favourable conditions for Russia to end this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  war, to perhaps retain the territory it has seized, perhaps a relaxing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  of the sanctions imposed on Russia? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  That will be the very real concern here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  The White House, as far as Ukraine is concerned, Donald Trump hasn't [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  said he's voiced an interest in visiting Kyiv yet. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  He's got his eyes on the country's natural resources and minerals, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  and he has a plan to use that to exploit as a return for the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=193.56s)]
*  billions of American dollars that Ukraine has received. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=198.56s)]
*  And so, we are in a phase of this war where there's a lot of talk [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=201.56s)]
*  about peace talks, talks about talks, but also we're seeing Ukraine [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=204.56s)]
*  having to go into pitching mode, it's having to sell the reasons as [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=208.56s)]
*  to why it thinks the West should keep supporting it as it stands up [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=212.56s)]
*  to Russia's ongoing invasion. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbPSWeQOO0&t=216.56s)]
