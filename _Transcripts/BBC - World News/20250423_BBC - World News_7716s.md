# LIVE: Pope Francis's coffin moved to St Peter's Basilica for public mourning | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8)
*  As we watch Catherine the Pope moving slowly through the basilica he loved so dearly, Catholics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=0.0s)]
*  around the world in mourning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=24.56s)]
*  According to martyrdom for the Catholic Church you were just talking to Austen there about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=54.56s)]
*  the Litany of the Saints and many of the names of those saints are the very first saints [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=59.84s)]
*  and martyrs of the Church. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  People like Priscilla Perpetua, Cosmas Danium and the journey went through the Square of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=70.0s)]
*  the Proto Martyrs that was built over where the circus of the Emperor Nero had been where [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=77.6s)]
*  so many early Christians were put to death. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  Just behind the procession was the obelisk in the centre of St Peter's Square. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=89.28s)]
*  That used to stand, it was brought from Egypt and it used to stand in that circus where [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  they put the martyrs to death. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=99.32s)]
*  And now we are seeing the carnals in their red, the symbol of martyrdom, of the blood [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  of martyrs and while Pope Francis was not a martyr he was a man like all Christians [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  born to sacrifice their life for Christ and that sacrifice for him meant leaving his native [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  Argentina to which he never returned and devoting his life to leading the Church. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=129.96s)]
*  And this liturgy, quite a lot of it will refer to him as it would for any Christian to being [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=138.84s)]
*  a servant, serving the Lord and I'm sure Catholics around the world would be praying that Pope [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=148.28s)]
*  Francis now has the heavenly reward for that life of sacrifice and service. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=159.64s)]

*  We heard the invocation of the saints. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2093.38s)]
*  We heard a prayer for Saint Francis, for Pope Francis and for the patron saints. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2097.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm joined here by Austin Ivory, Pope Francis' biographer who was with me watching and listening [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2111.26s)]
*  to that. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2120.14s)]
*  Tell us, Austin, a little bit more about the significance of what we've just seen. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2121.14s)]
*  This is a moment, as I was saying earlier, which is part of the process of coming to [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2129.18s)]
*  terms with the passing of Pope Francis. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2133.14s)]
*  It's a moment where, of course, the cardinals brought him in so that the body can be put [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2136.98s)]
*  on display, so there's a line in the state. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2144.8599999999997s)]
*  So the faithful can now, over the next days until the funeral on Saturday, come and pay [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2147.78s)]
*  their respects and absolutely anybody can come and do that. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2153.1000000000004s)]
*  Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the chamberlain, the one who's leading the process of this vacancy, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2156.82s)]
*  as it's called, concluded that it was a very simple liturgy. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2162.44s)]
*  In fact, not really very dissimilar from any other kind of lying in state, but with particular [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2166.1400000000003s)]
*  prayers for the late Pope Francis that the chief shepherd who eternally lives to intercede [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2172.44s)]
*  for us may welcome him into his kingdom of light and peace. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  And then prayers for the church, prayers for every people and nation that in the pursuit [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2181.4s)]
*  of justice they may dwell in peace as one family united by affection. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2185.64s)]
*  And so it's a moment of prayer. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2190.8s)]
*  It was a moment, a solemn moment, where Pope Francis' body is put on display and the people [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2192.66s)]
*  of God led by the pastors pray, simply pray. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2199.24s)]
*  So a time now of prayer over the next two days, of recollection, of giving thanks for [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2203.64s)]
*  everything that the Pope has meant to the Catholic Church and to the whole of humanity. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2209.68s)]
*  This was a Pope who reached out beyond the boundaries, all the boundaries that exist. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2214.98s)]
*  He reached, had an extraordinary capacity to reach beyond them. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2219.64s)]
*  So I would say a global moment of prayer and recollection and one that I think is very, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2222.8399999999997s)]
*  very important in this process. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2229.0s)]
*  Austin, thank you. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2233.4s)]
*  And if I could bring in at this moment, Catherine Pepinster, religion commentator and former [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2234.4s)]
*  editor of the Catholic News Weekly, the Tablet. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2242.36s)]
*  Catherine, you too were watching that ceremony and now as the ceremony comes to an end, the [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2245.92s)]
*  body will lie in state where it is now and people will begin to file past it to pay their respect. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2256.6s)]
*  Yes, that's right, Marianne. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2268.36s)]
*  One thing that I find very noticeable about this moment, very moving moment, the Cardinals [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2271.4s)]
*  are beginning the process of people paying their respects. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2277.16s)]
*  The Pope's body is lying before the high altar in St Peter's and that is built above what [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2282.8399999999997s)]
*  Catholics believe is the tomb of Peter, the first apostle and the first Pope. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2290.44s)]
*  So there's that symbolism there of taking us back to Christ and his first followers [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2299.7599999999998s)]
*  and now we pay our respects to the leader of Catholics until just the other day. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2308.2799999999997s)]
*  The other thing that strikes me is that one of the prayers said and was sung during that [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2317.88s)]
*  service in Latin was the Lord's Prayer, the prayer that all Christians know so well. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2324.68s)]
*  And amongst the words, of course, of that prayer are the words, forgive us our trespasses [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2331.04s)]
*  as we forgive those who trespass against us. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2337.56s)]
*  And that reminds me of Pope Francis because Pope Francis spoke so much about forgiveness [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2340.6s)]
*  and talked so much about God's mercy. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2346.16s)]
*  He urged people to turn to God, to the merciful God and so I thought those words were particularly [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2350.16s)]
*  poignant today. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2357.44s)]
*  The ceremony is now over. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2367.56s)]
*  The Pope will remain where he is and as we watch the Cardinals file past his coffin, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2395.56s)]
*  I from where I am standing can see crowds of people starting to move away from the seated [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2410.7599999999998s)]
*  area from which they watched the procession and to join the queue. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2421.8s)]
*  And I can tell you from where I am standing, the queue is already long and dense, filled [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2428.8s)]
*  with people waiting to be allowed their chance, their opportunity to file past the body of [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2435.1200000000003s)]
*  the Pope, to see him for a final time and to pay their respects. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2443.12s)]
*  But in this moment, it is those inside the Basilica who are doing just that. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2452.12s)]
*  The sign of the cross made in front of the Pope as the Swiss guards watch on, the bishops [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2472.12s)]
*  move one by one. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2492.3599999999997s)]
*  And as we watch these pictures, let us bring in my colleague Mark Lowen who is in St Peter [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2501.36s)]
*  Square. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2508.8s)]
*  Mark it was an absolutely incredible moment. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2511.92s)]
*  I'm sure you were there when the Pope first entered the Square and the applause rang out. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2513.6400000000003s)]
*  The applause of so many hundreds, perhaps even thousands of worshippers who have come [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2522.6800000000003s)]
*  here to say their goodbyes. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2529.42s)]
*  Yeah indeed, Mariam, the Square has been very full today, people waiting at the barriers [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2534.3s)]
*  here to try to catch a glimpse on big screens by the Basilica as the body of Pope Francis [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2539.52s)]
*  was taken in to the Basilica in that open casket to be placed before the altar of the [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2547.02s)]
*  Confession, which of course is covered by that beautiful bronze balderkin designed by [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2553.6s)]
*  the Baroque artist Benigni beneath Michelangelo's dome. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2561.2599999999998s)]
*  And they are expecting tens of thousands of people between now and Saturday to file in [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2566.34s)]
*  to St Peter's Basilica to catch a final glimpse of Pope Francis who has been temporarily embalmed. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2572.98s)]
*  He is wearing his red robes and mitre and holding rosary beads in his coffin before [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2580.98s)]
*  that funeral on Saturday morning. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2588.94s)]
*  The Basilica will be open until midnight today and tomorrow and then on Friday it will close [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2591.7400000000002s)]
*  at 7pm before the funeral takes place on Saturday morning, a funeral that will be attended by [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2600.22s)]
*  heads of state, royalty and world leaders from right across the globe. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2607.2999999999997s)]
*  Well among those on the Square here planning to go inside the Basilica over the next couple [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2612.7s)]
*  of days, I've just met Margo from France who actually lives here in Rome, very close to [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2619.18s)]
*  here and runs a restaurant very close to St Peter's Square. Margo, very nice to talk to [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2624.3399999999997s)]
*  you. Just give us a sense of your reaction when you got the news a couple of days ago [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2628.8599999999997s)]
*  first of all of the Pope's passing. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2634.6200000000003s)]
*  I guess I was really surprised and emotional. We heard the news Monday morning around 10 [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2637.1400000000003s)]
*  and the day before he was there in St Peter's Square for Pasqua and it was a bit of a shock [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2643.6200000000003s)]
*  but we are really glad to be here and to be able to come and gather here today. We'll [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2651.02s)]
*  go tonight to see him inside the Basilica and we'll be definitely here on Saturday morning. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2656.38s)]
*  What has it been like for you over the last couple of days? You know this area so well, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2662.62s)]
*  your restaurant I gather is just very close to St Peter's Square. You've seen already [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2666.66s)]
*  tens of thousands of people, pilgrims, faithful tourists coming here and it's only going to [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2670.2799999999997s)]
*  grow over the next few days. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2675.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird because we live right there so we come here very often and we come at [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2677.42s)]
*  night, Piazza is totally empty and now it's weird seeing this big event happening here [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2683.22s)]
*  and it's been a bit moving I guess. Like Italians they are a bit sad. It's powerful to live this. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2690.7s)]
*  What was it about Pope Francis that you liked? I gather you're Catholic and you are faithful [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2702.58s)]
*  as well. What did he mean to you? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2708.8199999999997s)]
*  Hope I guess and also it's the Jubilee of hope this year. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2713.3599999999997s)]
*  The Jubilee year of the Catholic Church. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2718.42s)]
*  He was joyful I guess. I saw him a couple of times here with a beautiful smile, message [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2721.26s)]
*  of love also. I really liked him. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2729.2200000000003s)]
*  And in terms of his views, his social views, the kind of softening, his more moderate and [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2732.26s)]
*  progressive views on social issues, was that important to you? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2738.06s)]
*  For me yeah, very important and I hope that the next Pope will follow him, follow his [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2741.42s)]
*  path. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2745.54s)]
*  That is a big question isn't it? Because 80% of the Cardinals who will be choosing his [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2747.0200000000004s)]
*  successor were appointed by him so one would have thought that would mean that that would [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2753.38s)]
*  translate into a Pope who would follow his trajectory let's say. But it's not guaranteed [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2758.2200000000003s)]
*  is it? There is a more conservative wing to the Church. Would you be worried if it swung [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2765.2200000000003s)]
*  back in that direction? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2769.7000000000003s)]
*  Of course I am worried. I'm really looking forward to what's going to happen in the next [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2770.92s)]
*  week. I hope it's going to be just like him, following his ideas. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2775.74s)]
*  What is it like Margot living here? Because the Vatican has a kind of an aura around it [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2780.74s)]
*  doesn't it? Something that's slightly mysterious, people don't know much about the Vatican unless [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2787.2999999999997s)]
*  they really do know about it. Just give us an insight into, you walk through here at [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2794.06s)]
*  night and you see the colonnades, you see the angel, you see the dome of Michelangelo, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2799.2599999999998s)]
*  you see the priests and the nuns on a daily basis. Paint the picture of what it's like [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2804.18s)]
*  living here. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2808.66s)]
*  It's kind of mysterious and at the same time it's really part of our life. Everyday I work [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2809.8799999999997s)]
*  here to go to the markets. So at some point it's really about religion and at some point [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2814.06s)]
*  it's just part of your life and you work here and you see tourists and then you see priests [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2821.66s)]
*  and then you see the Pope and it's really mixed up. It's kind of mystical at night when [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2825.98s)]
*  it's totally empty. It's beautiful, I like living right there. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2832.42s)]
*  Did you used to watch his weekly Angelus prayer or the Sunday blessing for example? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2837.42s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes we got here but also for Easter we got here of course for [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2844.62s)]
*  bigger events and on Wednesday also because every Wednesday he came here. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2851.62s)]
*  Angelus prayer. Were you here actually for his Easter Sunday blessing? His last public [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2855.38s)]
*  appearance were you here? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2859.46s)]
*  No, unfortunately I was in Tuscana so I didn't see him for the last time on Sunday. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2860.8199999999997s)]
*  Did you, I mean I'm sure you saw those images, did you feel that he looked frail? Did you [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2865.3799999999997s)]
*  get a sense that he was coming towards the end? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2871.3399999999997s)]
*  He did look tired but he got out of the hospital so I guess we hoped that he would live all [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2874.8599999999997s)]
*  the jubilee year. So no, I didn't expect this on Monday morning. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2880.8199999999997s)]
*  And what kind of a hole has he left for you, for your friends and family? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2885.94s)]
*  I guess it's a new page that's going to turn. We'll see who's the next Pope. A bit of sadness [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2893.7799999999997s)]
*  now. We'll see what's next but we're going to pray for him definitely in the next days [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2901.22s)]
*  and this morning's ceremony was beautiful. I was just right there, I saw him. Beautiful, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2906.46s)]
*  very moving. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2911.18s)]
*  Margo, lovely to talk to you, thank you very much and enjoy your life in this magnificent [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2912.74s)]
*  place. Margo's saying she will pray for him and that's absolutely what the Pope asked [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2916.66s)]
*  for at the end of every service. I've spoken to so many people in the last few days who [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2922.2599999999998s)]
*  met him and from all walks of life and they often said at the end of their meeting with [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2925.46s)]
*  him he would always say pray for me and they felt that that connected them even more with [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2929.98s)]
*  the Pope. So now three days of lying in states, the funeral on Saturday and then we are expecting [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2935.74s)]
*  that conclave, that elaborate ornate process, often a very secretive process to choose the [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2941.66s)]
*  next Pope would begin the week of the 5th of May. We will know for sure in the coming [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2947.02s)]
*  days when the start of that conclave will begin. Marion, back up to you on the rooftop [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2951.58s)]
*  above me. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2955.7799999999997s)]
*  Mark, thank you so much and we are still watching these pictures of priests and clergy paying [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2956.98s)]
*  their respects to Pope Francis and if I could bring in Austin Ivory, the Pope's biographer, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2963.98s)]
*  you knew him, you met him on numerous occasions Austin and you saw him also in death yesterday [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2970.98s)]
*  at the Chapel of St. Martha. Talk me through your feelings at this moment. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2978.54s)]
*  Well what I find beautiful about this moment is I'm looking down at the square and the [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2983.54s)]
*  people of course are filing in, there's this wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2987.86s)]
*  filing in, there's this wonderful moment now where the people, it's the ordinary faithful [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2992.54s)]
*  people, we've had a day or two of the people who work in the Vatican paying their respects [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=2997.94s)]
*  but now this is just ordinary people coming to pay their respects to give back some of [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3003.5s)]
*  the love that they've had from him over the years and I know that's certainly how I feel [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3008.62s)]
*  today, I feel I've received so much from him as his biographer, somebody who's tried to [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3012.66s)]
*  understand him and who has shown me in many ways how to be Christian in the 21st century, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3017.46s)]
*  how to love and I think many of the people who are going in there now and are going to [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3022.06s)]
*  be filing past their body, they'll be feeling exactly that, they'll feel that he was there [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3026.22s)]
*  for them and this is their moment to say thank you and what I also love about this moment [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3030.58s)]
*  is that he is raised facing the people and it is the ordinary people now coming back [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3036.5s)]
*  to him, this is a Pope of the people now again in his death with the people. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3041.9s)]
*  Such powerful words and I'm sure feelings echoed amongst Catholics around the world [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3048.38s)]
*  and we'll leave you now from the Vatican with these pictures of Pope Francis as he lies in rest. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3057.7400000000002s)]
*  Hello, welcome to the program, I'm Lewis Vaughan Jones, we're going to head straight to the Vatican [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3348.38s)]
*  to Rome and we can have these live pictures, we have a couple of live feeds of pictures coming to [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3353.34s)]
*  us from the Vatican, we'll show you these first of St Peter's Square there, St Peter's Basilica [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3358.62s)]
*  in the background, we have just come to the end of the transportation of Pope in the coffin from [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3366.06s)]
*  his resting place in his residence through the square there that we can see and is now lying [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3373.34s)]
*  in state inside St Peter's Basilica after the formal ceremony has just finished in the last [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3380.46s)]
*  10 minutes, 15 minutes or so. What we are expecting next is for many of the people there that we can [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3389.34s)]
*  see on the screen sitting and standing in the sloughed inn to start filing past to pay their [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3395.5s)]
*  respects to Pope Francis, he will be there now for the rest of the day up until Saturday the funeral. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3400.94s)]
*  These are pictures now from just a little earlier, these are the Swiss guards there accompanying [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3410.06s)]
*  the body of Pope Francis in that open coffin, this was the ceremonial part that took place just in [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3415.5s)]
*  the last couple of hours this morning, being moved from his place of residence which is just [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3424.2200000000003s)]
*  behind St Peter's Basilica, just behind St Peter's Square effectively and was carried there [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3430.54s)]
*  accompanied by the Swiss guards as we just saw but also cardinals in the red, the bishops in the [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3437.82s)]
*  purple and there was this procession through up into inside St Peter's Basilica as we can see there [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3445.42s)]
*  and that is where the body of Pope Francis will now stay for the days ahead as people [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3454.9399999999996s)]
*  will be allowed in and allowed to file past and pay their final respects. Well there are plenty [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3461.98s)]
*  of people in St Peter's Square as we just saw in those live images and our correspondent Mark [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3468.3799999999997s)]
*  Glowen is also there. Mark what's been happening there? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3474.14s)]
*  Hi Lewis, yes well it's been a bit square, thousands of people have been waiting by the barrier to [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3477.74s)]
*  catch a glimpse of the basilica behind me and the procession into the main door of the basilica [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3483.58s)]
*  with the coffin of Pope Francis which is now lying before the altar of the confession inside [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3490.14s)]
*  the basilica under which is believed to be the tomb of St Peter. Remember each pope is [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3497.5s)]
*  elected to be the successor to St Peter and that is where the open coffin of Pope Francis will lie [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3505.02s)]
*  now until Saturday morning when the funeral begins and they are expecting tens of thousands [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3512.06s)]
*  of people every day to go into the basilica until midnight every day until Friday evening at 7 p.m [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3518.7s)]
*  when the basilica will be closed before that funeral on Saturday, a funeral which is going to [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3525.5s)]
*  attract heads of states and world leaders from right across the globe and then of course Pope [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3530.54s)]
*  Francis will be buried on the other side of Rome at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3537.34s)]
*  It is more than a century since a pope was buried outside the Vatican and that is very much a sign [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3541.74s)]
*  of how Pope Francis wanted a more humble more simple end to his life. Well two of those who [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3549.1s)]
*  are hoping to go inside the basilica to catch a final glimpse of the pope are Craig and Paula who [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3556.14s)]
*  are over from Australia and they were here on holiday and then saw the news heard the news that [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3561.58s)]
*  the pope had died. Craig just give me a sense of your reaction when you heard that news. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3569.02s)]
*  Well we weren't surprised I have to say because we knew he'd been very ill but we were here on the [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3575.42s)]
*  Sunday service when he was spent some time in the basilica and he was very upset that he had [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3580.7799999999997s)]
*  spent some time on the balcony and we have a staying in a hotel only a few meters away and [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3585.74s)]
*  we heard the bells ringing at 7.35 in the morning we thought that was a little odd and then we looked [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3590.54s)]
*  on the news and we found out that he passed away overnight which was very ironic or bizarre in a [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3595.18s)]
*  way because we'd only just seen him the night before on the balcony and he seemed okay. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3601.02s)]
*  Happy Easter. Yeah very much but to learn that he died of a secondary illness rather than pneumonia [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3606.7799999999997s)]
*  was interesting but I'm not surprising. Paula I know you are Catholic so how did you feel [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3614.3s)]
*  not just in terms of losing a world leader but also I suppose your spiritual connection to [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3621.9s)]
*  Well I guess I'm not a practicing Catholic but I guess being here I'm swept up in the emotions [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3627.34s)]
*  of things and it's brought back some memories of my childhood my schooling so yeah and it's [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3633.34s)]
*  definitely been a diversion from our holiday I've made Craig come along to some of these events [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3641.42s)]
*  and particularly because of Easter Sunday service we came for that not knowing that that was on as [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3648.86s)]
*  well and so we got out of from our holiday and came to be here for that service and again today [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3656.3s)]
*  seeing different people the type of worship and yeah just being amongst these people and [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3663.66s)]
*  What did you make of Pope Francis how did he how did he strike you? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3669.98s)]
*  A caring humble man we only found out yesterday because we're actually in there which again is [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3674.78s)]
*  quite ironic on tour our tour guide spoke to us and mentioned something about his accommodation [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3681.26s)]
*  where he wanted to live rather than wanting to live in something more elaborate he had asked to live [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3688.22s)]
*  in the guest house Santa Marta guest house so yeah we thought that straight away that matched [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3696.3s)]
*  what we'd heard about him over the years about his kindness and and maybe that he [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3702.94s)]
*  and I don't know he believed in being that kind of kind person what about his um his kind of [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3712.38s)]
*  view social views um slightly more progressive on the more moderate side let's say of the [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3719.5800000000004s)]
*  Catholic Church Paul how did that did that chime with with your with your views it certainly did [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3724.46s)]
*  I'm hoping we were talking earlier we're hoping that they they vote in another liberal um cardinal [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3729.42s)]
*  to follow in in the teachings that he's been adapting I think to the modern world they may go [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3735.1800000000003s)]
*  more conservative and I think we're quite interested in how that plays out um but we very [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3741.5s)]
*  much respected the the inclusive nature of some of his teachings and the reinterpretation of some [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3745.98s)]
*  of the Catholic doctrine uh over the past few years yeah I mean he he's appointed about 80 [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3751.18s)]
*  percent of those cardinals who will choose the the next pope so it is it is thought likely that [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3756.54s)]
*  it will be somebody who is more on that wing of the church the Francis wing of the church but of [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3763.02s)]
*  course one never knows um Paula what has been the reaction in Australia actually and and and also [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3766.94s)]
*  the reaction from the Australian government not so much on the government but part of um what how [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3772.3799999999997s)]
*  we found out which again was quite ironic um when we were at um walking around Rome it was [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3777.98s)]
*  actually Craig's sister who sent us a message we didn't know that the pope had passed um so she [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3784.46s)]
*  sent us a text message and said what is it like in Rome have you heard the news and assumed that [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3790.94s)]
*  we had and we she was the one that contacted us and actually let us know what had happened [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3796.78s)]
*  have you heard about you know mourning or masses back in Australia for example no not at this stage [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3803.82s)]
*  no but our current prime minister is an italian catholic of heritage and they're in an election [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3810.94s)]
*  campaign so I think they're fairly focused on on that coming up and they may not make the trip over [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3816.2200000000003s)]
*  unfortunately for the funeral how important will it be for you to to go inside the basilica to say [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3821.42s)]
*  final farewell to the pope the idea of going in perhaps tonight um you know before midnight [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3827.18s)]
*  yeah I think it is important I'm hoping Craig will join me um to be part of this it's very [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3835.18s)]
*  significant moment in history Craig you're not catholic but is it important for you [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3841.9s)]
*  he was a significant world leader I think you know I respect um the role he plays in the world I [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3847.98s)]
*  respect the people here who are devout and the fact I chose not to be is irrelevant to me these [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3853.34s)]
*  people here who care very very much and he was an important world figure so you know I respect the [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3858.78s)]
*  significance of this occasion and I'm I'm very thankful I'm in some small part sort of part of [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3864.7000000000003s)]
*  it and can put it in my memories for the future give us a sense um Paula of the mood that you are [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3871.26s)]
*  seeing here I mean it's such a busy square and uh you know you're seeing you're seeing the clergy [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3877.34s)]
*  you're seeing pilgrims you're seeing the faithful I mean I suppose it's had you imagined that some [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3882.62s)]
*  Peter Square would be like this and we would see even more momentous a time of course given what [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3888.38s)]
*  has happened no I wasn't expecting it a little bit because of Easter and I saw what happens to [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3892.14s)]
*  you for Easter Sunday but when I look around now I guess I knew I knew that it would be you know [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3899.66s)]
*  it's significant to everybody um yeah and it's this bringing back I mean you said it's bringing [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3907.74s)]
*  back thoughts about your your childhood I don't know if you were at a Catholic school or something [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3913.1s)]
*  or did you I mean were you raised in quite a in quite a Catholic way yes I was and Catholic [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3916.8599999999997s)]
*  schooling um so yeah it does bring back um memories of that um my parents were very Catholic [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3922.46s)]
*  particularly my mum um yes I think I even said to Craig a couple of times [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3931.18s)]
*  I wish my mum was here um I know how important it would have been for her would she have been [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3937.4199999999996s)]
*  a fan of Pope Francis I think so um I think she would have um also appreciated how the [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3943.8199999999997s)]
*  Catholic Church was moving um yeah a little bit more inclusive and I think she would have [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3950.62s)]
*  you know she would have actually thought that that was a great way for the future what do you [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3957.74s)]
*  feel needs to move in the Catholic Church in this 2000 year old institution that moves very slowly [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3962.94s)]
*  well you'd hope some of the things that we'd spoken about that um now the Catholic Church [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3970.62s)]
*  are beginning to accept and we even spoke as we are seeing some of the people pass through [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3978.8599999999997s)]
*  we had conversations about what country the person may come from that kind of background so [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3984.62s)]
*  yeah yeah whether we're ready for an African leader or an Asian leader of the Catholic Church [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3990.94s)]
*  there's a lot of questions about how progressive the Church will be ready to be now or whether [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=3997.5s)]
*  there'll be another generation before we see something like that happen but we look on with [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4003.74s)]
*  great interest Craig and Paula it's been lovely to talk to you happy rest of your holidays and [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=4007.8199999999997s)]

*  conclave and an elaborate secretive ceremony to choose the next pope. Do you have any hopes [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5546.5599999999995s)]
*  that there could be maybe a Mexican pope to take over? Well, whoever who's like the most [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5553.679999999999s)]
*  able to take the place, it's going to be so. Yeah, not really. I think just like you said [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5560.0s)]
*  before to pray and to have the best one and to the cardinals are going to be in there [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5567.08s)]
*  to have the blessing from God and to make the right decision. And we're just very hopeful [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5572.48s)]
*  for the new pope. Do you hope that the next pope would be in the same image of Francis [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5577.4s)]
*  in a sense, a more progressive wing of the church? Or do you feel, I mean, do you fear [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5583.04s)]
*  that it could swing back in a different direction? I think I'm not qualified enough to give my [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5589.04s)]
*  opinion in that regard. Some people that are very, very qualified and have the grace of [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5594.72s)]
*  God will make that decision and whatever happens will be for the best. Macarena, how important [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5599.4800000000005s)]
*  will it be for you to go inside that basilica? I understand that it's going to be logistically [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5604.08s)]
*  quite difficult with thousands of people trying to get in today. But can you sort of picture [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5610.04s)]
*  a little bit how you might feel as you're going through and seeing him in his open coffin? [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5615.400000000001s)]
*  Well, it's going to be a lot of emotions, but I'm just, I would just be really happy [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5620.84s)]
*  to be there and pay my respects. Macarena and Luis, once again, congratulations to you [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5625.24s)]
*  both and I hope that you have a happy rest of your honeymoon and I hope you get in to [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5631.32s)]
*  be able to see Pope Francis in his open coffin. Thank you very much for talking to us today. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5635.639999999999s)]
*  So there are going to be very big crowds who will go in right through the day today. You [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5640.88s)]
*  can see already there are crowds lining up here with the Italian police, the Carabinieri, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5645.8s)]
*  keeping guard. And then of course it will be a huge security apparatus in place for [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5651.08s)]
*  Saturday with the likes of President Trump, President Macron of France, the Brazilian [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5655.8s)]
*  president, Siqueir Starmer, British Prime Minister already confirming their attendance [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5660.6s)]
*  at the funeral. Then there will be nine days of mourning and we are expecting the conclave, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5665.4800000000005s)]
*  that process that many of you will be familiar with, not least from the Oscar nominated film [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5671.400000000001s)]
*  with Ralph Fiennes and Stanley Tucci. That process will begin likely to be the week of [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5675.24s)]
*  the 5th of May as we will wait, we'll be back here on St Peter's Square waiting for the [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5680.5199999999995s)]
*  white smoke from the Vatican to say that they have chosen the successor to Pope Francis. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5684.44s)]
*  With that, it's back to you, Luis, in London. Mark, thank you so much for that. We're going [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5690.36s)]
*  to head from outside there where Mark is to inside. These are the live pictures. We're [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5694.5199999999995s)]
*  going to keep across these. This is now the official period of the Pope lying in state [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5699.6s)]
*  and there are expected to be thousands upon thousands of people that will queue and enter [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5705.280000000001s)]
*  St Peter's Basilica there and file past the coffin of the late Pope Francis as his body [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5712.0s)]
*  lies in state there. As we keep across these live pictures, we're going to speak to Tabitha [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5718.56s)]
*  Smith, Catholic journalist for the Catholic magazine at the Tablet. Thank you for coming [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5724.08s)]
*  on the programme. Hi, thank you. As we just see these pictures there of those thousands of people [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5728.24s)]
*  that will over the next couple of days file past the body of Pope Francis, just talk us through [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5733.76s)]
*  the significance of this moment. I mean, it is an incredibly mournful time, but it is wonderful to [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5740.24s)]
*  see how many Catholics and non-Catholics are turning out to pay their respects. I think, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5746.48s)]
*  looking at the footage from this morning, I was really struck by that antithetical image of Pope [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5751.92s)]
*  Francis during COVID, praying alone in St Peter's Square for the world. Now after he's passed, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5758.56s)]
*  the whole world has turned up to see him. I think that's just indicative of how such an amazing pope [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5766.320000000001s)]
*  he was, that he really touched people's hearts. Talk us through what you made and what stood out [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5773.6s)]
*  for you with the ceremony this morning, the moving of the body from the chapel in his residence [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5779.04s)]
*  through St Peter's Square and into a position there in St Peter's Basilica. I think you could [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5785.68s)]
*  tell that the crowd and the procession was just full of huge respect for Francis, even down to his [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5792.96s)]
*  his coffin, a very simple woodlined coffin. I think he kept that humility all the way to the end. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5800.400000000001s)]
*  I was in Rome for Pope Benedict's when he, Pope Benedict, lay in state. That, of course, was still [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5811.76s)]
*  a mournful time, but still a very respectful time. I'm sure that those thousands of people over the [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5817.52s)]
*  next few days are turning up to see Pope Francis will be showing the same respect. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5824.16s)]
*  During his time as the pope, he was very popular amongst certain quarters, of course, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5831.12s)]
*  far less popular and criticized amongst others. But let's focus for a moment just on young people. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5835.84s)]
*  What do you think his influence was there? I think Pope Francis was so important to young [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5841.36s)]
*  Catholics. I was 10 years old when Pope Francis became pope in 2013. Through that time, he's [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5847.6s)]
*  walked together with us as young people. He has shown us how to be compassionate. He's shown us [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5857.200000000001s)]
*  how to care for the environment and to not be afraid to speak out for social justice. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5862.96s)]
*  And those issues, because, of course, he faced criticism on any, well, pick any issue, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5870.32s)]
*  the environment, the role of women, gay people, the handling of the child sex abuse scandals [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5879.5199999999995s)]
*  throughout the church, throughout the world. There will always be the more progressive side [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5886.0s)]
*  of the church criticized him for not going far enough, for the more conservative wing [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5890.4s)]
*  criticized him for going too far. What's your general stance? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5894.799999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of people like to criticize the pope, like you say, for doing either too much or [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5898.719999999999s)]
*  too little. And we have to remember that the pope is just one man. And obviously, he comes into the [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5905.679999999999s)]
*  papacy with his own views. And whoever the next successor will be will also have their own views [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5911.84s)]
*  and might change things. We have to remember that if people are criticized Francis for not going [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5918.24s)]
*  too far, too little, we're not in his position. We were not in his position. So it's difficult [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5925.280000000001s)]
*  for us to criticize him. I think if any of us were in the position of the pope, we would be [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5931.4400000000005s)]
*  feeling the same stresses. I think the main thing that's a comfort to a lot of Catholics is that [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5936.320000000001s)]
*  the spirit is leading the discernment of the church and its course. And I think that I hope [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5941.280000000001s)]
*  that the spirit continues to work through the coming weeks and into the conclave and the [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5950.48s)]
*  election of the new pope. And that's a really important factor. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5955.36s)]
*  Well, let's just spend a moment on that then. What will you be hoping for from the next pope? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5960.879999999999s)]
*  Well, I think Francis has built a very firm foundation in terms of standing up for [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5966.959999999999s)]
*  for the marginalized groups and vulnerable people, and also creating a foundation of [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5973.84s)]
*  compassion and love. And I hope that the next pope builds upon that. I think Francis has [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5980.08s)]
*  set the standard for a modern pope. And I think whoever will be the new pope has a lot to live [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5988.08s)]
*  up to in that respect. I mean, Francis touched so many hearts. And I'm sure that whoever the next [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=5994.4s)]
*  pope will be will be feeling that pressure. But I'm sure that he will be guided by the spirit and [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6001.2s)]
*  ultimately will be successful. Tabitha Smith, thank you very much for coming on the program. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6006.639999999999s)]

*  Peter's Basilica for a period of public mourning until his funeral on Saturday. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6043.92s)]

*  expected to file past the open coffin. It's been a busy morning here on St Peter's Square, as you [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6062.08s)]
*  can imagine, with thousands of people crowding onto the square watching that service that was on [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6067.36s)]
*  big screens behind me as the coffin of Pope Francis was taken from the residence where he lived [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6072.8s)]
*  during his 12 years as pope, the Santa Marta residence inside the Vatican, and it was taken [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6079.68s)]
*  to St Peter's Basilica where it now lies before the altar of the Confession, an altar beneath which [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6084.96s)]
*  it is believed that the tomb of St Peter lies. Of course, remember, popes are thought to be by the [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6091.04s)]
*  faithful successors to St Peter. It's an altar that is covered by a bronze baldekin which was [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6097.52s)]
*  designed and created by the baroque 16th century artist Bernini, and then that lies below the [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6105.12s)]
*  fantastic gilded dome of St Peter's Basilica which is from Michelangelo, and then that basilica [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6112.24s)]
*  will be open until midnight today and tomorrow for the faithful to file in to try to catch a glimpse [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6119.04s)]
*  of Pope Francis who lies in that open coffin. He's been temporarily embalmed. He is wearing a [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6125.2s)]
*  mitre, his red vestments, he's holding rosary beads, and then on Friday the basilica will close [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6131.2s)]
*  at 7 p.m. ready for that funeral to start on Saturday morning, a funeral that will attract [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6136.32s)]
*  world leaders, royalty and heads of state from around the world, and then following the funeral [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6142.5599999999995s)]
*  the coffin will be taken across Rome to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore which is where [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6147.679999999999s)]
*  Pope Francis wants to be buried. It's more than a century since a pope was not buried. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6153.04s)]
*  A century since a pope was not buried at the Vatican and very much symbolic of how Francis [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6158.88s)]
*  wanted a humbler, simpler end to his life. Well among those hoping to get into the basilica to [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6165.2s)]
*  say a final farewell to Pope Francis are Macarena and Luis from Mexico who are actually over here on [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6171.68s)]
*  their honeymoon. Congratulations first of all for your wedding and I gather you were hoping to have [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6178.0s)]
*  a papal audience today? Yes, we came here because the pope receives newlyweds and he gives like a [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6183.2s)]
*  special blessing so we just came to Rome. I think that was the best way to start our marriage and [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6190.48s)]
*  we were just hoping to see the pope and now we're just hoping to go in and be able to pay our [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6196.24s)]
*  respects. And how did it feel Macarena, I understand you were in transit to Rome when you got the news [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6201.76s)]
*  of his death on Monday morning? Yeah I mean it's not about us so we're just happy to be here in [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6207.92s)]
*  such a special moment as well and we're happy to pay our respects to the pope. What was going [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6213.52s)]
*  through your mind when you got that news and it must have been an emotional moment for you both? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6218.4s)]
*  Yeah it was emotional and we were like wow I can't believe that we're gonna be in Rome when this is [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6222.8s)]
*  happening. We're also happy like we're not gonna receive the papal audience but it's so much [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6228.64s)]
*  happening right now and we're just happy to be here and pay our respects. What would it have meant [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6236.16s)]
*  Luis to have that audience today? It would have meant a lot but as Macarena said it's a very [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6241.5199999999995s)]
*  important day, it's a very important couple of days just to be here to pray and just to feel [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6249.04s)]
*  everybody praying it's more important so I think we received the blessing from above. So you feel [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6255.44s)]
*  that being able to go inside there and see him in his final resting place, almost final resting [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6262.56s)]
*  place, do you feel that that will create in a sense that kind of connection that you would have [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6267.92s)]
*  had maybe in person today? Yes definitely I think the pope Francis is a saint and he will bless us [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6271.68s)]
*  from heaven and we're very happy just to be here and to feel that connection we felt it already [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6279.4400000000005s)]
*  and we're very blessed. Macarena what was it about pope Francis that you loved? I loved his humility [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6284.08s)]
*  and was it important for you that he was the first pope from the Americas? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6292.72s)]
*  Well yes, yes it was he was from Argentina. Yes I mean I think Pope Francis came in a very [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6297.52s)]
*  important time he's a pope for the people he taught us to be just more in depth with our more in touch [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6306.4800000000005s)]
*  with other persons and to be more humble so I think Pope Francis is what we needed and we're [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6314.72s)]
*  just very happy to be here. And many of his social views, many of his political views, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6320.32s)]
*  were for example he was very much a voice of migrants and dispossessed of course there's a [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6324.96s)]
*  lot of focus on migration at the moment in America from Mexico. Do Mexicans feel that he was kind of [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6331.759999999999s)]
*  standing up for you, he was a voice for you as a nation in many ways? I think the pope was a voice [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6338.799999999999s)]
*  for everyone and I think that's what he wanted right he wanted to be a voice for the people that [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6343.84s)]
*  maybe did not have a voice and that's what he represented. Macarena what does it feel now that [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6348.8s)]
*  he is gone? Does it feel that there is a hole in your lives? Well no I mean I think he did what he [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6354.88s)]
*  had to do and now he's resting and now we're just gonna wait for the conclave to the new pope to [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6361.68s)]
*  come in. And that conclave is likely to begin in the week of the 5th of May a conclave and an [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6368.64s)]
*  elaborate secretive ceremony to choose the next pope. Do you have any any hopes that there could [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6373.2s)]
*  be maybe a Mexican pope to take over? Well whoever who's like the most able to take the place it's [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6379.92s)]
*  gonna be so. Yeah not really I think just like I said before to pray and to to have the best one [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6388.16s)]
*  and to the cardinals are going to be in there to to have the blessing from God and to make the [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6395.679999999999s)]
*  right decision and we're just very hopeful for the new pope. Do you hope that the next pope would be [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6400.64s)]
*  in the same image of Francis in a sense a more progressive wing of the church or do you feel I [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6407.12s)]
*  mean do you do you do you do you fear that it could swing back in an in a different direction? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6412.8s)]
*  I think I'm not qualified enough to to give my opinion in that regard some people that are very [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6418.160000000001s)]
*  very qualified and have the grace of God will make that decision and whatever happens will be for the [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6423.6s)]
*  best. Macarena how important will it be for you to to go inside that basilica I understand that [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6427.76s)]
*  you know it's it's going to be logistically quite difficult with with thousands of people trying to [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6433.76s)]
*  get in today but but can you sort of picture a little bit how you might feel as you're going [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6437.84s)]
*  through and seeing seeing him in his in his open coffin? Well it's going to be a lot of emotions [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6442.96s)]
*  but I'm just I would just be really happy to be there and pay my respects. Macarena and Luis once [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6448.8s)]
*  again congratulations to you both and I hope that you have a happy rest of your honeymoon and I hope [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6455.12s)]
*  you get in to be able to see Pope Francis in his open coffin. Thank you very much for talking to [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6460.8s)]
*  us today. So there are going to be very big crowds who will go in right through the day today you [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6465.2s)]
*  can see already there are crowds lining up here with the Italian police the Carabinieri keeping [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6471.5199999999995s)]
*  guard and then of course it will be a huge security apparatus in place for Saturday with the likes of [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6477.04s)]
*  President Trump, President Macron of France, the Brazilian President, Siqueir Starmer, British Prime [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6482.96s)]
*  Minister already confirming their attendance at the funeral. Then there will be nine days of morning [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6488.8s)]
*  and we are expecting the conclave that process that many of you will be familiar with not least [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6494.96s)]
*  from the Oscar-nominated film with Ralph Fiennes and Stanley Tucci. That process will begin likely [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6499.6s)]
*  to be the week of the 5th of May as we will wait we'll be back here on St Peter's Square waiting [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6505.12s)]
*  for the white smoke from the Vatican to say that they have chosen the successor to Pope Francis. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6509.76s)]
*  We're going to speak to Tabitha Smith Catholic journalist for the Catholic magazine at the [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6515.76s)]
*  Tablet. Thank you for coming on the program. Hi thank you. As we just see these pictures there [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6520.400000000001s)]
*  of those thousands of people that will over the next couple of days file past the body of Pope [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6525.2s)]
*  Francis just talk us through the significance of this moment. I mean it is an incredibly mournful [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6532.0s)]
*  time but it is wonderful to see how many Catholics and non-Catholics are turning out to [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6537.04s)]
*  to pay their respects. I think you know looking at the footage from this morning I was really [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6542.96s)]
*  struck by that antithetical image of Pope Francis during Covid. You know praying alone in St Peter's [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6548.64s)]
*  Square for the world and now after he's passed the whole world has turned up to see him and I think [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6556.08s)]
*  that's just indicative of how of such an amazing pope he was that he really touched people's hearts. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6562.32s)]
*  Yeah talk us through what you made and what stood out for you with the ceremony this morning the [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6568.96s)]
*  moving of the body from the chapel in his residence through St Peter's Square and into [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6574.799999999999s)]
*  a position there in St Peter's Basilica. I think you could tell that the crowd and the procession [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6581.679999999999s)]
*  was just full of huge respect for Francis even down to his you know the his coffin you know a [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6588.4s)]
*  very simple woodlined coffin and I think he kept that humility all the way to the end. I'm sure I [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6595.04s)]
*  was in Rome for Pope Benedict's when when he put Benedict lay in state and that of course was still [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6604.799999999999s)]
*  a mournful time but still very respectful time and I'm sure that those you know thousands of people [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6610.5599999999995s)]
*  over the next few days are turning up to see Pope Francis will be showing the same respect. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6616.96s)]
*  And during his time as the pope he was very popular amongst certain quarters of course [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6623.84s)]
*  far less popular and criticized amongst others but let's focus for a moment just on young people. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6628.88s)]
*  What do you think his influence was there? I think Pope Francis was so important to young Catholics. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6634.4s)]
*  I mean I was 10 years old when when Pope Francis became pope in 2013 and through that time he's [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6641.28s)]
*  walked together with us as young people. He has shown us how to be compassionate, he's shown us [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6650.32s)]
*  how to care for the environment and to not be afraid to speak out for social justice. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6656.0s)]
*  And those issues because of course he faced criticism on any well pick any issue [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6663.92s)]
*  the environment, the role of women, gay people, the handling of the child sex abuse scandals [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6672.5599999999995s)]
*  throughout the church throughout the world. There will always be the more progressive side of the [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6679.04s)]
*  church criticized him for not going far enough for the more conservative wing criticized him for [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6683.599999999999s)]
*  going too far. What's your general stance? I think a lot of people like to criticize the pope like [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6688.64s)]
*  you say for doing either too much or too little and we have to remember that the pope is just [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6697.4400000000005s)]
*  one man and obviously he comes into the papacy with his own views and whoever the next [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6703.04s)]
*  successor will be will also have their own views and might change things. We have to remember that [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6709.360000000001s)]
*  if people are criticized Francis for not going too far too little, we're not in his position, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6715.36s)]
*  we were not in his position so it's difficult for us to criticize him. I think if any of us [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6721.92s)]
*  were in the position of the pope we would be feeling the same stresses. I think the main thing [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6727.04s)]
*  that's a comfort to a lot of Catholics is that the spirit is leading the discernment of the [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6732.639999999999s)]
*  church and it's course and I hope that the spirit continues to work through the coming weeks [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6738.48s)]
*  and into the conclave and the election of the new pope and that's a really important factor. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6746.959999999999s)]
*  Let's just spend a moment on that then. What will you be hoping for from the next pope? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6754.0s)]
*  I think Francis has built a very firm foundation in terms of standing up for [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6760.16s)]
*  for the marginalized groups and vulnerable people and also creating a foundation of [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6766.8s)]
*  compassion and love and I hope that the next pope builds upon that. I think Francis has [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6773.04s)]
*  set the standard for a modern pope and I think whoever will be the new pope has a lot to live [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6781.12s)]
*  up to in that respect. I mean Francis touched so many hearts and I'm sure that whoever the next [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6787.36s)]
*  pope will be will be feeling that pressure but I'm sure that he will be guided by the spirit and [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6794.24s)]
*  ultimately will be successful. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6799.68s)]
*  you [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6854.16s)]
*  you [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6884.16s)]
*  you [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6914.32s)]
*  ì  [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6931.04s)]
*  Hello, welcome to the programme. In the past few hours the body of the late Pope Francis [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6944.16s)]
*  has been moved from the chapel at his residence, Casa Santa Marta, where he chose to live, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6963.24s)]
*  to St Peter's Basilica where it will remain lying in state until the funeral on Saturday. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6969.34s)]
*  The Pope died on Easter Monday at the age of 88. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6974.42s)]
*  The church bells toll as the procession of cardinals and priests accompany the open coffin [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6984.360000000001s)]
*  short distance from the chapel through the city state. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6990.26s)]
*  These are the live pictures where you can see crowds queuing to pay their final respects [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=6996.08s)]
*  to the late Pontiff. The body of Pope Francis will remain there until the funeral on Saturday, [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7001.08s)]
*  which will be attended by leaders from around the world. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7005.96s)]
*  Earlier my colleague Mark Lowen spoke to people at the Vatican who have come to pay their [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7009.32s)]
*  respects. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7013.76s)]
*  It's been a busy morning as you can imagine here on St Peter's Square. Thousands of people [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7014.76s)]
*  waiting by the barrier to catch a glimpse of the Basilica behind me and the procession [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7021.32s)]
*  into the main door of the Basilica with the coffin of Pope Francis which is now lying [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7026.639999999999s)]
*  before the altar of the Confession inside the Basilica under which is believed to be [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7033.5199999999995s)]
*  the tomb of St Peter. Remember each Pope is elected to be the successor to St Peter and [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7039.88s)]
*  That is where the open coffin of Pope Francis will lie now until Saturday morning when the [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7048.76s)]
*  funeral begins and they are expecting tens of thousands of people every day to go into [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7054.96s)]
*  the Basilica until midnight every day until Friday evening at 7pm when the Basilica will [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7060.4400000000005s)]
*  be closed before that funeral on Saturday, a funeral which is going to attract heads [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7066.240000000001s)]
*  of states and world leaders from right across the globe. And then of course Pope Francis [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7071.620000000001s)]
*  will be buried on the other side of Rome at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. It is [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7077.8s)]
*  more than a century since a Pope was buried outside the Vatican and that is very much [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7082.400000000001s)]
*  a sign of how Pope Francis wanted a more humble, more simple end to his life. Well, two of [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7088.66s)]
*  those who are hoping to go inside the Basilica to catch a final glimpse of the Pope are Craig [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7095.88s)]
*  and Paula who are over from Australia and they were here on holiday and then saw the [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7101.6s)]
*  news, heard the news that the Pope had died. Craig, just give me a sense of your reaction [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7108.6s)]
*  when you heard that news. Well, we weren't surprised I have to say because we knew he [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7113.54s)]
*  had been very ill but we were here on the Sunday service when he spent some time on [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7119.660000000001s)]
*  the balcony and we were staying in a hotel only a few metres away and we heard the bells [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7123.8s)]
*  ringing at 7.35 in the morning. We thought that was a little odd and then we looked on [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7128.6s)]
*  the news and we found out that he passed away overnight which was very ironic or bizarre [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7132.6s)]
*  in a way because we'd only just seen him the night before on the balcony and he seemed [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7137.6s)]
*  okay. He seemed okay but seemed frail as he wished people a happy Easter. Yeah, very much [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7142.6s)]
*  but to learn that he died of a secondary illness rather than pneumonia was interesting but [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7147.6s)]
*  not surprising. Paula, I know you are Catholic so how did you feel not just in terms of losing [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7155.6s)]
*  a world leader but also I suppose your spiritual connection to him? Well, I guess I'm not a [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7163.120000000001s)]
*  practicing Catholic but I guess being here I'm swept up in the emotions of things and [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7167.84s)]
*  it's brought back some memories of my childhood, my schooling so yeah and it's definitely [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7173.4800000000005s)]
*  been a diversion from our holiday. I've made Craig come along to some of these events [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7181.28s)]
*  and particularly because of Easter Sunday service we came for that not knowing that [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7188.48s)]
*  that was on as well and so we got out of our holiday and came to be here for that service [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7194.639999999999s)]
*  and again today seeing different people, the type of worship and yeah just being amongst [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7201.639999999999s)]
*  these people I never leave. What did you make of Pope Francis? How did he strike you? A [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7207.92s)]
*  caring humble man. We only found out yesterday because we were actually in there which again [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7214.36s)]
*  is our tour guide spoke to us and mentioned something about his accommodation where he [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7220.4s)]
*  wanted to live rather than wanting to live in something more elaborate. He'd asked to [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7226.4s)]
*  live in the guest house. We thought that straight away that matched what we'd heard about him [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7233.48s)]
*  over the years about his kindness and maybe that he believed in being that kind of kind [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7242.0s)]
*  person. What about his social views, slightly more progressive on the more moderate side [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7253.5599999999995s)]
*  let's say of the Catholic Church. Paul, how did that chime with your views? It certainly [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7260.72s)]
*  did. I'm hoping, we were talking earlier, we're hoping that they vote in another liberal [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7266.4800000000005s)]
*  cardinal to follow in the teachings that he's been adapting to the modern world. They may [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7272.240000000001s)]
*  go more conservative and I think we're quite interested in how that plays out but we very [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7277.6s)]
*  much respected the inclusive nature of some of his teachings and his reinterpretation [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7283.34s)]
*  of some of the Catholic doctrine over the past few years. He's appointed about 80% of [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7288.5199999999995s)]
*  those cardinals who will choose the next Pope so it is thought likely that it will be somebody [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7294.48s)]
*  who is more on that wing of the Church, the Francis wing of the Church but of course one [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7300.92s)]
*  never knows. Paula, what has been the reaction in Australia actually and also the reaction [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7304.599999999999s)]
*  from the Australian Government? Not so much on the Government but part of how we found [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7310.16s)]
*  out which again was quite ironic. When we were walking around Rome it was actually Craig's [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7315.84s)]
*  sister who sent us a message. We didn't know that the Pope had passed so she sent us a [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7322.56s)]
*  text message and said what is it like in Rome? Have you heard the news? And assumed that [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7329.2s)]
*  we had and she was the one that contacted us and actually let us know what had happened. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7334.12s)]
*  Have you heard about mourning or masses back in Australia for example? No, not at this [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7341.32s)]
*  stage. No, but our current Prime Minister is an Italian Catholic of heritage and they're [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7347.68s)]
*  in an election campaign so I think they're fairly focused on that coming up and they [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7352.88s)]
*  may not make the trip over unfortunately for the funeral. How important will it be for [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7357.62s)]
*  you to go inside the Basilica to say a final farewell to the Pope? The idea of going in [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7362.24s)]
*  perhaps tonight, you know, before midnight, yeah I think it is important. I'm hoping Craig [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7368.52s)]
*  will join me to be part of this. It's a very significant moment in history. That was Mark [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7375.040000000001s)]
*  Lauren there asking the questions. Now Pope Francis never returned to his native Argentina [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7384.080000000001s)]
*  where he served as the Archbishop of Buenos Aires during his papacy but he left a legacy [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7389.72s)]
*  there of being someone who helped the most vulnerable. Our South America correspondent [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7395.3s)]
*  Irony Wells reports. Etched into this city's streets and the memories of its people as [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7399.4400000000005s)]
*  their Archbishop, as an advocate for the poor, as one of them, this message is a sentiment [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7410.74s)]
*  many here share. He reminded people that in the church there is room for everyone, everyone, [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7417.74s)]
*  everyone. This cathedral in Buenos Aires has opened its doors for mourners here to write [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7426.5599999999995s)]
*  a final message to him or simply to offer their prayers. Many of them have praised his [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7435.5599999999995s)]
*  work helping the poor from the country's soup kitchens to its prisons. He is well known [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7442.14s)]
*  for his action towards the most humble people from different places. In everyday life he [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7448.58s)]
*  was very close to ordinary people. It is a source of pride because he is the first Pope [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7454.14s)]
*  not only from Argentina but from Latin America. I hope his legacy continues. The church was [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7459.78s)]
*  not the only community he dedicated a lifetime to. Another was San Lorenzo, his local football [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7467.679999999999s)]
*  club. His fans say his commitment lasted until the end. His membership card number was his [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7475.36s)]
*  age 88 and the local time that he died in Argentina, 235. Imagine that the first Archbishop [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7482.4s)]
*  from Argentina is also a member of your club. For us it was an important honour and for [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7490.4s)]
*  him it was a pleasure, something he wanted to do in his life. His father was a basketball [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7497.9s)]
*  player for San Lorenzo so he inherited his fandom for the club. His views, his outspokenness, [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7503.7s)]
*  his criticism of some politicians made him a divisive figure but one thing that unites [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7510.46s)]
*  everyone in this country is their memory of him as a local who grew up in this house in [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7514.86s)]
*  the city close to the people that he served. His funeral will be a global event but here [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7519.34s)]
*  the grief is distinctly Argentine. Ioni Wells, BBC News in Buenos Aires. In around 14 days [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7526.28s)]
*  the process by which the Catholic Church's cardinals choose a new pontiff will begin. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7534.16s)]
*  Some have already arrived in Rome for the conclave as it is known which is steeped in [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7539.2s)]
*  tradition and secrecy. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7543.12s)]
*  Conclave, where ritual and art, politics and power come together in total secrecy. The [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7550.0s)]
*  process to decide the next pope will begin in the Sistine Chapel in around two weeks' [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7556.52s)]
*  time beneath Michelangelo's extraordinary ceiling. The doors are locked, communication [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7561.68s)]
*  severed. And the 135 cardinals under 80 and entitled to vote swear an oath of silence. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7567.0s)]
*  The first rule of conclave is you do not talk about conclave. I wonder if I could have a [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7574.5s)]
*  word in private. The Oscar-winning movie Conclave released six months ago painstakingly recreated [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7583.5s)]
*  the papal election process as the backdrop for a story of raw politics in red robes. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7589.5s)]
*  This is a conclave Aldo, it's not a war. It is a war. It won't be quite like that but [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7595.7s)]
*  there might be Francis' progressive ideas or will more traditional voices hold sway. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7602.200000000001s)]
*  Among three English cardinals with a vote Vincent Nichols advises to expect the unexpected. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7608.200000000001s)]
*  It's always a surprise. While the film the Conclave obviously made great drama of this, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7614.64s)]
*  it will be far more an exercise of corporate discernment and trusting in the promptings [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7621.92s)]
*  of this Holy Spirit to give us what we need. 80% of those voting in the Conclave were appointed [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Hqq3OaaG8&t=7629.86s)]
