Video Description: European leaders have urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine starting on Monday.
 
The call was issued at a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" in Kyiv. 
 
The leaders of France, Germany, the UK and Poland were hosted by Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, while others joined remotely.
 
They made the announcement after discussing the plan by phone with US President Donald Trump - who initially mooted an unconditional ceasefire. The leaders threatened Russia with "massive" sanctions if it does not comply.
 
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the aim of the coalition of the willing was to show "that aggression will never prevail on our continent".

# European leaders pressure Russia over 30-day Ukraine ceasefire | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4)
*  The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland have agreed on Saturday to an unconditional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=0.0s)]
*  30-day ceasefire from 12 May with the backing of US President Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=4.24s)]
*  They also threatened President Vladimir Putin with new massive sanctions if he failed to comply. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=9.52s)]
*  The announcement was made by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Ukraine [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=15.36s)]
*  after a meeting in Kyiv during which they held a phone call with Mr Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=20.48s)]
*  Our chief political correspondent Henry Zefferman is following the visit to Kyiv. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=25.36s)]
*  This is a visit that's been drenched in symbolism, coming as it does at the end of a week where [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=30.4s)]
*  we've been commemorating the end of war in Europe. These are European leaders visiting a war in Europe. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=35.2s)]
*  It's also a symbolic response to the world leaders who joined Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=41.12s)]
*  But over the course of this morning it's become clear that Sir Keir Starmer and his fellow leaders [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=46.56s)]
*  are trying to do more than just the symbolic. They are trying to extract an agreement for a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=50.72s)]
*  30-day ceasefire from Russia. They've just held a virtual call of the so-called Coalition of the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=55.12s)]
*  Willing. After that they phoned up Donald Trump. All involved, including the US President, support [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  that proposal. But does Vladimir Putin? Because if he doesn't, the accusation may be that this is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=66.16s)]
*  just yet more symbolism. Henry Zefferman, well those European leaders have been giving a press [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=72.16s)]
*  conference after their meetings and here's what President Zelensky said. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=78.0s)]
*  We are working on various levels with the United States of America and Ukraine has very productive [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=81.28s)]
*  dialogue with President Trump and the connection with the team and we are grateful for that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=88.24s)]
*  And we thank the teams of the leaders and all those present here who are personally working [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=94.88s)]
*  and in constant touch with the United States of America. The partners are in permanent communication [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=103.36s)]
*  with Washington. We've just spoken together with the President Trump and we have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=108.72s)]
*  agreed our joint view, our further steps. A full and unconditional ceasefire is much needed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=117.92s)]
*  The accountability for refusal is needed. We can together lay the foundation for peace and I thank [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=124.0s)]
*  everybody who supports the dignified end to this war. Well the UK Prime Minister [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=132.8s)]
*  Sarkis Stamos said today's announcement showed that Europe was stepping up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=139.44s)]
*  All of us here together with the US are calling Putin out. If he's serious about peace then he [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  has a chance to show it now by extending the V-Day pause into a full unconditional 30-day [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=154.8s)]
*  ceasefire with negotiations to follow immediately once a ceasefire is agreed. No more ifs and buts, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  no more conditions and delays. Putin didn't need conditions when he wanted a ceasefire to have a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  parade and he doesn't need them now. Ukraine has shown the willingness to engage again and again [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=180.96s)]
*  but again and again Putin has refused. So we are clear, all five leaders here, all the leaders on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=190.8s)]
*  the meeting we just had with the coalition of the willing, an unconditional ceasefire, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=200.08s)]
*  rejecting Putin's conditions and clear that if he turns his back on peace we will respond. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=206.48s)]
*  Working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=216.48s)]
*  our military aid for Ukraine's defence to pressure Russia back to the table. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  Sarkis Stamos, let's speak to Jim Townsend, former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=230.4s)]
*  for European and NATO Policy. Mr Townsend, thank you very much for joining us here on BBC News. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=235.04s)]
*  How hopeful are you that this is going to lead to a ceasefire on Monday? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=241.2s)]
*  Well I think it's the, I'm hopeful only because this is the biggest push that I think we have [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=246.0s)]
*  made with the US and with the European leaders to include threatening sanctions or additional [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=252.48s)]
*  assistance to Ukraine if the Russians don't come to the table. So in terms of a push, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=259.92s)]
*  in terms of who's involved, and Trump sounds like he's quite involved over the phone [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  with the leadership and with Zelensky, this is the biggest attempt and so let's see if it works. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  We saw though in Moscow with the Victory Day commemorations marking 80 years since World War [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=275.44s)]
*  II ended in Europe that China, Venezuela, Vienna, Russia, Slovakia are all present. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=283.28s)]
*  Vladimir Putin isn't as isolated as we were hearing from our security correspondent as the West would [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=290.79999999999995s)]
*  like. Well he is, he's not as isolated as he had been in the past but the friends he has are not [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=295.76s)]
*  exactly the kinds of friends you'd want to have. Brazil is part of this as well, Venezuela as you [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=305.11999999999995s)]
*  pointed out. I guess I'm not surprised at seeing that but frankly he's not quite out into the open [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=310.24s)]
*  the way he wants to be and he's got a lot of sanctions on him and sanctions to come and there's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=317.68s)]
*  a clock ticking in Moscow in terms of their economy and in terms of their ability to continue [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  to put manpower into the meat grinder if you will of Ukraine. So I think Putin does not have as much [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=328.72s)]
*  time as he thinks he does. We've seen President Trump somewhat flip-flop over Ukraine and how [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=334.96s)]
*  sympathetic he's been at times towards Vladimir Putin. How will he be viewing what's been happening [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=343.68s)]
*  with these European leaders today in Kiev where we hear there is now a consensus of 20 countries? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=349.52s)]
*  That's right and major countries as well. I mean this is NATO and the EU were part of that as well. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=356.32s)]
*  So I think he is looking on this certainly as Europe stepping up. Europe is involved in this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=362.24s)]
*  They've got skin in the game both institutionally as well as the nations themselves. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  They are also threatening sanctions and assistance going to Ukraine if the Russians don't play ball. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=374.16s)]
*  So certainly Trump sees that he's got a good partner across the Atlantic. A partner that he's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=379.6s)]
*  going to need and is going to be helpful and are taking the lead particularly in this instance. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=385.36s)]
*  So my feeling is that this is only going to help the US and the European nations, NATO, the EU to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=390.72s)]
*  work together in the future because I think Trump sees number one he needs it and number two Europe [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  can be effective. Jim Townsend, former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=404.0s)]
*  and NATO policy. Thank you very much for your insights and there's much more on those talks [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  that have been taking place in Ukraine on the BBC News website. There's a live page up and running [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=413.84s)]
*  which will fill you in all of the details of what has come out of that meeting of those leaders. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF2T8P-BP4&t=420.96s)]
