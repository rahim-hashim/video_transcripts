Video Description: US President Donald Trump has said he will follow through with his threat to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with 25% border taxes, known as tariffs, on 1 February.
 
But he added that a decision about whether this would include oil from those countries had not yet been made.
 
Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said the move was aimed to address the large amounts of undocumented migrants and the fentanyl that come across US borders as well as trade deficits with its neighbours.
 
The president also suggested that he was still planning to impose new tariffs on China, which he said earlier this month would be 10%, but did not give any details.

# US ready to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM)
*  To the US, where the self-imposed deadline set by President Trump to introduce trade tariffs on Canada and Mexico is fast closing in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaking on Thursday, the president said that it was yet to be decided if oil would be included in that 25% tariff on imports. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=8.4s)]
*  He said would be coming in on Saturday. This is what he said. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=17.28s)]
*  We'll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=22.0s)]
*  Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=29.0s)]
*  Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=33.8s)]
*  And number three are the massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=37.3s)]
*  And I'll be putting the tariff of 25% on Canada and separately 25% on Mexico. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=44.7s)]
*  And we will really have to do that because we have very big deficits with those countries. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=53.3s)]
*  So those tariffs may or may not rise with time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=58.5s)]
*  So that was President Trump earlier. Will he go through with it? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=61.5s)]
*  Well, here's Sweeta Ramachandran from Artemis Investment Management. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=64.5s)]
*  Well, I think there's no way to know until the actual decision is made. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=68.5s)]
*  The markets have been expecting some form of tariff announcements since Trump was elected. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=72.5s)]
*  To the extent that the Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has requested trade reviews with the US's major trading partners to be ready by the 1st of April. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=77.5s)]
*  But when a more serious and considered enforcement mechanism is expected to take place, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=87.5s)]
*  as to the measures that are expected to come into force tomorrow, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=92.5s)]
*  we're still in the dark about the specifics of some of them because China and sorry, Canada and Mexico are also among the two largest importers of US goods. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=96.5s)]
*  And so they have the ability to retaliate against the US as well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=106.5s)]
*  It also remains unclear because I think in a separate statement, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=110.5s)]
*  President Trump also said that the primary intention of these 25 percent tariffs are actually to curb illegal immigration as well as the import of opioids and specifically fentanyl. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=113.5s)]
*  So in that sense, it's not a traditional trade war since the intention of the primary intention is about these other factors rather than merely the deficits. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZiDVw9-ELM&t=126.5s)]
