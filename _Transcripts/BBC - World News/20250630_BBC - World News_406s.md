# Hundreds of families displaced by wave of Israeli air strikes on Gaza, witnesses say | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM)
*  Let's take you to the Middle East now where a wave of Israeli airstrikes across much of Gaza overnight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=0.0s)]
*  has triggered the displacement of hundreds of Palestinian families. People in Gaza City saying [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  dozens of air raids targeted densely populated eastern neighborhoods. A school was hit in Zaytoun, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=10.24s)]
*  that's an area that was sheltering displaced families. The bombardment follows one of the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  largest evacuation orders issued by Israel since the war with Hamas resumed in March. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=21.12s)]
*  There has been speculation in the Israeli media that some generals consider the military is close [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=26.24s)]
*  to completing its objectives in the Palestinian territory. Let's bring you Wera Davis, he's our [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=31.52s)]
*  Jerusalem correspondent, he's got more now on the latest defense of Israel's latest offensive in Gaza. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=37.28s)]
*  Well several people are reported to have been killed in overnight Israeli airstrikes, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=43.28s)]
*  particularly in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. One resident is said to have described [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=47.68s)]
*  as the most intensive airstrike since the resumption of the war in Gaza back in March [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=53.36s)]
*  after a very short ceasefire. Among those areas targeted last night was a former school in the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=58.72s)]
*  eastern part of Gaza City where several families, hundreds of people are displaced and are sheltering [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=64.64s)]
*  from the war. Several people were reported to have been killed, others were taken to a nearby [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=70.56s)]
*  hospital. One woman is reported to have said that she and her family had been moved at least seven [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=75.12s)]
*  times during the course of the war. And all of this comes after a warning from the Israeli [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=80.48s)]
*  military over the weekend to thousands of people, particularly in the north of Gaza, to move because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=85.28s)]
*  of an intensive Israeli military campaign in the area. But the problems say the UN and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=91.04s)]
*  Palestinian agencies is that the areas they're being asked to move to are not considered safe. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  Indeed many people say that nowhere in Gaza can be considered safe at this point. There's speculation [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  now as to what the intentions of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are. He of course [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=108.24s)]
*  is known to have wanted to have continued the war to defeat Hamas militarily but he's under pressure [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  internationally from Donald Trump but also from the families of the hostages in Israel to try and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=120.24s)]
*  reach a ceasefire deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages and finally bring an end [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  to this war. But it's still too early to say what will happen over the next few days and if those [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=132.0s)]
*  ceasefire talks will resume. Let's talk more about the possibility of ceasefire talks with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=136.88s)]
*  Sultan Barakat who's Professor of Public Policy at Hamad bin Khalifa University, also a Senior [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Associate Fellow at the Security Think Tank, RUCI. Sultan, very good to see you. Before we get into [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=148.96s)]
*  that though I have just been sent the latest from the Hamas-run Health Ministry of deaths and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  injuries in the last 24 hours which I'd like to bring to people. 28 people killed and 223 injuries [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=161.44000000000003s)]
*  arriving at Gaza's hospitals during the past 24 hours as a result of the IDF offensive. But [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=168.8s)]
*  Sultan firstly what do you make of these reports coming out of Israel? Military sources say they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  are close to wrapping up their ground offensive. Well I mean to be honest they've run out of targets [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  there's nothing left in Gaza and the military commanders have expressed repeatedly the fact [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=190.0s)]
*  that they're becoming more vulnerable by operating from within Gaza than before. So their soldiers [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=196.88s)]
*  are now being targeted and we saw the last two weeks the number of casualties amongst the Israeli [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=204.0s)]
*  soldiers is greater so there is no direct benefit from them being operating within Gaza. The [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  difficulty here is that Netanyahu and his coalition government they're still pursuing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=216.08s)]
*  the objective of defeating Hamas and releasing the captives and that objective has simply proven [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  impossible as you cannot defeat Hamas the way he understands that and I think now coming out of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=230.96s)]
*  the 12-day war with Iran he must feel very frustrated that he could not achieve his objectives in Iran [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  either and maybe frustrated also by the way Trump has reacted to that scenario. So he's now taking [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=243.92s)]
*  his anger on the Palestinians and it continues. The objective will remain as far as he's concerned [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=252.72s)]
*  is to displace the Palestinians and the more bombing that takes place the more uninhabitable [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=260.24s)]
*  the land is and he makes it much more possible for an ultimate agenda that he really wants to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=266.4s)]
*  push ahead with and that is to displace them out of Gaza. What about the possibility of a ceasefire [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  then? US officials in Washington today as always there are mediators in Cairo and in Doha as well [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=281.44s)]
*  there are these key sticking points that remain but does it feel like a ceasefire could be any closer? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=290.08s)]
*  Well I think it's in the interest of Trump in particular to bring an end to this conflict. He [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=296.4s)]
*  has invested a great deal over the last few months in the Arab world particularly in the Gulf states [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  you know two billions of dollars are at stake at the moment he does not want that to be at risk. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  He would like to see an end of the war in Gaza and he must be now pushing for that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=315.84s)]
*  Maybe something similar to the way he ended the conflict with Iran could be at play [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=324.8s)]
*  but I personally suspect that Netanyahu will play for time. He will delay things as much as possible [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=332.24s)]
*  until he visits Washington again where he can put on an act similar to the one he did this time last [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=338.8s)]
*  year in July I think 24th of July 2024 where he will go and try and play the congress and the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  Israeli lobby in Washington and place more pressure on the Trump administration to further [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=353.36s)]
*  support his objective. He's not going to rest until he sees the Palestinians out of Gaza and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=359.04s)]
*  this is unfortunately driven both by his ideology extreme ideology but also by the need for him to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=364.56s)]
*  survive politically. Any less achievement in Gaza will lead to the collapse of his government [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=371.6s)]
*  which relies entirely on his very fragile coalition with the extreme settlers. So [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=381.84s)]
*  it's likely that even if they engage in talks Netanyahu will drag those talks on until he [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=389.36s)]
*  visits Washington DC. Sultan good to get your thoughts thank you for joining us Sultan Barakat [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH35W_1ySPM&t=396.96s)]
