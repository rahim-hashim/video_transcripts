Video Description: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a ceasefire in Gaza has been delayed until Hamas releases a list of hostages.

A statement from his office says he instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) not to begin the ceasefire, which was scheduled to take effect at 8:30 local time (06:30 GMT).

Hamas says the delay is due to "technical field reasons".

The Israeli leader warned last night that the first phase of the deal to stop fighting in Gaza was “a temporary ceasefire”, and that Israel reserved the right to resume the war, with US backing, if it was to break down.

# Israel says Gaza ceasefire delayed until Hamas provides list of hostages | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c)
*  So I can tell you at 8.30 in the morning here in Israel, wherever [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=0.0s)]
*  you're watching or listening to us, that the ceasefire appears to have [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=5.0s)]
*  been delayed. The ceasefire that was supposed to come into force right [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=10.0s)]
*  now in Gaza, ending 15 months of fighting. This latest conflict of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=15.0s)]
*  this chapter, of course, which started on the 7th of October, where [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=21.0s)]
*  more than 1,200 people were murdered here in Israel by Hamas militants [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=25.0s)]
*  and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants who came out of Gaza and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=29.0s)]
*  took hostages, and then, of course, that bitter war which followed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=33.0s)]
*  The Hamas run health ministry saying that more than 46,000 people in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=37.0s)]
*  Gaza have lost their lives in the last 470 days or so. There has been [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=41.0s)]
*  a very complex and very difficult ceasefire agreement, which has [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=47.0s)]
*  taken months to actually put into effect. Joe Biden, the outgoing US [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=51.0s)]
*  president, said it's very much based on the framework that he put [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=55.0s)]
*  forward in May of last year and is only now, in January of the following [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=58.0s)]
*  year, supposed to be coming into effect. But the breaking news that I [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=62.0s)]
*  can bring you as you're joining us here this morning live in Israel is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=66.0s)]
*  that that ceasefire appears to have been delayed. We're waiting to hear [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=70.0s)]
*  from the Israel defence forces. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=74.0s)]
*  office said that they would be instructed not to begin this ceasefire [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=78.0s)]
*  if the list had not been provided by Hamas. Hamas has said just in the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=83.0s)]
*  last few minutes that it has reaffirmed its commitment to the terms of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=87.0s)]
*  the ceasefire. They say that the delay in providing the names of those [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=90.0s)]
*  due to be released in the first batch is due to technical field reasons. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=95.0s)]
*  So now it is, again, an incredibly difficult moment. Even as this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=100.0s)]
*  ceasefire agreement was supposed to be happening, it has already been [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=103.0s)]
*  delayed. Let's bring in our chief international correspondent, Lise [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=107.0s)]
*  Doucet. Lise, we should say first of all, since you and I came here and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=110.0s)]
*  covered the beginning of this story 470 days ago, it has been a time of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=115.0s)]
*  extraordinary suffering for Israelis and for Palestinians and so many [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=120.0s)]
*  people on both sides were desperate for this moment, desperate for this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=124.0s)]
*  ceasefire agreement to begin successfully. Yes, Anna, perhaps these [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=128.0s)]
*  last minute issues, these delays, which hopefully will be limited, are not [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=136.0s)]
*  surprising given the complexity of this deal, given the devastation on the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=141.0s)]
*  ground in Gaza, which we have been able to report about even though [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=146.0s)]
*  international journalists are still not allowed to go there to report [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=150.0s)]
*  independently. Palestinian colleagues have been doing that. But even though [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=153.0s)]
*  they may not be surprising, they are agonizing. As we know, it is often [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=157.0s)]
*  the case that these last minutes before something momentous is about to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=162.0s)]
*  happen that can seem like hours, that can seem like days. The people of the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=167.0s)]
*  Gaza Strip, the Palestinians, the families of the loved ones held [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=173.0s)]
*  hostage in Gaza have lived through a nightmare in the last 15 months and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=178.0s)]
*  they were daring to hope that this time, unlike in November where, as you [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=183.0s)]
*  remember, you covered it as well, the temporary truce broke down very [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=188.0s)]
*  quickly after more than about 100 hostages were released in exchange for [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=192.0s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. There was a moment of calm, blissful calm. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=196.0s)]
*  This time they're hoping that this will be not just a long and sustainable [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=202.0s)]
*  ceasefire, the sustainable calm, that's the term that is used in the deal that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=206.0s)]
*  was signed after months and months of protracted negotiations. But they want [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=212.0s)]
*  an end to this war. But for the moment, Anna, we are focusing on this waiting [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=217.0s)]
*  for it to start, for that moment where they can believe that something good [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=223.0s)]
*  will come out of this deal. But as you've been reporting, it is, while there [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=229.0s)]
*  is cautious hope, this moment is also fraught with risk that it will so [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=234.0s)]
*  quickly unravel. And across Israel, across Palestinian territories, capitals, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=239.0s)]
*  across this region and around the world, they're waiting with bated breath, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=244.0s)]
*  hoping that this deal will hold, except of course for the critics of this deal, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=249.0s)]
*  the spoilers. And they are many. There are many who want to believe that after [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=254.0s)]
*  the first phase that this will all fall apart, including members, the far [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=259.0s)]
*  right wing members, Prime Minister Netanyahu's sub-cabinet. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=263.0s)]
*  We heard yesterday, one of the key far right members of that coalition [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=269.0s)]
*  taking his Jewish party, Jewish power party, out of the coalition, as you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=276.0s)]
*  say. There's been a lot of objections to that deal here in Israel. We are [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=281.0s)]
*  hearing from rear Admiral Daniel Higari, who we have heard from many [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=286.0s)]
*  times before from the Israel defence forces. We know that Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=290.0s)]
*  has said that he would not be able to begin the ceasefire if that list had [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=295.0s)]
*  not been handed across. Hamas said that they were committed to the ceasefire, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=299.0s)]
*  that it was technical reasons that had delayed that handover. But rear [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=303.0s)]
*  Admiral Daniel Higari confirming that the ceasefire has not taken effect, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=307.0s)]
*  as long as Hamas says it is not meeting its obligations, it won't take [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=312.0s)]
*  effect. And in particular, the need to hand over that list of hostages, 33 [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=316.0s)]
*  people have been handed over in that first phase. So, Lisa, as we are [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=321.0s)]
*  looking at live pictures here of the skyline of Gaza, that sort of view [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=326.0s)]
*  that we are very familiar with looking from southern Israel across to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=330.0s)]
*  Gaza, you were reflecting, Lisa, on the complexity of that deal, the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=334.0s)]
*  amount of time that it has taken to actually get to this point, the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=338.0s)]
*  number of conditions that exist within it. What will be happening now as [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=341.0s)]
*  they try and resolve this, because it stumbled, as you say, at the very [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=345.0s)]
*  first hurdle? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=349.0s)]
*  Well, this phrase that is used by Hamas, technical field difficulties, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=353.0s)]
*  this is something which has plagued the negotiations for a very long time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=357.0s)]
*  Israel used to accuse Hamas of playing tricks, of trying to deceive them, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=361.0s)]
*  because they couldn't actually say how many hostages were alive, how many [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=366.0s)]
*  hostages were dead, because in that scramble, in that there was atrocious [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=370.0s)]
*  hours, horrific attacks by Hamas at dawn on October the Saturday, October [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=375.0s)]
*  the 7th, 2023. It wasn't just Hamas that grabbed hostages, it was soldiers [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=380.0s)]
*  and civilians, including babies, infants, and rapes dashing across the border [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=385.0s)]
*  to Gaza with them. There was also the Islamic Jihad group and also [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=391.0s)]
*  civilians from Gaza who just basically seized this opportunity. And so [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=396.0s)]
*  throughout the past 15 months Hamas has been trying to, in the midst of this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=401.0s)]
*  blistering war, has been trying to find out where the hostages are, how [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=406.0s)]
*  difficult it will be to get access to them, are they alive? Obviously there's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=410.0s)]
*  been much more clarity as these negotiations came to the final point, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=414.0s)]
*  those last days, where they said they were almost there. They came up with [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=418.0s)]
*  this list of 33 on this list, as we've been reporting. This is children, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=422.0s)]
*  women, female soldiers, possibly men under the age of 40. The male soldiers [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=427.0s)]
*  will be left to the final stages. And it had seemed that they did know, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=432.0s)]
*  although they didn't make clear on this list, who is alive and who is dead. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=436.0s)]
*  And this has just magnified the agony for the families of the hostages who are [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=441.0s)]
*  dead. And so they have been trying to find out who is alive and who is [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=446.0s)]
*  dead. And so this has magnified the agony for the families of the hostages [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=452.0s)]
*  who are desperate, who have lived without any information except for these [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=457.0s)]
*  horrible videos, these proof of life videos that have sometimes emerged from [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=462.0s)]
*  Hamas. We can only speculate now, Anna, is it because they can't get access to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=467.0s)]
*  certain areas? Is the handover from one group to another not proceeding? Have [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=472.0s)]
*  obviously Hamas also is doing this, worried about their own safety. They have [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=477.0s)]
*  to emerge from the shadows. We do know, though, that they do get help in these, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=481.0s)]
*  the International Committee of the Red Cross, local organisations. Everyone is [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=486.0s)]
*  poised. And we can only hope, Anna, that this is just a matter of moment, just [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=491.0s)]
*  some last hitches. There's nothing to suggest that it is anything more than [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=496.0s)]
*  that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=501.0s)]
*  Thank you, Anna, for your time. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=502.0s)]
*  Our chief international correspondent, Lise Doucette, I want to take you to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=507.0s)]
*  the occupied West Bank. John Donison is there. John, how is this delay being [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=512.0s)]
*  received by Palestinians where you are? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=517.0s)]
*  Well, it's an agonising wait. Because what the Palestinian Prisoners [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=520.0s)]
*  Association is saying here is that they still don't have a concrete list of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=524.0s)]
*  the 90 or so Palestinian prisoners who are expected to be freed today. So you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=530.0s)]
*  still have families waiting if their loved ones are going to be coming out [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=535.0s)]
*  of prison. And for those prisoners, I mean, Palestinians regard them as [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=540.0s)]
*  hostages, as bargaining chips being held by Israel in the same way that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=544.0s)]
*  Israel regards the people being held by Hamas as hostages. So, you know, they [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=549.0s)]
*  are going to be waiting all day, and we still don't really have any clarity of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=554.0s)]
*  how this process is going to work today, how they're going to be brought out [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=559.0s)]
*  of prison, where they're going to be taken to. Some are going to be deported [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=564.0s)]
*  out of Israel, Palestine, to neighbouring countries, to Turkey, to Qatar. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=569.0s)]
*  Some are going to be deported back to Gaza. So, yes, like everywhere, people [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=574.0s)]
*  are still waiting. And, you know, the thing that is just so tragic, really, is [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=579.0s)]
*  that it seems right up to this ceasefire, hopefully coming into effect, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=584.0s)]
*  people are probably still dying. We've seen those airstrikes in Gaza this [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=589.0s)]
*  morning. Certainly in the last few days, there have been scores of people [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=594.0s)]
*  killed in Gaza in Israeli strikes. And with some sort of calm in sight, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=599.0s)]
*  those people are not going to see it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=604.0s)]
*  John, thank you, John Donison, our correspondent there, just showing you [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=611.0s)]
*  some live images that we're seeing as well from Khajn Unis in Gaza, people [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=616.0s)]
*  there obviously coming together, getting news of the delay. If you're [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=621.0s)]
*  just joining us this morning on BBC Breakfast, the BBC News Channel or [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=625.0s)]
*  BBC Five Live, wherever you're watching or listening, we're bringing you [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=629.0s)]
*  the breaking news this morning that that ceasefire has not gone into effect [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=633.0s)]
*  and that the ceasefire has not gone into effect. We've heard the sound of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=637.0s)]
*  car horns in Gaza. Israel says that it has not received, as it was supposed [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=642.0s)]
*  to under the terms of this deal, a definitive list of those 33 hostages [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=646.0s)]
*  who are due to be released in the next 42 days or so. They say until that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=650.0s)]
*  comes that this ceasefire will not begin and that the fighting will continue [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=654.0s)]
*  in Gaza. Of course, people, many people here in Israel and in Gaza have been [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=659.0s)]
*  fighting for this moment and I want to bring in Gil Dickman. Gil, I remember [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=664.0s)]
*  the last time there was a ceasefire, more than a year ago now. You and I, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=668.0s)]
*  we stood here in this same square in Tel Aviv. You, better than anybody, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=672.0s)]
*  understand what this moment is like for those families who are still waiting [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=677.0s)]
*  for their loved ones. Yeah, I know how emotionally tense it is. It's like a [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=682.0s)]
*  rollercoaster because you know you're expecting something good. You know you [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=687.0s)]
*  love one in just a few hours, but everything is at stake because it could [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=692.0s)]
*  all collapse in just one moment. We see it with this delay. We know that the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=697.0s)]
*  next few days are going to be a nightmare for all of us, but it is going [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=701.0s)]
*  to end. And that's another reason why we have to start with it as quickly as [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=705.0s)]
*  possible. Hamas should have given the list already. Give the list. Let's start [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=709.0s)]
*  the negotiation for the next phases of the deal and finish with it as quickly [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=715.0s)]
*  as possible because it's going to be a nightmare for all of us if we don't. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=720.0s)]
*  At moments like this, just share how emotional it is. I mean I can see from [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=724.0s)]
*  looking at you and I know from conversations I've had with you here [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=730.0s)]
*  before how emotional these moments are, particularly for those families who are [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=734.0s)]
*  expecting their loved ones to be in this part of the deal. These moments are [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=738.0s)]
*  agonizing. Yeah, on the one hand you think, oh my God, she might be coming in [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=742.0s)]
*  just a few hours. You start to think about what you're going to get for her. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=747.0s)]
*  You start packing the luggage for the moment she's here. And on the other hand, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=751.0s)]
*  you keep remembering that it all might collapse in just one moment. And that's [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=756.0s)]
*  really agonizing as you said. For all of us, it is bittersweet here today because [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=762.0s)]
*  it's good to see this ceasefire finally on the way, but it's too late already. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=767.0s)]
*  It's too late already for Carmel, who was supposed to be on the list for this very, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=774.0s)]
*  very ceasefire, this very deal. And it's too late for all the hostages here that [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=779.0s)]
*  are still there actually because it doesn't matter even who comes out today. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=785.0s)]
*  There have been 471 days in captivity. That's way, way too long and I don't want [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=791.0s)]
*  to start thinking about what they've been through there. That's all in our minds [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=799.0s)]
*  as families of hostages. That's definitely the minds of the families who are [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=804.0s)]
*  awaiting family members. But the most important thing is that we start because [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=808.0s)]
*  we want this war to end. And what I'm afraid of is that this is only a temporary [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=813.0s)]
*  ceasefire. That we'll see only 33 hostages coming and then the war will resume. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=820.0s)]
*  This is not what we want. We want this ceasefire to start as quickly as possible [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=825.0s)]
*  and then to end this war completely with all 97 hostages coming back home. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=831.0s)]
*  We had one hostage that was right now rescued from Gaza. The body of a hostage, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=838.0s)]
*  actually Oron Shaul, that's been there for 10 years. Three more hostages have been [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=846.0s)]
*  in Gaza for 10 years. We have to get this over with. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=851.0s)]
*  Gil, thank you for joining us. I really appreciate it. I think you speak for [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=854.0s)]
*  many, many people. Not just here in Israel, but in Gaza as well. Palestinians in [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=859.0s)]
*  the Occupy West Bank. We were hearing from John Donison as well. Many, many [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=864.0s)]
*  people really desperate for the ceasefire to take hold and to actually begin the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=868.0s)]
*  end to this 15-month war, 470 days of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, of [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=873.0s)]
*  Palestinians, civilians being displaced, being killed in Gaza. People not just [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=880.0s)]
*  here in the Middle East, but around the world really desperately hoping that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=885.0s)]
*  this happens. I also want to speak to James Elder. James, you have been so [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=888.0s)]
*  involved with the aid effort there in Gaza. You've been there very regularly. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=894.0s)]
*  I know you, like Gil, have had some really emotional moments from what you've [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=899.0s)]
*  seen and heard. You, again, I know, are desperate for this ceasefire to come [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=903.0s)]
*  into effect and that the delay will be agonising as we were hearing there for [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=908.0s)]
*  people here in Israel and for people there in Gaza. Yeah, and look, I've been [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=912.0s)]
*  on the phone ever since this started looking real because so many of these [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=916.0s)]
*  ceasefires have not really, to put those in Gaza, felt like they were going to [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=920.0s)]
*  bring about an end to the killing, an end to the violence. A hostage is going [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=925.0s)]
*  home. This one has. So since Wednesday, including this morning, and people are [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=929.0s)]
*  just desperate. They have lived on hope. But as someone said to me today, we've [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=933.0s)]
*  also absolutely lived on disappointment. So they wait. It is long overdue. We [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=937.0s)]
*  know these hostages should have been home a long time ago. We know thousands [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=942.0s)]
*  and thousands of children did not need to be killed, a hundred killed since the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=946.0s)]
*  start of this year, Anna. So people are there and people are saying to me, look, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=951.0s)]
*  I live in a tent. I will go home to rubble and be in a tent. But I will remove [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=954.0s)]
*  the rubble with my hands. I think people forget, despite this insane devastation [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=960.0s)]
*  and destruction, despite an absence of empathy and absence of respected rules [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=965.0s)]
*  of law, Gazans do rebuild. Gazans have one of the highest literacy rates on the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=969.0s)]
*  planet. And that's because no matter how many crises they've had, parents and [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=975.0s)]
*  grandparents, Anna, always put education first. So these are people who are ready [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=979.0s)]
*  to rebuild, ready to restart, if given a chance. And so as we've heard from all [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=984.0s)]
*  your guests this morning, this cannot be for a week or for a month or for three [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=988.0s)]
*  months. We cannot return to the idea of children being bombed in their homes [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=993.0s)]
*  and being shot by quadcopters. This needs to be sustained. But of course you [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=997.0s)]
*  and I are speaking and we're still waiting. But there is great hope on the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1001.0s)]
*  ground. But it is a population that's seen their hope literally blown away many, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1005.0s)]
*  many times before in the last year and a bit. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1009.0s)]
*  And James, just reminders of the scale of the task ahead in Gaza, because of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1013.0s)]
*  course this is a three-phase ceasefire agreement and the rebuilding, the [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1019.0s)]
*  reconstruction really doesn't come in until phase three. There is so much to be [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1024.0s)]
*  done there, isn't there, from day one to actually rebuilding people's lives? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1028.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's such a critical point, Anna, that the environment that [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1032.0s)]
*  humanitarians need to operate in. So if you look at numbers, almost the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1037.0s)]
*  entirety of the Gaza Strip has been displaced. Displaced meaning violently [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1041.0s)]
*  people are having to leave your home and two thirds of homes being destroyed. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1046.0s)]
*  The capacity of the water system is around 25%. Most of the hospitals are not [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1051.0s)]
*  fully functioning by any stretch of the imagination. Systematic devastation of a [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1055.0s)]
*  healthcare system. We've seen diseases reappear that we hadn't seen. We've seen [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1059.0s)]
*  children dying of hypothermia, children dying of malnutrition. So for UNICEF, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1063.0s)]
*  our first priorities are medicine, is fuel for things like hospitals so doctors [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1068.0s)]
*  can operate with light, so fuel so we can get desalination plants going. It's [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1073.0s)]
*  tents, it's blankets and it's food. But we don't change the operating environment [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1077.0s)]
*  in Gaza, which has been so devastatingly broken with the stroke of a pen. We need [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1082.0s)]
*  those access points, many more access points. We've always said from day one, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1087.0s)]
*  the most efficient, the quickest, the cheapest way to get aid to that long [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1091.0s)]
*  suffering population is through Israel. Those entry points need to open. We need [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1095.0s)]
*  security on the ground. We need roads repaired. We need all the things we have [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1099.0s)]
*  been pleading for that sit under international humanitarian law for more [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1104.0s)]
*  than a year. Those things need to occur and then yes, we can start to flood the Gaza [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1108.0s)]
*  Strip with aid. But when we talk of 600 trucks, which is essential, it's commercial [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1112.0s)]
*  trucks as well, that's a thousand percent increase on where we are now. And where we [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1116.0s)]
*  are now is because of these restrictions, because of security, because of a lack of [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1121.0s)]
*  entry points, because of bureaucratic obstructions. So those things have to be [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1125.0s)]
*  removed. I spoke to someone yesterday and I said I'm happy, not happy. What do we [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1130.0s)]
*  have left? What does it mean? What is the point? We have to show there is a point to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1134.0s)]
*  this. Gazans are ready to respond. Gazans are ready. They've been the front lines [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1139.0s)]
*  for their families, their children, for those working in hospitals volunteering [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1143.0s)]
*  from day one. But for this aid and commercial goods to get there, we need both [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1147.0s)]
*  parties. We particularly need Israel, who controls the entry points and controls [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1151.0s)]
*  that security, to follow the intent of this ceasefire, open everything and allow [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1155.0s)]
*  us to reach a very long-suffering people who really are and have been for a long [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1160.0s)]
*  time and are absolutely on their knees. I think what's key in all of this, James, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1165.0s)]
*  and something that I think is true to say of the conflict across the wider Middle [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1171.0s)]
*  East is that so often these decisions that are being taken by violent armed [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1177.0s)]
*  groups, by politicians, people sitting in rooms, whoever they are, the impact is [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1182.0s)]
*  always so acutely felt on the ground. Whether, as we were hearing, it is [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1187.0s)]
*  hostage families here in Israel waiting desperately for the release of their [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1192.0s)]
*  loved ones, whether it's, as you were saying, displaced Palestinians who have [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1197.0s)]
*  seen family members killed who can't feed their children. This has such a wide [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1201.0s)]
*  range of impact on the world. It's so much more than just a [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1206.0s)]
*  response to ordinary Israelis and Palestinians, people just trying to live [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1210.46s)]
*  their lives in peace. Absolutely. I recall very well being in Gaza when there [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1215.0s)]
*  was a five-day pause, two Novembers ago, and as the fighting started again, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1221.0s)]
*  during that pause, I would see children, just start to regain a little bit of [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1228.0s)]
*  confidence. The bomb started because, yes, leaders who had a voice, leaders who [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1233.0s)]
*  could have made these changes didn't. We said silence is complicity. This became [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1237.0s)]
*  a war on children. UNICEF did not say that for a headline. We said that because [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1241.0s)]
*  of the disproportionate, devastating effect of this on children in terms of [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1246.0s)]
*  numbers killed, numbers injured, and health systems and the education system. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1251.0s)]
*  Those leaders who from day one have shown a lack of compassion, a lack of [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1256.0s)]
*  empathy, unable to see the reality on the ground of their decisions or their lack [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1261.0s)]
*  of decisions. I never thought, Anna, I would meet a child who had lost their [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1266.0s)]
*  entire family. I mean grandparents, mum and dad, sisters, cousins, everyone. I've [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1270.0s)]
*  now met more than a dozen such children. So the reality is that the lack of [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1275.0s)]
*  empathy and compassion in these discussions from day one has been absolutely [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1280.0s)]
*  telling and it's been lethal. Now we sit on the cusp of hope, and that hope has to [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1284.0s)]
*  be full, full of sustained peace. This cannot be a temporary ceasefire. You [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1288.0s)]
*  cannot, with any good conscience, imagine returning to war, returning to what [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1293.0s)]
*  these families have endured. Because as your images have shown right now, that [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1298.0s)]
*  hope is boiling over in Gaza. People are imagining what it would be like, as a [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1302.0s)]
*  woman said to me, to tell my nine-year-old, tonight you go to sleep, and I promise [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1307.0s)]
*  you, you'll wake up tomorrow morning. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1311.0s)]
*  James Elder from UNICEF, thank you for joining us. Really appreciate it. It's [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1315.0s)]
*  eight minutes to nine here in the Middle East at the moment. We should be 22 [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1321.0s)]
*  minutes into a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, but as things stand, that has been [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1327.0s)]
*  delayed. We've heard from the IDF, the Israel Defence Forces, who say that [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1332.0s)]
*  they are ready to put that ceasefire into effect as soon as they receive that [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1336.0s)]
*  definitive list of hostages from Hamas. Hamas putting it down to technical [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1340.0s)]
*  difficulties, but as things stand, if you're just joining us, that breaking [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1344.0s)]
*  news, that that ceasefire, which should have begun by now, has been delayed. We [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1348.0s)]
*  know there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes to try and bring it [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1352.0s)]
*  back on track. I also want to speak to Dr Saladin Sawan, who's an NHS surgeon [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1356.0s)]
*  who's been volunteering in Gaza, just returned about three weeks ago. Doctor, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1360.0s)]
*  thank you for joining us this morning. Really appreciate your time. We've just [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1365.0s)]
*  been reflecting on civilians there in Gaza and how desperately they need right [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1369.0s)]
*  now an end to the fighting. Hi, good morning. Thank you for having me. I'm [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1374.0s)]
*  absolutely disappointed, utterly disappointed for the people of Gaza and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1381.0s)]
*  for people across both sides who were hoping for this ceasefire to be in place [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1385.0s)]
*  20 or so minutes ago. I agree with the speaker about the children there. I [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1392.0s)]
*  operated an hour when I was there. She actually lost her entire family, her [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1399.0s)]
*  mother, three sisters, and her dad was in nowhere to be seen. I looked after her [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1404.0s)]
*  after the operation where she had holes in the bowels. She was only 15, and I [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1410.0s)]
*  really did not know how to talk about her family. She was surrounded by her [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1415.0s)]
*  aunties, but not her immediate family where we killed civilians. Civilians got [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1420.0s)]
*  caught in the middle of it while actually, I mean, is it real, ceasefire to be [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1426.0s)]
*  delayed for the list of the names? I don't know. As an ordinary person, I feel [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1431.0s)]
*  that some people are indulgent in themselves in details, why they lost this [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1436.0s)]
*  sight, and to what happened to those families, to what happened in the ground. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1442.0s)]
*  They really, really need to see it a bit more to appreciate the suffering, the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1447.0s)]
*  atrocities taking place did not leave people alone. Doctor, I know, and as [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1452.0s)]
*  you're saying there, you know you're reflecting on people that you've helped, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1464.0s)]
*  people that you've worked with. One of the key parts of this deal is not just to [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1467.0s)]
*  stop the fighting, but to actually get much needed aid into Gaza, and from your [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1472.0s)]
*  point of view, particularly medical equipment as well, to rebuild those [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1476.0s)]
*  hospitals, many of which have been damaged and been put out of action. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1480.0s)]
*  Absolutely true. I mean, when I was operating in Nasser Hospital in Gaza, I [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1484.0s)]
*  had to read the fear of the blackout of the electricity, which happened often [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1491.0s)]
*  when I was there. There was, you know, you're in the middle of your operation, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1497.0s)]
*  and suddenly no electricity. Now I used my headlight, but the anesthetic device [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1502.0s)]
*  used electricity, and you would wait. Often the backup would kick in shortly, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1507.0s)]
*  but it took an occasion, few moments. So the hospital then need everything, fuel, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1512.0s)]
*  you need instruments, you need medicine, anesthetic, painkillers, you will need [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1519.0s)]
*  to get the doctors to get a nurse to help the system. There is no entire collapse [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1526.0s)]
*  there. I would point this as well. Actually we need journalists to get into Gaza [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1536.0s)]
*  to see for themselves what the utter devastation and destruction has taken place [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1542.0s)]
*  in Gaza and probably to build a world about how disappointed people there. I spoke [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1548.0s)]
*  to my colleagues who I got to know over the last few weeks, and when they're [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1555.0s)]
*  really full of hope, today, this morning, they will have some rest time, start to [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1560.0s)]
*  go and see their places and families. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1566.0s)]
*  Yeah, Doctor, it's an important point that you make that while Palestinian [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1570.0s)]
*  journalists have done an extraordinary job in covering this conflict, international [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1577.0s)]
*  journalists have been prevented from reporting inside Gaza. Doctor, thank you [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1582.0s)]
*  for joining us. In fact, I want to bring back in our chief international [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1586.0s)]
*  correspondent, Lisa Doucette. We should have been reporting the beginning of [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1591.0s)]
*  this ceasefire. We know that in just the last few moments there has been a [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1595.0s)]
*  visible explosion in Gaza, so things are not on track, things can hopefully be [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1599.0s)]
*  back on track, but I think just listening and watching over the last half hour or [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1603.0s)]
*  so, you really get a sense of the devastation that's been caused and how [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1606.0s)]
*  much this means to people on both sides. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1610.0s)]
*  And it's a measure of this moment that as we wait for what so many in Gaza, in [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1615.0s)]
*  Israel and around the world hope will be a ceasefire about to start, that we're [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1621.0s)]
*  discussing the suffering of children, the death of children, the maiming of [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1626.0s)]
*  children in what the United Nations has described as the 21st century atrocity, a [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1631.0s)]
*  war that has been unprecedented in every way. The fifth major war of recent time [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1637.0s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas, which has seen untold suffering. And as we've been [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1643.0s)]
*  reporting, every minute longer is a minute too long. Everyone is daring to hope that [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1650.0s)]
*  these are just technical difficulties and it does seem they are, Anna, but this [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1657.0s)]
*  war, this cautious hope that this war will end and not just end for a day or for [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1663.0s)]
*  weeks, will end altogether because as it ends, and even when it doesn't end, there [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1669.0s)]
*  are so many other wars. The battle for Palestinians to find enough to eat in [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1674.0s)]
*  Gaza, the battle to rebuild their homes, to rebuild their schools and hospitals, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1679.0s)]
*  and for Israelis who will welcome home their loved ones and those who won't, they [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1684.0s)]
*  too will have the battle about how to carry on. So much is invested in this [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1689.0s)]
*  moment. If it succeeds, it could put the region on the path to a future where the [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1694.0s)]
*  forever wars like this will come to an end, but if it doesn't, it could plunge it [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1701.0s)]
*  into even greater chaos. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1706.0s)]
*  Thank you, our chief international correspondent. As we see images coming in [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1708.0s)]
*  from the border, we see images coming in from Gaza, that breaking news this [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1714.0s)]
*  morning is that the ceasefire has not come into effect as it was supposed to, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1719.0s)]
*  but we will continue to keep you up to date through the day here on BBC News. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1723.0s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sY9bnKqi4c&t=1727.0s)]
