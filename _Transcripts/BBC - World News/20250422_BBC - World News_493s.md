Video Description: US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss and called him "a major loser".
 
In a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates "pre-emptively" to help boost the economy, and said Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments.
 
Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy came as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession.

# US stocks and dollar plunge as Donald Trump attacks Fed chair Jerome Powell | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y)
*  The market in the United States have taken another hit. Investors saw another steep slide [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=0.0s)]
*  on Wall Street. US stocks and the dollar plunged again on Monday as President Trump intensified [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=5.28s)]
*  his attacks on America's central bank boss, Jerome Powell. In a post on social media, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=10.76s)]
*  he called him, quote, a major loser for not lowering interest rates and called on Mr. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=16.46s)]
*  Powell to make preemptive cuts to help boost the economy. He said that the Fed had been [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. Well, the president's comments [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=26.52s)]
*  sent Wall Street sharply lower, with all three major indices down over 2%. Gold, which is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=31.88s)]
*  the traditional safe haven in the time of uncertainty, has hit another record high. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=37.8s)]
*  It's above $3,500. We're also seeing some movement on global currency markets too. The [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  British pound and the Japanese yen jumping to their highest level against the US dollar [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  since September last year. Well, let's make some sense of all this with Jeremy Stretch, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=53.6s)]
*  chief international strategist at CIBC Capital Markets. Jeremy, good to have you here and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=57.84s)]
*  do exactly that, if you will. What is going on here? Because, Mark, it's unsure of a direction [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=62.64s)]
*  over recent weeks. And then once again, further attacks on the head of America's independent [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=67.6s)]
*  central bank doesn't paint a picture of an economy that's pretty rosy right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=72.64s)]
*  Oh, no, that's right. And you hit the nail on the head there when you're talking about [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=78.32s)]
*  independence, because, of course, that's been one of the central benchmarks, which has really [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=81.76s)]
*  underlined why international investors over decades have invested very heavily in terms of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=85.84s)]
*  US assets, and particularly US treasuries, because of the independence of the central bank as the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=91.2s)]
*  baseline for monetary policy. And that issue or that bastion of independence is now being [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  threatened by Mr. Trump. And, of course, as you've mentioned, the IMF will be downgrading [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=102.56s)]
*  their global growth prospects this afternoon because of the influence on the impact of the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  tariff regime. So there is a real question mark regarding international investment flows going [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=111.36s)]
*  into the dollar. And in a sense, what we're seeing is international investors are deciding to keep [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=116.16s)]
*  more capital in terms of their own domestic markets. That includes the eurozone, it includes Japan, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=120.24s)]
*  and to an extent also includes the UK. So that is seeing investors moving away from the US dollar [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  and into alternative currencies, and then also seeing that sort of safe haven bid to add it to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=130.48s)]
*  the dollar as well. Yes. And as we said, the pound and the yen jumping to their highest level [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=135.52s)]
*  against the dollar since, I think, September. Is that about US dollar weakness or the strength [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=140.08s)]
*  of the pound and the yen? I think it's definitely a story of US dollar weakness. So we've seen [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=144.8s)]
*  international investors very much averse to holding dollars amidst this uncertainty, which [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  has really writ large, emanating from the US. I think in terms of Japan, it's very much the case [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  that Japanese investors are keeping more money onshore. So I think there is this sort of issue [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=160.56s)]
*  regarding concerns in terms of investing in US assets. I think in terms of the UK, I think it's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=166.0s)]
*  interesting that obviously we have seen a slight uptick in terms of some of the economic mood music [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=171.92s)]
*  over the course of the last few weeks, despite the broader uncertainties. Now, it may well be the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=176.8s)]
*  case that obviously the UK will see a downgrade to its growth prospects from the IMF later, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=181.52s)]
*  but on a relative basis, the UK is holding in on a broader basis compared to the US. And I think [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=185.84s)]
*  that is providing some scope for some resilience in terms of sterling and again, seeing less of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=191.92s)]
*  those outflows, which have really been influenced over the course of the last few years. Jeremy, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  always good to talk to you. Thanks for your insight on that. Jeremy Stretch, Chief International [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  Strategist at CIBC. Thank you. Well, that impact that tariffs is having on stock markets is raising [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=206.64s)]
*  fears of economic recession. And of course, that is top of the agenda at this year's World Bank and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=212.64s)]
*  International Monetary Fund spring meetings. They're both taking place in Washington, DC. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=217.92s)]
*  North America business correspondent is Michelle Fleury and she's there to talk us through what we [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  might expect. President Donald Trump, as is the norm, won't be attending the International [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, but his presence will loom large over the proceedings. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=233.6s)]
*  At the start of this year, the US economy, while it was looking pretty good, plenty of economists [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  were feeling upbeat. Many of them were forecasting growth of around two and a half percent, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=245.76s)]
*  but that optimism, it's starting to cool off. The International Monetary Fund is expected to dial [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=251.92s)]
*  down its global growth forecasts in large part because of Trump's trade war, which is being felt [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=257.76s)]
*  well beyond US borders. Inflation in the United States, which had been making progress, has started [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=262.96s)]
*  to stall out and those tariffs, well, they're not helping. The men and women who run the global [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=269.44s)]
*  economy and who are gathering this week for meetings in Washington are likely to try to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=275.44s)]
*  ramp up negotiations with the Trump administration in an attempt to try to evade duties. Adding to all [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=280.24s)]
*  of the drama, the United States is considering whether or not to withdraw from both institutions. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=287.12s)]
*  If that were to happen, it could shake things up in a big way. Michelle Fleury for us there in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=294.08s)]
*  Washington, DC. Michelle will have the very latest as those meetings get underway a little later. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  Let's talk though now to Ariane Curtis, who's Senior Global Economist at Capital Economics. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=305.2s)]
*  Ariane, good to have you here. Talk to me about what we might expect because all the mood music [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=309.84s)]
*  suggests they're going to downgrade growth, they're going to warn on the impacts of those tariffs, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  rising inflation. None of it looks good. Is there any area where there might be optimism? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=317.76s)]
*  Yeah. As you said, the main focus is really going to be on the impact of tariffs and really this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=322.88s)]
*  trade uncertainty, how that can weigh on the global outlook. It's the first set of IMF and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=329.12s)]
*  World Bank meetings since tariffs were started to be announced earlier this year. It's not really [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=335.44s)]
*  a secret that there are downgrades ahead. The IMF have already warned of these notable markdowns [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=341.44s)]
*  in GDP forecasts for many countries. It's likely that the 3.3% growth forecast they [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  put out in January for this year will be revised significantly. And they're probably, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=357.44s)]
*  while a global recession won't be their base case, they're likely to flag that there will be greater [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=364.48s)]
*  risk of this, especially if countries retaliate significantly to US tariffs. So we might see a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=370.88s)]
*  situation where they kind of present this as a worst case scenario. If there was an all out trade [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=377.68s)]
*  war, this would knock X% off global GDP. How much influence do these reports have and how [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=383.36s)]
*  much should we care about the view of something like the World Bank or the IMF? Because at best, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  these are educated guesses about what might happen. We just don't know yet what impact these [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=393.68s)]
*  tariffs will have, do we? Yes. It's actually something that's really difficult for all [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=398.56s)]
*  forecasters, economic forecasters at this point. Almost what is the point of having forecasts when [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=403.76s)]
*  there's so much uncertainty? So it's probably more likely that they'll talk a lot in terms of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=408.72s)]
*  scenarios and really kind of an impact of if tariffs were foreign to this way, X%, then this [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=415.44000000000005s)]
*  could be the impact on growth and inflation in these countries. But really, it's going to be [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=423.12s)]
*  providing a range of estimates based on what just could happen to trade policies. Yeah. And one of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=427.6s)]
*  the things that's hard to quantify as well is sort of the indirect consequences of this and whether [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=433.36s)]
*  some countries around the world will think, well, blow the tariffs, we'll just deal with [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=437.6s)]
*  different countries instead and sort of cut America out of the picture. And that's quite hard to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  quantify at this stage. Yes, exactly. Of course, there's direct impacts from higher tariffs, but [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=445.12s)]
*  really it's this kind of indirect impact through this higher uncertainty that's going to be a big [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=452.0s)]
*  factor. For example, we've already seen business surveys and consumer confidence surveys really [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=458.16s)]
*  deteriorate so far this year, especially in the US. We've seen financial market conditions tighten [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=466.08s)]
*  a lot. And there could be quite a big hit to business investment, for example, if firms decide [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  to put plans on hold until tariff policies become more clear, if they ever do become more clear. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=479.2s)]
*  So you could think especially in some countries like Canada and Mexico, which are very integrated [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=485.68s)]
*  with the US, that that would weigh there. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzyuCAnd86Y&t=490.48s)]
