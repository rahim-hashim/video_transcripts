# Dominican Republic ends search for survivors after nightclub roof collapse | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0)
*  Now rescue workers in the Dominican Republic have ended their search for survivors of a nightclub roof collapse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=0.0s)]
*  Officials say that 218 bodies have now been recovered from the Jet Set Club in Santo Domingo. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=6.8s)]
*  The roof came down in the early hours of Tuesday during a concert by a well-known merengue singer, Ruby Perez. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=13.0s)]
*  He was among those killed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=20.0s)]
*  It is the Caribbean country's worst disaster in decades. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=22.0s)]
*  We will now cross over to Will Grant, who is in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, in a really difficult day there, Will. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=27.5s)]
*  Yes, it really has been a difficult few days and now the authorities are essentially bowing to the inevitable with this situation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=37.5s)]
*  It has moved officially from a search and rescue operation seeking survivors to officially a recovery operation of the victims' bodies. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=46.5s)]
*  In that sense, that reflects the fact that 218 people are known to have died in the collapse of the nightclub behind me, the Jet Set nightclub. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=56.5s)]
*  It is hugely shocking, as you said in your introduction, the worst such accident in Dominican history. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=69.5s)]
*  The family members who are here waiting for that news, unfortunately, have now received that tragic news or indeed identified the bodies of their relatives in a sort of makeshift morgue that is just to one side of the building. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=76.5s)]
*  And when it comes to the venue itself, is there an understanding of how this happened? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=91.5s)]
*  Well, that is what the question will be now that this has moved into the recovery phase. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=100.5s)]
*  I think the questions are going to ramp up onto exactly why this took place, how it happened. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=106.5s)]
*  A lot of fingers of blame are being pointed at a fire that took place here in 2023. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=113.5s)]
*  The question being, of course, were the proper repairs carried out at the time? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=120.5s)]
*  Was too much weight placed onto a vulnerable roof? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=125.5s)]
*  Was the entire building structurally compromised and not made safe? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=129.5s)]
*  The owner of the nightclub has flown into the Dominican Republic from the United States, living to continue his business to comply with the authorities. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=134.5s)]
*  He says that he and his management team have been completely transparent with the investigations and intend to remain so. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=144.5s)]
*  But, of course, extremely tough questions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=153.5s)]
*  I spoke to the mayor of this municipality and she said the families themselves would keep the pressure on to find the answers to those questions. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=156.5s)]
*  We'll grant, as always, thank you very much. We'll grant there in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. Thank you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJsJ98bUvO0&t=165.5s)]
