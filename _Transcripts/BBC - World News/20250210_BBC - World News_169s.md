It says it's a response to Israel breaching the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which began last month.

# Hamas says it's suspending the release of Israeli hostages | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ)
*  The Reuters news agency and AFP reporting the same thing that Hamas's armed wing have said they will delay [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  hostage releases planned for next Saturday until further notice. So that one line coming in, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=6.4s)]
*  let's head to Jerusalem and our correspondent Weirah Davis. And Weirah, are you hearing any more? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=13.44s)]
*  A lot. We've had a statement from Hamas from a spokesman saying they're going to plan at the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  minute. Remember this is only Monday, but they plan to postpone the next phase of hostage releases [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=25.44s)]
*  which would have been due this Saturday. Now the first phase of the ceasefire agreement has brought [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=31.36s)]
*  very concrete dividends so far for both sides. 21 Israeli hostages have been released in exchange [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=38.72s)]
*  for more than 500 Palestinian prisoners. But in total during this first phase, 33 hostages were [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=44.32s)]
*  due to be released. Only 21 have been released so far, so we would have been due another three [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=51.44s)]
*  this coming Saturday. But according to the Hamas statement, it is the failure of the Israelis, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=57.36s)]
*  they call them the occupiers and the occupation, to abide by the terms of the ceasefire. And what [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=63.04s)]
*  they're referring to in their statement are a couple of incidents over recent days and weeks [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=68.32s)]
*  in Gaza where people have still been attacked and shot and killed in certain circumstances by Israeli [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=73.28s)]
*  troops. They're also alleging Hamas that not enough promised aid has made it through to Gaza, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=79.52s)]
*  although there has been a huge increase in the amount of aid getting through since the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=86.24s)]
*  ceasefire started. And Hamas also say there have been restrictions in the ability of people to go [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=90.16s)]
*  back to their home areas, although again that is something that's clearly improved as we were [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=95.52s)]
*  reporting over the weekend. I think what this goes to show is that both sides are starting to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  square up to each other now as we get to the end of the critical first phase of the ceasefire. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=106.08s)]
*  Of course, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister, has some very strong words [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=112.08s)]
*  for Hamas regarding the state of the three hostages who were released last weekend. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=118.16s)]
*  He was saying that was unacceptable, it could be allowed to happen again. So both sides have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=124.4s)]
*  got some pretty strong words to say about each other. Whether or not this threat to postpone [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=129.52s)]
*  the next phase of the hostage deal is actually carried through, we'll have to wait and see. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=134.8s)]
*  Remember, it is only Monday and this next release wouldn't be due till Saturday. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  Has there been any official Israeli reaction since that news emerged? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=144.96s)]
*  No, nothing yet, although Mr Netanyahu has been speaking in a Knesset today against some very [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  strong belligerent words. Maybe again this is Hamas's way of pushing back against some of what [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=155.28s)]
*  Mr Trump, Donald Trump, has had to say about his plans for the future of Gaza. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4huZRZwCzQ&t=161.04s)]
