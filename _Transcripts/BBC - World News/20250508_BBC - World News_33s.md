**BBC - World News:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA)
*  We're so excited. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're just about to cry. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=1.28s)]
*  This is the reaction in the square, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=3.56s)]
*  minutes after white smoke has come out of the chimney over the Sistine Chapel, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=5.92s)]
*  letting the world know that the Cardinals have chosen a new pope. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=9.72s)]
*  I'm feeling very honoured to be here in this moment, a lot of happiness. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=12.88s)]
*  The white smoke came at the end of the first four days of voting, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=15.92s)]
*  during which 133 Cardinals had been locked away in the Vatican right behind me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  We don't know who it is yet, but it's just so exciting to be here and so special. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=24.48s)]
*  All eyes will be on this balcony right behind me, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=28.08s)]
*  where the new pope will make his first appearance. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlQS7q4fuA&t=30.36s)]
