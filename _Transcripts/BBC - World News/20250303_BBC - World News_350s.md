Video Description: Mayors in Northern France have called on Keir Starmer to visit to better understand the impact of small boat crossings in the region.
 
In a message to the UK prime minister, the mayor of Ambleteuse, Stéphane Pinto, said co-operation between the two countries was "a must".
 
Home Office Minister Dame Angela Eagle said the UK government had "ramped up" its work with French authorities, revealing French police had stopped 28,000 small boat crossings last year.
 
Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was in Calais last week to meet politicians and officials, but Dame Angela declined to comment on whether the prime minister planned to accept the invitation.

# Mayors call for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to visit Calais migrant camps | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg)
*  Now, staying in Europe because mayors in the French region of Calais are calling on the UK Prime Minister to visit and see for himself what they call a humanitarian crisis, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=0.0s)]
*  with hundreds of migrants living in squalid conditions waiting to cross the channel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=10.64s)]
*  Around 2,000 people have made the crossing in small boats so far this year, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=15.44s)]
*  but as Simon Jones reports from France, multiple fatalities since have not stopped the desire of people reaching Britain. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=19.68s)]
*  Calais' newest tented city, where people wait before they attempt to cross the channel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=30.96s)]
*  Charities describe the conditions as inhumane. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=36.64s)]
*  The camp is squalid, there are no working toilets, no proper washing facilities. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  But the one thing people do have here is hope. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=43.92s)]
*  Hope of a new life. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Zinke showed us the tent in which he has spent the last two months. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=48.56s)]
*  He says he fled persecution in his home country and now dreams of England. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=51.84s)]
*  The Sudanese people, specifically, they prefer England to other countries. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=56.16s)]
*  I think because of the language maybe. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  And some people have relatives over there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=64.16s)]
*  So there is many reasons. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=70.16s)]
*  He's seen friends lose their lives getting from Sudan as far as here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=72.64s)]
*  You see your brother die in the sea and also you try to cross. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=77.12s)]
*  So everyone has their own destiny. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  This hangar is now home to hundreds of people, but it's impossible to say exactly how many [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=85.6s)]
*  because the population is constantly changing as some here manage to reach the UK. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  In neighbouring Dunkirk, the UK government's talk of smashing the gangs or previously stopping the boats [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  has not stopped the steady stream of people arriving, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=103.6s)]
*  wanting a swift departure across the channel and away from conditions like these. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  Akan from Iran told me he'd been on a dinghy that sank. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=111.36s)]
*  It's very, you know, dangerous. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=114.96s)]
*  We thought we would die. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  You thought you would die? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=119.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=120.16s)]
*  But after the French big boat came to help us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=120.88s)]
*  But you'll try again? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=124.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  I'm really scared. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=128.0s)]
*  What's good about the UK? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=129.28s)]
*  It's good about the UK. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=131.68s)]
*  I can get a new life, bro. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=132.8s)]
*  New life? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=134.72s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=135.68s)]
*  I can start a new life from there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=136.8s)]
*  I want to go there, to live there, to get a comfortable life there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=138.8s)]
*  Sudan is not good as well as you see from the news. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=142.32s)]
*  That is why I want to go to England, UK. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=145.52s)]
*  Why not stay in France? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=148.96s)]
*  To stay in France is very difficult for me because I speak English as you see from me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't speak French. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=155.92s)]
*  There was petrol in the boat. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=157.12s)]
*  This man said the boat he was helping to carry to the water caught fire. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=159.12s)]
*  These are persons that see the water. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=163.44s)]
*  There's our boat. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=170.0s)]
*  They burn the boat. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=170.64s)]
*  Go see. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=172.16s)]
*  The mood in the camp is volatile. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  As we were visiting, one man made it clear he wanted us to leave. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=175.44s)]
*  Go see. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=178.72s)]
*  From the air and from the land, the police bolstered by British cash [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=183.92s)]
*  are attempting to prevent the boats launching and stop deaths at sea. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=188.72s)]
*  Last year was the deadliest on record for channel crossings. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=192.88s)]
*  The beach littered with failed attempts. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=196.16s)]
*  This is where the cat and mouse game between the migrants and the police plays out in the sandy dunes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=198.64s)]
*  Here, migrants can wait for hours for the perfect weather conditions, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  bringing with them their own provisions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  More than 36,000 people crossed the channel in small boats last year. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=212.72s)]
*  The British government has recently toughened up rules, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=216.88s)]
*  making it almost impossible for someone who arrives in the UK that way to become a British citizen. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=219.76s)]
*  But the mayor of the seaside village of Omleteur, Stéphane Pinto, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=225.76s)]
*  has joined other officials in calling for the British Prime Minister to visit the Calais region [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=229.28s)]
*  to see first-hand the precious small boat crossings are putting on the community. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  I'd say to him, well, I'd show him our beach, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=245.04s)]
*  that once again we must make sure that cooperation between the English and French [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  is strengthened to control what's happening, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=254.56s)]
*  to put in place measures that mean we no longer find bodies on our beaches. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=257.12s)]
*  We can't have that anymore. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  Although the Home Secretary went to Calais last week, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=266.0s)]
*  the government has stopped short of committing to Sakhir Starmer doing the same. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=268.64s)]
*  The Prime Minister is absolutely determined to put a stop to the exploitation that's going on. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=272.8s)]
*  We are working very closely with our French counterparts [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=279.12s)]
*  because the key to dealing with a cross-border issue is to work [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=283.36s)]
*  with other jurisdictions both operationally and politically. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  As patrols continue night and day, Calais' MP from Marine Le Pen's National Rally Party [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=292.0s)]
*  welcomes cooperation but rules out the idea of British police on French beaches. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=297.6s)]
*  It wouldn't make us appear weak, which we are not. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=302.56s)]
*  It would be perceived very badly by the French population. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=306.32s)]
*  Charities, though, are calling for more safe and legal routes for people to claim asylum in the UK. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=310.56s)]
*  The increased spending, I guess, the militarisation of the beaches, of the air, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=315.52s)]
*  barbed wire fences, concrete blocks, police patrols, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=322.56s)]
*  and all of this money, to my mind, changes nothing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=325.76s)]
*  It makes people maybe more desperate, it maybe causes people to make bad judgement calls. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=329.36s)]
*  As people here plan their crossings, the British government says it's investing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=335.92s)]
*  in technology and capabilities to boost collaboration with European partners [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=339.92s)]
*  to break up the smuggling networks. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=344.56s)]
*  Simon Jones, BBC News, Calais. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_4NJtoFVg&t=346.88s)]
