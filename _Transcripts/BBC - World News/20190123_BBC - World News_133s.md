Video Description: At two years and eight months, they live in Cardiff, having moved with their father, Ibrahima Ndiaye, 50, from their birth place of Senegal.
It's been a journey of hardship, with the family swapping a prosperous existence for one of hostels and food banks.
The girls are now safe, but a shadow looms.
Marieme's heart is weak - so weak, she may die.
If this happens, her stronger sister Ndeye will die with her.

# What is the future for these conjoined twins? - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 23, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo)
*  It was very difficult for me and it was a great shock for me also when they were born [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=0.0s)]
*  because we didn't have any indication that they were twins, first and concurrent twins. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=18.04s)]
*  It's a very difficult situation with children suffering from severe disabilities in Senegal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=23.84s)]
*  So I didn't want to let them to be facing any risk for their survival. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=29.92s)]
*  What I decided at this point is not to focus on what will happen tomorrow. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=49.24s)]
*  I'm just trying to look after them and to make them happy as possible. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=54.4s)]
*  Like any other siblings, it can go from chatting, laughing together, clapping, playing together, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=65.16s)]
*  and sometimes arguing and sometimes disputing toys. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=73.6s)]
*  They're here. They're warriors. What I can do is just be beside them, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=84.36s)]
*  killing one of my child for another. It's as easy as that. This is something I can't do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=107.55999999999999s)]
*  I can't allow myself to choose who will live, who will die now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7i_sCQMfvo&t=117.0s)]
