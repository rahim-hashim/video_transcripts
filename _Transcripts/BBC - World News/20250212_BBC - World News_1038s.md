Video Description: US defence secretary Pete Hesgeth says it is "unrealistic" to expect Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders when Russia first took control of Crimea.
 
He also downplayed suggestions of Ukraine joining Nato and ruled out deploying US troops to Ukraine under any future security arrangements.
 
Ukraine has repeatedly called for Nato membership and has rejected ceding territory as part of any peace deal.
 
Russia currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the east and south.

# Return to Ukraine's 2014 borders 'unrealisticâ€™, says US defence secretary | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw)
*  Hello, in the last few minutes the new US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=0.0s)]
*  setting out his country's position on the future of Ukraine and on potential [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=6.04s)]
*  future negotiations to end Russia's war there. Speaking alongside international [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=10.84s)]
*  counterparts including the British Defense Secretary at a meeting in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=16.68s)]
*  Brussels, he said that a critical moment had been reached where stopping the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=20.18s)]
*  bloodshed in Ukraine is a top priority. But he told allies that any future [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=24.84s)]
*  settlement backed by international forces between Ukraine and Russia could [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=30.04s)]
*  not be led by NATO and he added that no US troops would be deployed to any [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=35.0s)]
*  future peacekeeping force. He also insisted that Ukrainian membership of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=40.72s)]
*  NATO was not a realistic outcome of any settlement between Kiev and Moscow. Let's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  have a listen to what Pete Hegseth, the new US Defense Secretary, had to say in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=52.2s)]
*  Brussels. We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  war and cause more suffering. A durable peace for Ukraine must include robust [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=77.4s)]
*  security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again. This must not [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=83.12s)]
*  be Minsk 3.0. That said, the United States does not believe that NATO [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=89.4s)]
*  membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=99.64000000000001s)]
*  Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non- [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  European troops. If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=111.64s)]
*  any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and they [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=117.12s)]
*  should not be covered under Article 5. There also must be robust international [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  oversight of the line of contact. To be clear, as part of any security guarantee [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine. To further enable effective [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=134.8s)]
*  diplomacy and drive down energy prices that fund the Russian war machine, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  President Trump is unleashing American energy production and encouraging other [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=147.72s)]
*  nations to do the same. Lower energy prices coupled with more effective [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=152.44s)]
*  enforcement of energy sanctions will help bring Russia to the table. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=163.56s)]
*  NATO. As part of this, Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=167.92s)]
*  lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine. Members of this contact group must meet [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  the moment. That's Pete Hegseth, the new US defence secretary. He was also [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  saying, by the way, that he thinks that 5% should be the minimum for military [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=187.2s)]
*  spending by NATO countries, substantially more than they are paying at the moment. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=192.32s)]
*  Well, let's talk now and get some reaction from Ukraine to what he was [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  saying about any possible future peace settlement in Ukraine. We can talk to the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=201.56s)]
*  Ukrainian politician and former Minister for Infrastructure, Volodymyr Omelian, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=206.48s)]
*  who joins us now. Thank you so much for being with us. I don't know if you heard [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=212.0s)]
*  what Pete Hegseth was saying there in Brussels, but essentially he was saying, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=215.16s)]
*  returning Ukraine to its borders before 2014 is unrealistic and also that any [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=219.2s)]
*  future settlement could not have Ukraine as a member of NATO. Ukrainian membership [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=227.72s)]
*  of NATO would not be part of a peace plan. What's your reaction to all of that? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. It's a great honour to be with you today. Yes, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=239.28s)]
*  I listened carefully to what was said by the United States. I wouldn't say that it's a real [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  pleasure news for us because we do believe that the approach to please the beast, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=250.64s)]
*  it's an approach of mistake. We already tried it once in Munich in 1938, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=258.12s)]
*  and I don't want to repeat the same approach on the eve of Munich conference. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=265.24s)]
*  With Russia, we can talk only with strength because Russia, together with China, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=271.68s)]
*  is a challenging West right now. I hope not to concur with Europe, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=277.24s)]
*  but definitely challenging West by different means. And I would simply remind you that by 2014, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=281.32s)]
*  before Russian invasion, we were a neutral country. We are not applying for NATO membership. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  And this happened, the invasion itself and bloody war, which was increased in 2022. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=296.4s)]
*  So I don't believe that any kind of neutrality or any kind of just stopping war for peace will [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=303.2s)]
*  change the situation, unfortunately. But what would be the elements of a future peace deal? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=312.2s)]
*  There has to be a peace deal one day, whenever it is, and surely that has to involve the exchange [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=319.24s)]
*  of territory. I mean, would Ukraine, could Ukraine accept that Russia will hold on to some of the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=325.72s)]
*  territory in Ukraine that it has seized? I don't believe that Russia, which is backed [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  right now by China, and we should all remember the recent words of Mr. Xi that he is coming to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=340.36s)]
*  Moscow on the 9th of May this year to celebrate victory over Nazism, that Russia is ready for [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=346.48s)]
*  peace. They will try to blackmail, they will try to trade and to do everything possible to capture [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=354.84s)]
*  more Ukrainian territory in order to actually approach NATO borders. Moscow was always talking [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=364.0s)]
*  about NATO approaching Russia, but in fact, Russia is approaching NATO borders nowadays. And I believe [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=371.64s)]
*  this is the biggest threat we face right now, because we do not know where they are going to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=379.2s)]
*  stop. And we can only guess they are going to go further to the extent possible. Promising signs [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=384.59999999999997s)]
*  from Washington that they would like to decrease prices for oil, and this is the main financial [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  instrument for Russians to keep Red Army alive. Without money, they will lose. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=399.96s)]
*  Listening to Pete Hegseth there, the new US defence secretary, did it make you think, did it confirm [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=405.04s)]
*  in your mind really what you had feared, that the new Trump administration in Washington is going to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=415.32s)]
*  be less sympathetic to Ukraine than the Joe Biden administration was? In other words, that you're [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  going to have a tougher time now with Trump in the White House than you would have done if it had been [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  the Democrats still in the White House? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump criticised Biden badly for operation in Afghanistan, and I don't believe that Trump would like to repeat [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=434.23999999999995s)]
*  the same mistake with Ukraine. So I don't think that the United States will leave Europe forever. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=444.12s)]
*  But definitely what was voiced today, it's a clear sign to all European nations that handle your [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=452.12s)]
*  home issues with your own capacities. And I hope that we will have the United Kingdom as a leading [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=459.08s)]
*  power in Europe to be with Ukraine in this situation. I hope that Germany after elections [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=468.12s)]
*  and France will join us in this big war just to stop it. Because definitely if Ukraine is left [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=477.0s)]
*  alone, it will be a huge problem for us. We will not surrender, we will keep on fighting because it's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=488.04s)]
*  our land, it's our independence and it's our nation. But I would say the results of this fight will be [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=493.72s)]
*  definitely very exhausting for Ukraine. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=505.64000000000004s)]
*  Vladimir Omelian, thank you so much for being with us with that instant reaction to what we were just [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=508.04s)]
*  hearing from the new US defence secretary. Mr Omelian there, a former, is a Ukrainian politician [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=512.52s)]
*  and also former Minister for Infrastructure. Thank you very much indeed. And we can also talk to our [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  security correspondent Frank Gardner, who's joining me in the studio. Well, as we were just discussing [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=525.56s)]
*  there, what we heard from the new US defence secretary in Brussels is pretty alarming, isn't it, for the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=530.52s)]
*  Ukrainian side? I think it's a real cold shower for the Ukrainians and to some extent for NATO as [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=537.88s)]
*  well and for Europe. Everyone, including Ukraine, was braced for what the US policy is going to be, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=543.24s)]
*  what this great big peace plan that is going to be worked out, that has been drawn up by Keith [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=549.56s)]
*  Kellogg. But this today, in the last few minutes, is the clearest indication yet of where the United [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=554.04s)]
*  States stands. And it's pretty much bad news on all fronts for Ukraine. Ruling out any chance of NATO [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=559.8s)]
*  membership, that'll please President Putin because that was one of the things he was, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=567.08s)]
*  that was an absolute red line for him. Ruling out a return to the 2014 borders, so that was the year [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=571.0s)]
*  in which Russia invaded, occupied and annexed Crimea, saying that we're simply taking it back [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  because Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union in 1954. Russia, we're [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=583.88s)]
*  simply taking it back. And I have to say that even Russians who don't like President Putin [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=590.12s)]
*  supported that. Navalny, for example, the dissident. No US troops are going to go in [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=594.84s)]
*  peacekeep in Ukraine. And finally, Europe has got to spend a great deal more on defence, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=602.0400000000001s)]
*  money which it doesn't feel that it has. So this is a real wake up call and this will be [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=608.2800000000001s)]
*  received very badly in Kiev, very well in Moscow and with a lot of nervousness in Brussels at NATO [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=615.0s)]
*  headquarters. Where does this leave the prospects of a peace agreement one day? Because of course, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=621.72s)]
*  Donald Trump had famously said he could end the war in a day. I mean, he hasn't quite managed that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=627.72s)]
*  But I mean, does this make peace talks any more likely or less likely, do you think? I mean, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=633.08s)]
*  we're just hearing from that Ukrainian politician saying, you know, they don't want to hear this, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=638.12s)]
*  they're going to fight on. Yeah, it's going to be very difficult for Ukraine to hold back [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=641.5600000000001s)]
*  the Russian advance without US military support. So if Washington pulls that rug completely and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=648.76s)]
*  says, look, if you want to keep thinking that you're going to get Crimea back and all of those [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=655.08s)]
*  oblasts, most of which have been taken by the Russians, the four provinces, so Kherson, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=660.6s)]
*  Zaporizhzhya, Donetsk and Ransk, you know, then I think it's very unlikely we're going to see [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=667.0s)]
*  sustained US support. Europe will continue, but it's a fraction or it's a lot less than what [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=673.08s)]
*  Ukraine needs. Ukraine is losing. I went to a very interesting briefing in the last 24 hours [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=678.84s)]
*  where it's pretty pessimistic. I mean, Russia is also losing a vast amount of troops, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=685.32s)]
*  about a thousand casualties, that's killed, captured, wounded and missing every single day. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=692.2800000000001s)]
*  But they've got the mass to be able to sustain this. And Russian commanders have always had [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=697.48s)]
*  a very, frankly, comparatively uncaring attitude towards the lives and welfare of their troops [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=703.0s)]
*  compared to Western commanders and Ukrainians for that matter. So they're prepared to throw [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=709.24s)]
*  large numbers of troops, including North Koreans, at the Ukrainian lines, knowing that by doing this [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=714.92s)]
*  over and over again, they can push the Ukrainians back. So is there going to be a peace deal? Well, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=721.32s)]
*  there has to be eventually because you can't change geography. Russia and Ukraine are always [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=725.56s)]
*  going to be neighbours. President Putin has made it very clear he's not going to settle for anything [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=730.28s)]
*  less than bringing Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. People like President Macron have said, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=734.76s)]
*  if we let the Russians win in Ukraine, that'll be a disaster for Europe. We've got to stop this. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=740.76s)]
*  The question is, Europe doesn't... I mean, there's research that came out yesterday that Russia is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=745.24s)]
*  spending more on defence than the whole of Europe combined. Europe doesn't have the muscle in terms [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=750.04s)]
*  of its military industrial capability to sustain this fight in the way that Russia does. And [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=756.92s)]
*  speaking of spending on military, there was a bucket of cold water for Ukraine from what Pete [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=763.3199999999999s)]
*  Hegseth, the US defence secretary, was saying. But there's also a bucket of cold water for NATO, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=768.4399999999999s)]
*  wasn't there? Because he was saying, you guys need to be spending 5% of your budgets, of your GDP, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=772.52s)]
*  on defence. Now, this is way, way, way more than they're currently spending, isn't it? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=779.3199999999999s)]
*  It's unaffordable. But also the US isn't spending 5%. US is spending roughly 3.4% [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=784.36s)]
*  of its national wealth, of its GDP, on defence. Britain is agonising over whether or not to go [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=790.6s)]
*  from... to inch up, as somebody put it, from 2.3% to 2.5%. Plenty of countries that are closer to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=796.44s)]
*  Russia, like Poland and the Baltic states, are spending over 3%, more like 4%. Poland has [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=804.28s)]
*  massively built up their armed forces, while we have massively run ours down. There is currently, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=811.16s)]
*  just to remind ourselves, a big strategic defence review going on in the UK, chaired by Lord [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=817.24s)]
*  Robertson, a highly respected former Labour defence secretary and NATO secretary general, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  aided and abetted by Fiona Hill and General Richard Barron. They are looking not at so much [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=828.36s)]
*  how much money to spend, what percentage, but where the money is best spent. And part of the [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=834.28s)]
*  problem is that certainly in the UK, there's been massive wastage. They've squandered so much money [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=840.04s)]
*  on things that are not particularly useful, effective or relevant to the modern battlefield. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=846.36s)]
*  Frank, as ever, thank you very much indeed. Frank Gardner, our security correspondent. Let's get [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=852.12s)]
*  some reaction from Ukraine and speak to our Kiev correspondent, James Waterhouse, who's there for [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=856.12s)]
*  us now. James, well, it was quite an extraordinary session with the new US defence secretary, Pete [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=861.64s)]
*  Hegseth. Quite a lot to unpack there, but as we were discussing with Frank, he basically said [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=867.24s)]
*  it's unrealistic for Ukraine to expect to go back to its pre-2014 borders. It can't be a member of [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=872.52s)]
*  NATO. There won't be US troops on the ground to protect any future ceasefire agreement. What do [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=879.8s)]
*  you think the reaction in Ukraine is going to be to all of that? Well, but I think all of the things [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=885.8s)]
*  you've just listed will be a devastating blow to Ukraine. I think Kiev knew that it was engaging [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=892.28s)]
*  with the White House. That was less sympathetic than the Biden administration. It was hoped that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=899.56s)]
*  maybe it would take a different approach. It might even shock the course of the war into [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=905.48s)]
*  a different direction through possibly heightened support to bring the war to a quicker end. But [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=912.6s)]
*  just listening to Pete Hegseth there, from here it didn't sound like Ukraine's biggest ally was [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=917.96s)]
*  talking. It sounded like something you'd hear closer to Moscow. I mean, what I mean by that is [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=923.72s)]
*  that Moscow is clearly going to be happy with what was being said there. When he talks about [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=930.6800000000001s)]
*  the 1991 borders of Ukraine, which includes Crimea, which includes those eastern territories which [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=935.48s)]
*  have been battered by war for the best part of 12 years, when he talks about those being restored [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=941.96s)]
*  as an illusionary goal, what that translates to is a reward for Russia for the 12 years of aggression [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=947.8s)]
*  it has imposed on Ukraine. When you talk about NATO membership, one of the things [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=956.3599999999999s)]
*  that Ukraine had been angling for, had been leaning towards, being pulled towards, certainly around [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=965.64s)]
*  2014 to Russia's annoyance, was NATO and EU membership, something the country at the time, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=972.36s)]
*  you know, and still does diplomatically and politically want. And Russia, through [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=980.52s)]
*  force, has, according to what Pete Hegseth has said, successfully pulled Ukraine the other way [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=987.88s)]
*  politically. This is what this potentially amounts to. And I think if you look at what he is saying [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=995.72s)]
*  here, if you see the language being used between Washington and Moscow, where Donald Trump was [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=1001.0s)]
*  complimentary towards Vladimir Putin with the recent American prisoner release, you know, Ukraine [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=1007.0s)]
*  will be thinking, hearing those words, well, where do we go from here? I think it is in a far [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=1012.36s)]
*  lonelier place as it continues to fight this war, and not least when you have President [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=1017.4s)]
*  Zdenensky saying any future security guarantees for Ukraine require the US. You also have Europe's [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=1022.12s)]
*  own admission that it can't plug the gap left, although it will seemingly try. So this is a stark [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=1029.56s)]
*  moment, I think, politically for Ukraine. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7XRdLPI4dw&t=1036.12s)]
