Video Description: Argentine President Javier Milei has denied promoting a newly launched cryptocurrency which collapsed shortly after he mentioned it in a social media post on Friday.

The cryptocoin $Libra quickly rose in value before nosediving, causing severe losses for the majority of people who had invested in it.

A judge will now determine if the president should face fraud charges over the incident.

# Argentina's President Javier Milei denies crypto fraud allegations | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8)
*  Can we talk also about the Argentinian president Javier Mele? He's now facing calls for impeachment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=0.0s)]
*  He promoted this little-known cryptocurrency on X. The price soared and then it collapsed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=8.52s)]
*  after his endorsement costing investors billions of dollars. How serious is this, the calls [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  for his impeachment and what is he saying about it? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=24.42s)]
*  Well, it's not that unusual in Argentina for opposition to sort of call for impeachment [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  of a president that they don't agree with. So on that side of things, not necessarily [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=33.64s)]
*  the case that that means he's certainly facing imminent impeachment or anything like that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=38.68s)]
*  What is potentially more problematic for him is that the government has said it will investigate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=43.0s)]
*  what happened, including investigating the president himself about whether there are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=48.28s)]
*  fraud involved in this specific case. He essentially posted about this cryptocurrency, this dollar [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=54.68s)]
*  libra currency on social media before deleting the post. And as you say, that meant that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=61.44s)]
*  the price sort of soared and then it immediately crashed, causing some investors to... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=66.56s)]
*  I'm really hearing. He said this private project will be dedicated to encouraging the growth [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=71.2s)]
*  of the Argentine economy. And then he posted shortly after, I was not aware of the details [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=75.44s)]
*  of the project and having become aware of it, I decided not to continue spreading it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  So he deleted it. But everybody's money was in by that point. So it was too late. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=84.16s)]
*  That's right. As I was just saying, he did post it and then delete it. And he is now [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  being investigated by a court, but also internally within government to see if he will face any [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=95.88s)]
*  repercussions for this. He's responded, though, essentially saying that if people invested, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=100.72s)]
*  then that is their fault. It's a bit like if you go to a casino and gamble money, he argues, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=105.88s)]
*  it is people putting their money at risk. So he's denying that he was promoting it. He claims that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=110.92s)]
*  he was simply sharing it and that it was people's choice to then go and invest in it. But certainly, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=116.12s)]
*  I think that is something which will be investigated. If it if certainly a court sort of does bring [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=121.64s)]
*  fraud accusations against him more formally, then that could prove more problematic for the president. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=127.08s)]
*  One to follow. Really good to talk to you. Thanks, Haynie. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQ0EBibJN8&t=133.0s)]
