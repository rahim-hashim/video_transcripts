# What is no-deal Brexit? - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 26, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ)
*  No deal, a deal or no Brexit? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=0.0s)]
*  No, in the referendum we voted to leave and Parliament said it would honour that decision [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=7.24s)]
*  so it's made a law which means we leave. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=11.96s)]
*  We can't just say we fancy staying now, it's not that simple. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=14.36s)]
*  Well in March 2017 Theresa May activated something called Article 50. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=20.12s)]
*  Now that started a two year time frame in which we had to source out the terms of our [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=24.88s)]
*  departure from the EU, so organise things like what would happen to EU citizens living [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=29.12s)]
*  in the UK and British citizens living abroad, how much money if any we should pay the EU. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=33.78s)]
*  Now that time frame runs out soon on March 29th and as things stand we leave then whether [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=39.4s)]
*  we've sorted those things out or not. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=46.2s)]
*  Some people do want to press pause on the process but others think that would be a terrible [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=51.84s)]
*  idea and we should just get on with it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  If the UK did want to extend that Article 50 phase it would have to ask the EU and all [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=58.72s)]
*  of the EU's other 27 countries would have to agree to in effect delay Brexit. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=64.6s)]
*  We might have heard of something called a transition period. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=73.76s)]
*  Now that would mean that once we officially leave at the end of March there's a period [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=76.56s)]
*  after where not much changes so there's time to put things in place like new trade or immigration [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=80.48s)]
*  but that transition period is part of a deal so if there is no deal there is no transition, we just leave. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Well back in November the EU and the UK government did agree a deal called a withdrawal agreement [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  and it sorted out things like citizens rights, how much money we'd pay the EU and what would [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=104.32s)]
*  happen at the border between Ireland which would be in the EU and Northern Ireland which [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  would be part of the UK. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=113.8s)]
*  The trouble is lots of MPs don't like it and MPs have to sign it off. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=115.64s)]
*  All the time they don't well it makes it more likely that we will leave without a deal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=121.0s)]
*  Oh and so far the EU says that deal is the only deal, they're not going to renegotiate it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=125.88s)]
*  Well no one really knows but when it comes to trade it means the UK would trade with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=136.76s)]
*  the EU as a third country because we'd no longer be a member so we'd use rules already [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=140.28s)]
*  drawn up by the World Trade Organisation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=145.52s)]
*  That's a global body which governs international trade so UK exports would be put under the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=148.44s)]
*  same checks and tariffs that the EU puts on other countries which aren't members and the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=153.84s)]
*  EU has said that would mean there would be a hard border so checks on goods going between [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=158.72s)]
*  Northern Ireland and Ireland. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=163.52s)]
*  The Prime Minister has often said that and there are people, particularly Brexiteers, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=169.84s)]
*  who agree with her. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  They say it would mean the UK could be fully independent, do trade deals around the world [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  and we shouldn't make compromises that would stop us getting a clean break from the EU. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=179.4s)]
*  But those who are against no deal say if that were to happen it could cause chaos at the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  borders, push up food prices and could damage businesses and the economy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=189.08s)]
*  There are some in Parliament who are trying to stop no deal, others want the Prime Minister [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  to rule it out. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  Theresa May says the best way to avoid no deal is to back her deal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wklqnTQpEkQ&t=200.0s)]
