# What's going on with China's economy? - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 28, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA)
*  China reports its slowest growth rate for nearly three decades. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=0.0s)]
*  And holds a trade war with America. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=4.0s)]
*  What does it mean for the rest of the world? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=6.0s)]
*  China has been the economic miracle of recent decades. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=8.0s)]
*  But is it running out of steam? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=11.0s)]
*  And why does this matter for the rest of us? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=13.0s)]
*  Let's just rewind. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=15.0s)]
*  China's economy is 42 times larger than it was in 1980. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=19.0s)]
*  The country relied on cheap, plentiful labour [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=24.0s)]
*  and has become the largest manufacturer and exporter of goods on the planet [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=27.0s)]
*  accounting for a fifth of global trade. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=31.0s)]
*  But growth has shifted down a gear. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=34.0s)]
*  The officials' figures say the economy is growing by about 6.6 percent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=36.0s)]
*  But independent economists think it may be closer to 5 percent or even lower. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=41.0s)]
*  Whatever the true figure, 2018 was China's weakest year since 1990. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=46.0s)]
*  But why? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=52.0s)]
*  Well, as the country flourished, so too did the wages of its workers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=54.0s)]
*  So it lost its competitive edge to the likes of Vietnam, the Philippines and Bangladesh. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=59.0s)]
*  To counter its reliance on exports, China is now focusing on its home market [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=65.0s)]
*  which means part of the slowdown is intentional. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=70.0s)]
*  Another reason is the size of China's debt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=73.0s)]
*  Borrowing by the government, companies and consumers now totals almost three times [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=76.0s)]
*  the size of the country's annual income. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=82.0s)]
*  The measures imposed by the government to curb lending have hit spending and investment [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=85.0s)]
*  feeding into the slowdown. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=90.0s)]
*  All of this has led to plenty of red lights flashing when it comes to the country's economic health. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=92.0s)]
*  So what does the slowdown look like inside China? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=98.0s)]
*  Let's start with manufacturing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=102.0s)]
*  Activity in that crucial sector which makes up two-fifths of the economy [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=103.0s)]
*  contracted for the first time in two years in December. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=107.0s)]
*  Then there's raw material prices. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=112.0s)]
*  As the world's factory, China dictates the price of many industrial metals and other commodities. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=114.0s)]
*  Some of those prices are falling as demand wanes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=120.0s)]
*  Households are feeling the squeeze. Their spending is going up by less. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=124.0s)]
*  Retail sales are expanding at their slowest rate in 15 years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=128.0s)]
*  Even car sales are falling for the first time in two decades. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=132.0s)]
*  And although such numbers should always be treated with caution, investors are worried. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=137.0s)]
*  Shanghai's stock market lost a quarter of its value in 2018. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=142.0s)]
*  And let's not forget the trade war with the US, which triggered tariffs on both sides. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=147.0s)]
*  While its impact so far has been limited, the threat of escalation remains a serious risk, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=152.0s)]
*  not just to Chinese but world trade growth. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=158.0s)]
*  And this is the crucial point. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=161.0s)]
*  Any slowdown in China's economy will have repercussions for countries across the world [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=163.0s)]
*  if Chinese consumers and companies are not buying as much as previously hoped. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=169.0s)]
*  So all doom and gloom while China's time in the sun, its superhuman growth spurt may be over. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=174.0s)]
*  By 2030, economists say growth will have settled down to about a third of its current value. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=181.0s)]
*  But even that would be enough to ensure it overtakes the US to take pole position as the world's largest economy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSfTKWscwdA&t=187.0s)]
