Video Description: Eyewitnesses and hospital sources have told the BBC that at least a dozen worshippers have been killed in a crowd crush at the Kumbh Mela festival in Prayagraj, India. 
 
The incident took place between 1am and 2am local time (19:30 and 20:30GMT) when it is believed some pilgrims tried to jump over police barricades to reach Sangam Nose, the point where India's most sacred river Ganges meets Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. 
 
Devotees believe that bathing in the river will cleanse their sins and help attain salvation.
 
Wednesday was billed as the most important day for bathing during the festival, and officials expected up to 100 million people would attend. 
 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in a post on X (formerly Twitter) offered his condolences to devotees who have lost family members.

**BBC - World News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w)
*  Hello there and welcome to BBC News with me, La Questa Burac. We begin the programme with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=0.0s)]
*  the breaking news this hour and the crush that has taken place at a huge Hindu religious [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=6.24s)]
*  festival. At least a dozen people have reportedly been killed. The accident happened when pilgrims [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=13.24s)]
*  who were sleeping by the river banks of the Prayagraj were trampled by others who had [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=20.16s)]
*  taken a dip in the waters. Organisers say that tens of millions of people are expected [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=26.0s)]
*  to attend Wednesday's bathing day at the Maha Kumbh Mela, one of the world's biggest religious [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=31.52s)]
*  festivals. So let's show you the live pictures, the latest live pictures from the scene. This [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=37.28s)]
*  is it and you can see just a glimpse of the numbers, the sheer number of people. This [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  is just one site, this is an area that spans some 40 square kilometres but as we heard [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=50.4s)]
*  there plays host to tens of millions of people. Now just to give you some quick background, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=57.08s)]
*  the incident actually took place between 1am and 2am local time. So that means it would [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=65.28s)]
*  have taken place in the dark as pilgrims were trying to jump over police barricades to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=73.8s)]
*  reach the point where India's most sacred river, the Ganges, meets the Yamuna and what [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=81.6s)]
*  is known as the mythical Sarawaswati rivers. We're also getting reports locally from a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=89.56s)]
*  number of our correspondents including Samira Hussain who is at the site that media are [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=97.44s)]
*  not being allowed inside one of the hospitals which is reportedly treating some of those [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  that are injured. So Vikas Pandey is reporting from the area and says that the main hospital [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=113.08s)]
*  at the Kumbh Mela has been turned into what he describes as a fortress and you can see [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=121.52s)]
*  pictures of some of those ambulances outside the hospital. They've been entering but also [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=128.64s)]
*  exiting the premises the entire morning reports that Vikas but no one including the media [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=135.82s)]
*  is being allowed to enter the hospital. We're also getting reports from the AFP news agency [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=143.82s)]
*  of allegations of mismanagement at the festival itself. Of course we're going to get a lot [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  more of this discussion in terms of blame and the cause of the crush over the coming [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=159.18s)]
*  hours and I'm sure days. Well our correspondent Samira Hussain who I said is at the scene [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  has been able to send us this update. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=170.16s)]
*  Just over this way is the main bathing area where everyone wants to take a dip in the holy waters [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=200.16s)]
*  and there was such a crush of people that they came over this way and as ever in this kind of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=206.94s)]
*  a crowd one person gets pushed and it ended up that people got trapped. We saw bodies being taken [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=214.44s)]
*  away from here on stretchers. There's no official word on the number of people that are feared dead [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=222.74s)]
*  or the number of people that are injured and what's also remarkable here is that just as quickly [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=228.8s)]
*  as that entire situation was cleared away you now see that there are so many thousands of people [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=234.56s)]
*  that have now come through here again because ultimately this was about faith for so many [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  people not as what has brought them here and so they are still determined to go and take a dip [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  in those holy waters. So Samira Hussain is at the scene and she joins us live now. So Samira [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=253.12s)]
*  thank you for joining us I can imagine just how frantic things are locally but I'm just looking [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=261.8s)]
*  at the scene behind you and we just heard you there describe that people are continuing to come [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=267.04s)]
*  to the scene. Absolutely because you know if you think about it this is a festival that happens [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=272.0s)]
*  once every 12 years and so millions of devotees have come from all across the country so you know [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=280.6s)]
*  and in terms of disseminating information sometimes it's actually really hard for people to know what's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=289.0s)]
*  happening you know on one part of the Malak grounds to another so to give you a little bit of geography [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=294.76000000000005s)]
*  you know just down this way is where you know that crush of people happened but this entire area is [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  about 40 square kilometers large and so it's really hard to control these kinds of numbers and so you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=308.68s)]
*  know people still want to come because remember this is a religious festival and after all it is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=316.56s)]
*  faith that has been driving these millions of people to come here and to take a dip. Okay so [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=321.56s)]
*  talking about getting information and disseminating information is that being received from both local [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  and national officials? There is certainly a lot of pressure being put on officials everyone is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  asking the question when it comes to what exactly are the numbers of those that are dead and what [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=345.24s)]
*  are injured and if you look at Indian media and if you look at you know it just runs the gamut [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=351.36s)]
*  you know we can report that we've seen a dozen bodies being taken out of that particular area [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=357.44s)]
*  I mean you know on my own count in fact we saw people coming out on stretchers and we saw people [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=365.92s)]
*  on the ground you know so there's of course one part of that is trying to get accurate numbers [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=371.16s)]
*  but then of course there's going to be the accountability. Look organizers have been planning [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=377.84s)]
*  for this event for several months we even spent time in the control room area where they're [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=382.68s)]
*  monitoring some 2,700 feeds but how is it with all of those capabilities that something like this [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=388.8s)]
*  still happened? Okay on that point Sameera I was going to say so you've described there how there [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  was an immense amount of planning and certainly officials had the time to put that planning in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=402.12s)]
*  action I wonder if we could just show the scene of the people moving this is the live shot hopefully [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=407.24s)]
*  we can bring that up for you Sameera what measures are in place on the ground in terms of barriers [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=414.52s)]
*  in terms of people on the ground guiding people because to be honest with you it just looks like [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=422.0s)]
*  a free-for-all. Right and so you know the way it was organized as I said explained it to me was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  that they because they have so many of these cameras put up absolutely everywhere around the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=436.8s)]
*  city what they wanted to do was to be able to prevent any kind of blockades before they happen [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=442.32s)]
*  and so for example they would have cameras set up at the train station and if there was a large [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=449.64s)]
*  crowd at the train station well then they would set up barriers to try and disperse the crowds [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=454.12s)]
*  they would get people get police officers to help and disperse the crowds so that was part of the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=459.12s)]
*  crowd management and you know what the the police the head of the police that was in charge of this [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=464.8s)]
*  well what he said to me is that you know crowd management actually happens far before any incident [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=471.12s)]
*  like this can happen but again when you're talking about these millions and millions of people and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=477.64s)]
*  you start blocking off ways for people to get to the holy waters well people inevitably get upset [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  and in some cases we saw that barriers were being breached whether it was people that were climbing [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=490.32s)]
*  over them or just breaking through them altogether. Okay I think I can just see it looks like security [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  staff certainly walking in that scene there that we've put up for our viewers let's turn to the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  injured and where they're being being treated there were reports earlier that a lot of people [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=511.64s)]
*  attending this festival may not necessarily have had phones so I'm just wondering with reports as [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=516.88s)]
*  we're broadcasting on our BBC News website that access to hospitals being used to injure to treat [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=523.76s)]
*  those who are injured have has this news generally got out to those attending at the festival and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=533.28s)]
*  for other families further afield. It is a monumental task to try and reunite people that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=539.4s)]
*  have been separated and they have these centers that have been set up all along the Mela site [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=548.12s)]
*  and that's one challenge on a normal circumstance but in this circumstances for people to try and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=553.92s)]
*  get information about their loved ones that have gone to a hospital that you know sets up a whole [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=559.56s)]
*  other kind of challenge and that's certainly a question that's being put to officials look [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=564.64s)]
*  there are several hospitals around the city and the injured have been taking to them and whether [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=569.96s)]
*  or not they're going to be able to reunite with their loved ones is of course a question. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIhsDzJ-J_w&t=574.72s)]
