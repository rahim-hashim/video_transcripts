*  They call themselves men of steel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Shakhtar Stalevy, former soldiers, now footballers, and all of them amputees. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=4.4s)]
*  Vlad lost a leg in a mine explosion on the front line. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=12.0s)]
*  Just six months on, he's warming up for Ukraine's first ever amputee tournament. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=16.4s)]
*  The first time I played was really hard. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=22.2s)]
*  It was strange to run on crutches and so fast. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  Also, my right leg was always my strongest, and that's the one I lost. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=32.6s)]
*  So I had to learn to play all over again. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=37.2s)]
*  It's about positivity, the adrenaline, the team spirit. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=42.4s)]
*  It leaves your mood. You're on fire inside. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=47.0s)]
*  Olga was a military chef. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=52.6s)]
*  Now she's a striker for Kyiv, the only mixed team on the pitch. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=54.8s)]
*  I'm in shape now. My hands, arms, back are all getting strong. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  She'd left her baby with her mother and signed up. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=69.6s)]
*  She was injured when a shell landed as she slept. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=73.2s)]
*  I wanted to protect my family and didn't want a full-scale war. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=77.8s)]
*  Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  Then her husband went missing in action. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=87.0s)]
*  My husband has now been missing for two years. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=91.6s)]
*  So for me, this is like emotional rehab as well as physical. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=94.8s)]
*  Being back on the pitch has helped Dimitro cope too. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=100.6s)]
*  He was a professional footballer when he volunteered to fight. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=104.8s)]
*  Then he lost his leg trying to rescue other soldiers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=109.2s)]
*  We were told there were lots of casualties because they'd been ambushed, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=113.6s)]
*  and we had to get them out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=119.6s)]
*  We wound up in the same situation, hit with grenades, and every one of us was injured. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=121.4s)]
*  At first I couldn't cope, and I started drinking heavily. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=129.8s)]
*  I heard that Ukraine was launching amputee football teams, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=133.8s)]
*  and with football I returned to normal life. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=136.8s)]
*  That's why there are plans for more teams and more tournaments [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=141.8s)]
*  in a country where war has already created tens of thousands of amputees. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=145.8s)]
*  Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Kiev. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpniXWRXq4&t=151.8s)]
