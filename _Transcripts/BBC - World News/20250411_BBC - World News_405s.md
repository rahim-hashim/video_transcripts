Video Description: China has raised tariffs on US goods to 125% as the trade war with the US over Donald Trump's global tariffs escalates.

Beijing faces a 145% levy on some of its goods imported to the US.

President Xi Jinping called on the EU to join Beijing in opposing "bullying" from the US, and said "there are no winners in a tariff war".

Despite this, Donald Trump said he is still hoping to secure a deal with Beijing, adding they would "end up working something out that's very good for both countries".

# China raises tariffs on US goods to 125% as trade war ramps up | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc)
*  European stock markets have opened slightly higher in the past hour. The main indexes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=0.0s)]
*  in the UK, Germany, Spain and France all gained between 0.3 and 0.7 percent. On Thursday, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=5.54s)]
*  they registered their steepest one-day percentage gain since 2022. The news wasn't so positive [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=13.08s)]
*  across Asia. Uncertainty about President Trump's tariffs again affecting markets there. Japan's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Nikkei closed nearly 3 percent lower. Many investors are turning to gold, considered [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=26.92s)]
*  a safe investment. Its price hit a record high on Friday. The trade war between the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=32.32s)]
*  world's two largest economies, the US and China, has intensified, with Washington confirming [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  taxes of up to 145 percent on Beijing, which has responded with 84 percent tariffs of its [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  own. Mr. Trump told his cabinet on Thursday that a period of difficult transition was [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=51.84s)]
*  inevitable, but insisted investors were happy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=57.64s)]
*  Well, our correspondent Stephen McDonough explained how the government in Beijing was [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=81.84s)]
*  reacting to the tariffs. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=94.56s)]
*  Well, you know, Donald Trump has now said that actually the tariff on Chinese goods [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  is at 145 percent. The reason we're not going to get much of a response from the Chinese [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=102.12s)]
*  is that at this point it doesn't matter. You know, once you go past 100 percent tariffs [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=108.44s)]
*  on Chinese goods, it could be 200 percent, it could be 300 percent. It's all the same [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  because you're past 100 percent and it's already prohibitively high in terms of China selling [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=118.6s)]
*  goods into the US. So what this is seen as here is just a bit of bluster from Donald [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=124.36s)]
*  Trump. You know, he's stamping his feet because Xi Jinping won't talk to him. Well, guess [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=129.36s)]
*  what Xi Jinping is doing while he's ignoring Donald Trump. Today he sat down with the Spanish [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=134.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Next week he travels to Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=138.92s)]
*  These are all countries hit hard by Donald Trump's tariffs. You've got China's Commerce [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Minister speaking to their opposite numbers in South Africa and Saudi Arabia. We've got [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  the Indian Ambassador speaking to a Vice Premier here, also talking about China-India [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=158.04s)]
*  relations and on top of this China and the EU are apparently in talks to remove tariffs [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=165.04s)]
*  on Chinese cars going into Europe and replacing this with a sort of base price instead. What [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=170.28s)]
*  this all shows you is that China has options and really Donald Trump has misled his followers [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=177.0s)]
*  by saying, all I've got to do is whack these tariffs on China and Beijing will cave in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=183.6s)]
*  in a heartbeat. Well, I think the Chinese government has shown that is not going to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=188.72s)]
*  happen. And some breaking news coming in from Beijing now where Stephen McDonnell was speaking [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=192.64s)]
*  to us from, which is that the government is to raise additional tariffs on US goods to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=198.56s)]
*  125 percent. So initially it had talks of tariffs of 84 percent. The update now from [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=203.88s)]
*  the Chinese government is that it's going to raise tariffs on US goods to 125 percent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=211.84s)]
*  We can now bring in our Asia business correspondent, Mariko Ooi. Mariko, what's your reaction [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=218.44s)]
*  to that news from Beijing? Well, I think it'll be interesting to see how the European stock [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=223.6s)]
*  markets react to that breaking news. Obviously, the trade war between the world's two biggest [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=229.08s)]
*  economies has been escalating every day. But this is the latest twist. Beijing raising [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=236.04s)]
*  its territory tariffs to over 100 percent, basically meaning that any companies having [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=242.24s)]
*  to import would have to pay more than double. So many analysts have been telling us that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=247.84s)]
*  these tariffs are so high that it's almost impossible for any businesses making products [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  and trying to sell them in each other's countries to make a profit. So I think it's fair to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=258.12s)]
*  say that the damage to bilateral trade between the world's two biggest economy is pretty [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=263.04s)]
*  much almost done. The question has been among investors whether Beijing would resort to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=267.28s)]
*  other measures to retaliate. There are, of course, extreme measures as well as not so [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=273.0s)]
*  extreme measures. There were rumors of Beijing possibly banning the imports, for example, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=278.6s)]
*  of Hollywood movies. So we'll continue to monitor whether there will be other measures [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=283.16s)]
*  as well. But definitely this is further escalation of the trade tension. And it'll be interesting [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=286.96s)]
*  to see how those European markets, which, as you said, have opened flat to higher, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=291.8s)]
*  will react to it. And just some more information coming in from those Chinese tariffs. The [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=296.48s)]
*  government said that those tariffs will come into effect from Saturday. So those higher [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=303.6s)]
*  tariffs of 125 percent on U.S. goods to China now expected to come into effect on Saturday. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=308.44s)]
*  Mariko, the expectation was that these two countries would get to a point where perhaps [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=315.56s)]
*  would have negotiations that this trade war will come to an end. How long could this go [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=319.88s)]
*  on for? Well, I think many analysts were saying that Beijing wouldn't want to be seen to be [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  the weak one in this trade war and therefore they will not back down. Some were also saying [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=330.08s)]
*  that when the Chinese government starts quoting Mao Zedong, that really shows that they're [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=334.44s)]
*  not going to back down. They're going to fight this trade war to the end, as they have said [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  previously. And I think even if they were to sit at that negotiating table in the near [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=343.32s)]
*  future, some analysts were saying that they would try their best to damage the U.S. economy [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=348.96s)]
*  before they actually get to that negotiating table so they can start at a much stronger [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  position. So maybe that's what we're seeing at the moment. And of course, Asia and global [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  stock markets have been reacting to all these latest twists and turns in this trade war, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=364.28s)]
*  especially between the world's two biggest economies. And it has been an incredibly, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=369.88s)]
*  incredibly volatile week for Asian markets. Of course, they have mostly closed for trading [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=374.68s)]
*  today. We saw some losses even more. Japan's Nikkei 225, as he said, ending the day about [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=380.36s)]
*  three percent lower. Though some markets like Taiwan, which was one of the biggest losers, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=386.04s)]
*  they actually managed to rise. So it's not as a sharp sell-off that we saw earlier in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=390.21999999999997s)]
*  the week, but there have been quite a lot of wild swings in the stock market. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=394.92s)]
*  Indeed, Mariko, thank you. That's our Asia business correspondent, Mariko Ooi in Singapore there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeMFt34iJc&t=399.32s)]
