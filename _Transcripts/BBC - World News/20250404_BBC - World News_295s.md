Video Description: Israel’s army said it has launched a new ground offensive east of Gaza City, adding more areas which it calls security zones, to put pressure on Hamas to accept its terms for a ceasefire.
 
The Hamas-run health ministry has said 86 people have died in the last 24 hours.
 
Meanwhile, the UN says two-thirds of Gaza is under Israeli displacement orders or in no-go zones, and it’s been more than a month since aid supplies have been allowed into the territory.

*  Let's turn to the Middle East because Israel's army says it's launched a new ground offensive [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=2.0s)]
*  east of Gaza City, adding more of what he'd call security zones to put pressure on Hamas [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=6.68s)]
*  to accept its terms for a ceasefire. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=12.68s)]
*  Israel has rejected the truce it agreed back in January. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=15.36s)]
*  The Hamas-run health ministry says 86 people have died in the last 24 hours. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, the UN says two thirds of Gaza is now under Israeli displacement orders or [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=24.8s)]
*  in no-go zones, and it's been more than a month since aid supplies have been allowed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=29.96s)]
*  into the territory. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=35.56s)]
*  Let's speak to Clémence Lagouda, Oxfam's humanitarian coordinator there in Gaza, and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=37.4s)]
*  we're very grateful for your time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  I wonder if you could start by just telling viewers what you're currently dealing with [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=44.84s)]
*  there on the ground. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=52.08s)]
*  I mean, right now we are dealing on the worsening situation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=54.08s)]
*  It's deteriorating day by day, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to address the multiple [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=59.4s)]
*  needs of the population in Gaza because of the blockade. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=65.6s)]
*  As you mentioned, it's been more than a month that nothing has entered the Gaza Strip because [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=71.64s)]
*  of the sheer amount of forced displacement order. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  We are currently speaking about more than 280,000 people that had to leave their house [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=80.4s)]
*  under fire with very little. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  When was the last time Oxfam was actually able to get any sort of delivery in? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was before the beginning of March. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=96.64000000000001s)]
*  We had some wash, so water equipment that was supposed to enter on the day where Israel [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  imposed the full blockade. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=108.48s)]
*  So since then, we have been working with remaining stocks. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  We have been focusing on delivering services, but there is a need of more, and we're not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=114.52s)]
*  going to be able to continue that for much more longer if the situation doesn't improve. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=122.0s)]
*  What is most urgently needed? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=127.32s)]
*  Is it food? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=129.52s)]
*  Is it water? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=130.76s)]
*  Is it electricity? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=131.76s)]
*  Is it fuel? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=133.24s)]
*  Is it medical supplies? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=134.36s)]
*  Is it all of those things? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=135.88s)]
*  I think at this moment, it's all of these things and more. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  Again, we have more than 2 million women, children, and men that have been living on [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=142.12s)]
*  stocks for the past months, and these stocks are being depleted. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  Whether they are food, whether they are fuel that are actually the lifeline, because the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=153.32s)]
*  fuel right now is the one that allows hospitals to function and water pumping stations to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=158.72s)]
*  function. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=164.72s)]
*  If this fuel runs out, everything will shut down. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=165.88s)]
*  I mentioned before I came to you the various Israeli strikes and the no-go zones and the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=169.8s)]
*  areas now where people are being told to stay away from and the amount of displacement. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  How difficult is it for you as an organisation to actually work on the ground? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=182.88s)]
*  At what stage will you consider, or are you considering, staying in Gaza? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=189.08s)]
*  What we need to highlight here is that the biggest part of the team of Oxfam, which is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=197.44s)]
*  Gaza, is made of people from Gaza. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=202.96s)]
*  We are able to do the work that we are able to do because of their presence on the ground. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=205.96s)]
*  Right now, they are living and working under extremely harsh circumstances. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=211.0s)]
*  It's a struggle to go to the office. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=216.76s)]
*  They are afraid of if they come to the office, what will happen to their family? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  We are not given the guarantee right now to be able to operate safely. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=225.44s)]
*  The number of incidents against humanitarian workers has multiplied since the beginning [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=230.48s)]
*  or since the 18th of March, and this is extremely worrying. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=235.64s)]
*  Just a final question, and any of the agencies always want to steer clear of the politics. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=240.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to draw you into that, but in terms of what is your view on what the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=246.12s)]
*  international community is doing, given we've seen no aid getting in now for a month or [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=252.60000000000002s)]
*  so, what should the international community be doing in your view, do you think? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=259.36s)]
*  I mean, they need to speak up. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=264.04s)]
*  They need to remind and uphold international humanitarian law. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=267.04s)]
*  They need to demand accountability. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=272.08s)]
*  They need to speak out because the people in Gaza are being left alone and we are on [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=275.16s)]
*  the verge of a humanitarian disaster that is purely man-made and that could be avoided. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=282.24s)]
*  Clément, we will leave it there, but thank you for taking time, breaking away from that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=288.28s)]
*  work to talk to us here on BBC News. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FnWOk_xY4&t=292.56s)]
