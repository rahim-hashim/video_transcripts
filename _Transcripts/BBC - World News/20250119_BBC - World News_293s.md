Video Description: TikTok has gone offline in the US, hours before a new law banning the platform was due to come into effect.

A message appearing on the app for US users said a law banning TikTok had been enacted, meaning "you can't use TikTok for now".

The video-sharing app was banned over concerns about its links to the Chinese government and had been given a deadline of 19 January to be sold to an approved US buyer.

President Joe Biden had said he would leave the issue to his successor, Donald Trump. Trump has said he will "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a ban once he takes office on Monday.

# TikTok goes offline in US hours before ban due to come in | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64)
*  TikTok has stopped working in the United States. It's disappeared from Apple and Google [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=0.0s)]
*  app stores too, as part of a blackout ahead of a law implementing its shutdown. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  The US has cited national security concerns about the Chinese-owned video app, but President-elect [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=11.56s)]
*  Donald Trump has said he will probably give it a 90-day reprieve from the ban. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=17.52s)]
*  Well, let's speak to a North America technology correspondent, Lily Jamali, who's in San Francisco [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=22.8s)]
*  for us. So Lily, just tell us what happens when people in America try to access TikTok at the moment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=28.32s)]
*  Well, I can tell you from personal experience, because I have it pulled up right here on my [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=35.68s)]
*  phone, that I'm getting a message that says, sorry, TikTok isn't available right now. And I imagine [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=39.36s)]
*  the 170 million other American users are now getting that very same message. It then says [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=45.6s)]
*  that a law banning TikTok has been enacted. That's part of the story here. That's part of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=51.76s)]
*  the law that was passed by Congress last year, which you mentioned, went through on national [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=58.96s)]
*  security grounds concerns about Chinese ownership of the app. But left out in this statement [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=63.68s)]
*  by TikTok is the fact that TikTok and its Chinese owner, they've had nine months to sell this app [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=70.4s)]
*  to a U.S. buyer, and they didn't do that. Of course, both of these options are clearly unsavory to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=76.32s)]
*  the company. But at this point, they have exhausted every legal avenue at their disposal. They've [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=83.36s)]
*  taken this to a U.S. appeals court where the law was upheld. The Supreme Court did the same on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  Friday. They do, of course, have an ally, as you noted, in President-elect Donald Trump, who takes [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  office the day after, so tomorrow on Monday. And he, as you mentioned, has said he will try to enact [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=101.44s)]
*  a, he's likely to, is the phrasing that he used, to enact a reprieve of about three months. The [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=108.88s)]
*  question is whether legally he can actually do that. And so why has the company chosen to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=115.2s)]
*  affect this ban, even though it has a very powerful ally in Donald Trump? Talk us through the ecosystem [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=121.84s)]
*  about how Americans access TikTok and the companies that could have been liable if they'd [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=128.64s)]
*  continue making it accessible. Well, as of right now, this law is in force. Donald Trump is not the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=133.44s)]
*  president. Joe Biden is the president, as you know. And even though Joe Biden has said, his [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  administration has said that they will not enforce this law, companies involved here are technically [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=146.56s)]
*  flouting the law if they continued to uphold the status quo. So that would include companies like [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=153.6s)]
*  Oracle, the web hosting service. They basically have all this data on their servers. And so they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=159.28s)]
*  have taken action, presumably. You mentioned the app stores. So Apple and Google administer the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  biggest app stores in the United States, where most Americans go to put the app, to put TikTok [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=173.92s)]
*  on their devices. These various aspects of the ecosystem, these different companies, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=180.4s)]
*  all faced legal action if they didn't do something as of Sunday. And they also faced potentially very [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=186.88s)]
*  steep fines. So yes, Donald Trump comes into office on Monday and can tell these various companies [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=195.36s)]
*  that he can try and assure them, but they are still flouting the law if they didn't do something. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=205.28s)]
*  And talk to us about the possible individuals or companies that could buy the TikTok operations [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=210.88s)]
*  in the United States, and crucially, some allies of Donald Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=217.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's a number of potential suitors that have come forward, most recently Perplexity AI, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=221.76s)]
*  which is one of the many AI startups that has cropped up in recent years. But individuals [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  include Donald Trump's former Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who floated, he was interested [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=233.76s)]
*  earlier this year when the law first took effect. Another prominent suitor is a billionaire investor [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=240.16s)]
*  named Frank McCourt, who has put a group of investors together. He has made the media rounds, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=248.24s)]
*  done a lot of interviews talking about what he'd like to do with the app. But the most probably [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=253.92s)]
*  well-known and most interesting, I would say, of the potential suitors here is Elon Musk. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  He, of course, owns X, formerly known as Twitter. He is a close ally of Donald Trump, campaigned for [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump in the run-up to November's election, and also contributed about a quarter billion [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=273.36s)]
*  dollars to Donald Trump's re-election campaign. There is talk that he might take over by TikTok [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=278.96s)]
*  and potentially merge it with what was once known as Twitter. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYON39EVN64&t=286.8s)]
