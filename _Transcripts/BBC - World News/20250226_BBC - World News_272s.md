Video Description: Israeli and Hamas officials have said the latest setback in the Gaza ceasefire deal has been resolved by mediators.
 
Israel had delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday in protest at what it said was the cruel treatment of Israeli hostages being handed over by Hamas. 
 
Hamas said this was a serious violation of the deal.
 
It is now expected that the prisoners will be freed as well as another group, possibly later on Wednesday or Thursday, in exchange for the return of the bodies of four hostages.
