# Taliban official: 'War in Afghanistan should end soon' - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI)
*  As the war is difficult, peace is more difficult than war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=0.0s)]
*  And the problem, especially the conflict, the war which is going on in Afghanistan for the last four decades, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=4.0s)]
*  giving an end to it, cannot be overnight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=12.0s)]
*  We still hope, we are very keen from our side, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=15.0s)]
*  that as soon as it is possible, the war should end in Afghanistan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=20.0s)]
*  The same thing I see now with the American side also, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=24.0s)]
*  because this Trump administration, they are more keen to withdraw their forces from Afghanistan [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=28.0s)]
*  and bring peace in Afghanistan. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=37.0s)]
*  And there are many Afghan civilians who have lost family members through Taliban attacks. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=38.0s)]
*  What message would you send to them? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=43.0s)]
*  They might be saying, we don't want these guys to come back. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=46.0s)]
*  There are not lots of civilians. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=50.0s)]
*  The United Nations says you're responsible for more deaths than any other. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=52.0s)]
*  The United Nations and all those medias which are working in Afghanistan, they are not free. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=55.0s)]
*  Whatever the report they give, we are not agree with that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=61.0s)]
*  I've been in Kabul, I've seen the aftermath of a bomb that goes off in the centre of the city. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=64.0s)]
*  And you must know that there will be civilian casualties. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=69.0s)]
*  I say that I do not deny that there are no civil casualties. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=72.0s)]
*  There are civil casualties, but less, not that much which is coming in the media. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=77.0s)]
*  But still, I say that we are trying our best to prevent this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=82.0s)]
*  Now, the last time the Taliban were in power, girls weren't allowed to go to school, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=87.0s)]
*  women weren't allowed to work. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=91.0s)]
*  What would be the fate of women in the future of Afghanistan? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=93.0s)]
*  The Taliban is a mainstream political player. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=98.0s)]
*  On the women's side, all those rights which are according to the Islamic rule [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=100.0s)]
*  and also the Afghan culture, Afghani culture, this will be granted to them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=105.0s)]
*  And this is their right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=110.0s)]
*  So they can work, they can go to school? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=112.0s)]
*  Yes, I'm telling you. They can go to school, they can go to universities, they can work. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=113.0s)]
*  Now, I want to ask you a question that you might not expect. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=119.0s)]
*  Why take part in talks? Why not continue fighting? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=122.0s)]
*  We know that we have already experienced that in the past also. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=126.0s)]
*  So occupying the whole country, taking the whole country by power will not help [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=131.0s)]
*  because it will not bring peace in Afghanistan. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=136.0s)]
*  We don't want to have a victory completely militarily. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=139.0s)]
*  So we wanted to solve this thing on the table in a peaceful manner [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=144.0s)]
*  so that after the withdrawal of the foreign forces, there should be no fighting among Afghans. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=148.0s)]
*  There should be peace forever. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=152.0s)]
*  And does the issue of international legitimacy matter to you? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=154.0s)]
*  Do you think that if you come to a peaceful resolution, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=158.0s)]
*  it will be easier for a future government to have better relations with countries around the world? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=161.0s)]
*  Last time, only a handful of countries recognised the Taliban. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=167.0s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=171.0s)]
*  If the future government comes in Afghanistan and the majority support that government, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=173.0s)]
*  I'm very much optimistic that it will be recognised by the whole world. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=178.0s)]
*  And it will have good relations, especially with the neighbours, with the region, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=183.0s)]
*  with the whole world, even with the United States. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=187.0s)]
*  We have told Mr Khalilzad and his team that we want the withdrawal of your forces from Afghanistan, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=190.0s)]
*  but we want to be friends with you in future so that the Americans should come back to Afghanistan [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=196.0s)]
*  and work with us in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2QhECbTtI&t=203.0s)]
