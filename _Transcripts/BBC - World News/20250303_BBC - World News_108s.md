**BBC - World News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU)
*  Breaking news this lunchtime. Police in the German city of Mannheim say a car has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=0.0s)]
*  rammed into a crowd of people and at least one person has been killed. There [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=4.54s)]
*  are reports that several more have been injured. A large security operation is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=8.76s)]
*  underway. Our reporter Danny Eberhard joins us now. Danny what more do we know [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=12.64s)]
*  at this stage? Well the police so far haven't confirmed whether this is some [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=17.22s)]
*  sort of accident or an attack. The presumption at this stage is that it [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=21.96s)]
*  would be an attack. We don't know how many people have been injured and we [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=25.62s)]
*  all we know from the police is that they've advising residents to stay away [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=31.78s)]
*  from the city centre of Mannheim. Mannheim is about 70 kilometers or so [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=37.42s)]
*  south southwest of Frankfurt in the west of Germany. It's carnival time in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  Germany and today is called Rose Monday so it's an important carnival day. There [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  is a carnival market in Mannheim that's taking place and it appears from [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=52.9s)]
*  preliminary reports at least that this may have been the focus of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=56.82s)]
*  incident. The police are drafting in lots of reinforcements and there are also [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  ambulances at the scene and rescue personnel and there are warnings [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=66.7s)]
*  going out that it's a life-threatening situation there. We've also heard from [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=72.1s)]
*  police that they have arrested one person so it's a fast-moving situation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=76.34s)]
*  and obviously Germany is on high alert at the moment with a string of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=80.7s)]
*  previous terror-related incidents, for example the car attack on a Christmas [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=85.46000000000001s)]
*  market in Magdeburg in December in which six people were killed and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  almost 300 people injured. So it's high alert and we've just come out of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=96.26s)]
*  German elections so it's a tense situation in Germany at the moment. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=102.34s)]
*  Danny, thank you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzdjIng0qUU&t=105.94s)]
