Women have recalled being raped at a prison in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, as chaos broke out after rebels advanced on Goma city.

Rwandan-backed M23 rebels closed in on the city on 27 January after a rapid advance through the region.

By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out of the prison - they had also apparently started a fire which tore through the compound as they tried to escape - but few of the women managed to get away. 

A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death according to two sources.

A UN official told the BBC that "at least 153 women had perished", quoting "reliable sources in the prison".

**BBC - World News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE)
*  Survivors of a devastating prison fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo have told the BBC they want justice but don't expect to get it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=0.0s)]
*  132 women and 26 children burned to death in the fire, which is thought was started by male inmates trying to escape. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=8.56s)]
*  It happened in the eastern city of Goma as M23 fighters, who were backed by neighbouring Rwanda, advanced across the country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=17.16s)]
*  Our senior international correspondent Ola Geirin sent this report a warning you may find some of it distressing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=25.52s)]
*  Back to a place of horror. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=35.12s)]
*  Two survivors return to Goma's central prison for the first time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=38.16s)]
*  Pascaleen and Nadine want to tell their stories and have chosen to be filmed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Both say they were accused of minor offences and jailed without being convicted. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=51.36s)]
*  They enter the main yard of the women's prison, where many used to sleep crammed together. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=59.68s)]
*  Within these walls, women and children were screaming for help when fire broke out in the night. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=67.76s)]
*  No one came. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  Their jailers had fled, fearing the rebel advance. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=76.8s)]
*  A month on, there are human remains among the ashes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=83.6s)]
*  And for these women, another trauma. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=90.44s)]
*  They tell us they were among many raped here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=93.64s)]
*  Pascaleen says by prisoners who came over the wall from the block next door. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  I was raped, violently, and passed out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=108.76s)]
*  While the second man was raping me, I came to. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=115.2s)]
*  He told me he would kill me if I tried to escape. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=119.88s)]
*  The unlucky ones were raped. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=124.08s)]
*  The lucky ones got out without being raped. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=127.12s)]
*  The prison was engulfed by chaos. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=134.36s)]
*  There was a mass jailbreak from the men's section, thousands of prisoners making a getaway. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=139.76s)]
*  But the women were still trapped, among them Nadine, who saw many take their last breaths. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=148.0s)]
*  Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals in the prison. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  When I sleep at night, everything comes back to me. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=164.32s)]
*  I see the dead again. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=168.72s)]
*  All the bodies I saw before I got out. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=171.84s)]
*  Among the dead, there were 26 children. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=178.6s)]
*  The oldest, just seven. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  A witness told us some started to die when police fired tear gas into the prison, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=184.84s)]
*  though it was already ablaze. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  In Agoma Hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=196.76s)]
*  She was pulled from the flames by a friend, but couldn't save Esther, her two-year-old daughter. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=201.72s)]
*  I had Esther on my back, she says, when we wanted to escape and something fell on her. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=209.76s)]
*  A bomb? I don't know. She died on the spot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  She tells me Esther was just starting to walk and was without sin. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=225.28s)]
*  The full story of what happened here may never be known, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=233.16s)]
*  but we do know that women and children were trapped here, locked inside, unable to escape. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  And survivors have told us they do not expect justice. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=244.56s)]
*  The prison now stands as a silent reminder of those who died here [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  and an indictment of those who let them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cvDyvNmlE&t=255.64000000000001s)]
