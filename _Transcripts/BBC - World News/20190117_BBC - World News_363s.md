**BBC - World News:** [January 17, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs)
*  Six-year-old Zainab was last seen alive in this CCTV footage, being led away from a street [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=0.0s)]
*  near her home by the man who had murdered her. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=8.64s)]
*  She was one of over half a dozen victims of a serial child killer loose in the city of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=13.68s)]
*  Qasoud. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  When her body was discovered days later, furious crowds poured out into the streets, blaming [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  the police for not doing enough to stop the attacks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=28.88s)]
*  The case dominated headlines. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=34.32s)]
*  In a socially conservative country, many hoped the attention would raise awareness about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=36.76s)]
*  child abuse. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=41.72s)]
*  Now, a year on, I want to see whether the tragic murders here have had a lasting impact. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=43.72s)]
*  Zainab's mother still keeps her daughter's school uniform in the room they once shared. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=51.32s)]
*  She tells me she's struggling to come to terms with her loss. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=58.8s)]
*  You know what mothers are like. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  If someone even slaps your child, it hurts you so much. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=68.0s)]
*  This is the man who killed Zainab, 24-year-old Imran Ali. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  He was arrested, then executed last October. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Zainab's family believe they have now received justice, but say more still needs to be done [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=81.36s)]
*  to prevent other children being abused. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  There are still so many incidents happening. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=94.48s)]
*  We need more CCTV cameras, and the government should introduce a program into the school [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  curriculum raising awareness about child abuse. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=101.44s)]
*  I don't think anything has changed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=106.76s)]
*  The situation is just as bad as it was before. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=109.04s)]
*  As soon as you turn the TV on, you hear stories of other cases like ours. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=112.84s)]
*  I can't bear to watch them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=117.56s)]
*  The children have different names, but I feel as if they are saying Zainab's name. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=119.64s)]
*  Everyone says have patience, but I ask them, where can I get patience from? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=125.04s)]
*  I still feel Zainab's presence at home. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=130.4s)]
*  Zainab's body was discovered in this rubbish dump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=139.12s)]
*  She was one of eight young girls to be attacked by the same man. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=141.72s)]
*  The case did provoke a national discussion on child abuse, but many here still don't [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=145.88s)]
*  feel comfortable talking openly about the subject, and victims often don't get the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  support that they need. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=155.16s)]
*  This man's daughter was assaulted by the same man who killed Zainab. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=159.16s)]
*  She survived, but is still recovering from her ordeal. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=163.78s)]
*  We aren't showing his face to protect his daughter's identity. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=167.2s)]
*  If a door slams, she gets scared. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=173.12s)]
*  Anytime she sees a stranger, she is terrified. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=175.52s)]
*  She runs inside the house and closes the door. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=180.68s)]
*  If anyone even raises their voice, she gets scared. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=183.72s)]
*  She's been like that ever since the incident. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=187.8s)]
*  Her father says they were given some financial compensation, but have never been offered [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=191.44s)]
*  psychological support. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  His daughter was even told to visit the attacker in jail to try and identify him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=198.04s)]
*  He was inside his cell. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=205.32s)]
*  The judge was there as well as two policemen. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=207.2s)]
*  She started shaking and gasping for breath. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=212.48s)]
*  You thought your daughter shouldn't have gone to jail to see him? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  No, she shouldn't have gone. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=221.32s)]
*  At this school in Kasood, they are now taking action. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=223.0s)]
*  The head teacher is talking to pupils about what to do if someone tries to touch them [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=232.08s)]
*  inappropriately. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=236.64s)]
*  It's part of a new scheme in the city introduced in the past few weeks. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=237.64s)]
*  Newly appointed deputy commissioner Wasima Uma is the official behind the project. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=244.44s)]
*  What is important is that we communicate. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  We communicate with our children at home, at school. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=252.58s)]
*  Also awareness is the key. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=257.18s)]
*  We need to talk about issues that at the moment are no-go zones. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=260.14s)]
*  Has that become easier after the publicity around the Zeynep case? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=265.86s)]
*  Highlighting the Zeynep case of course has helped us in bringing more focus on how parents [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=269.38s)]
*  and teachers should pay attention to what is happening with the children once they are [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=277.54s)]
*  out of homes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  She says they've also introduced a counselling service for victims in the last month. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=285.26000000000005s)]
*  When I told her we had spoken to families who had never been offered support, she promised [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=290.1s)]
*  to take action. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=294.38s)]
*  What we are going to do is reach out to those families, talk to those children. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=295.38s)]
*  I personally would like to see them and counsel them because I've been a student of psychology [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=300.62s)]
*  myself. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=307.62s)]
*  According to one leading charity, on average around 12 children are abused every day in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=309.9s)]
*  Pakistan. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=314.66s)]
*  At times, some end up repeating the behaviour, creating a vicious cycle. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=315.66s)]
*  A source involved in the investigation into Zeynep's murder told me the killer himself [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=321.86s)]
*  had been abused throughout his childhood. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=327.06s)]
*  It's hard to think of someone responsible for so many horrific crimes as having once [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=329.9s)]
*  been a victim. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  But perhaps if he'd been able to access support when he was younger, none of this would have [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  ever happened. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=340.46s)]
*  On the anniversary of Zeynep's death, her father has organised a rally in memory of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=345.38s)]
*  his daughter. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=349.46s)]
*  The government has promised to pass a bill named after her, improving the way police [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=350.85999999999996s)]
*  deal with child abuse cases. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=354.62s)]
*  Her parents and residents here hope some good can come out of this tragedy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrLYGLCXhCs&t=356.62s)]
