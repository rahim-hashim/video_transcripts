Video Description: It's been just over three years since Mariupol was taken by Russian forces after a brutal siege and indiscriminate bombardment â€“ a key moment in the early months of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Thousands were killed, and the UN estimated 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed.
In recent months, videos and reels from several pro-Russia influencers have been painting a picture of a glossy city where damaged structures have been repaired and where life has gone back to normal.
But the BBC has spoken to more than half a dozen people - some still living in Mariupol, others who escaped after spending time under occupation - to piece together a real picture of what life is like in the city.

# Residents of Ukraine's Mariupol deny Russian claims occupied city returning to normal | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA)
*  Now as the fighting between Russia and Ukraine continues, President Putin suggested a new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=0.0s)]
*  round of peace talks could bring a long-awaited ceasefire. The prospect of a halt in fighting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=4.8s)]
*  is deeply worrying to Ukrainians living under Russian control. However, Russia now occupies [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=10.32s)]
*  just under 20% of Ukraine, mainly districts in the east. The BBC's managed to communicate with [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=15.52s)]
*  some Ukrainians in one city there, Mariupol, and along with a testimony of those who've escaped, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=21.84s)]
*  we've pieced together the details of daily life. The city's Russian administration did not respond [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=28.0s)]
*  to the BBC's questions. Yogi Tulamai has this report. A city bathed in Russian colours, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=34.16s)]
*  these are some of the most recent available images from occupied Mariupol. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=42.4s)]
*  Celebrations for World War II Victory Day, military costumes, parades and performances. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Soviet-era traditions that Ukraine had increasingly shunned, now imposed in occupied territories. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  This footage, filmed by pro-Russia influencers, paints a picture of a city that's being [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=64.56s)]
*  reconstructed. The exteriors of the buildings on the main street, including this drama theatre, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=69.84s)]
*  where hundreds were killed as they sheltered in a targeted Russian bombardment, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=76.4s)]
*  show barely any sign of the brutal war fought to capture Mariupol. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=81.2s)]
*  But from just outside the city centre, this video, verified by the BBC, shows large areas [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=86.4s)]
*  still in ruins. A reality that Olha Onishko, who escaped from Mariupol after more than two [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=93.04s)]
*  years of living under occupation, also testifies to. She's now in Ukraine's Ternopil. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  The Russians constantly lie. They have repaired the central square, but the rest of Mariupol [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  is still destroyed. They cleared the debris in some places. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=114.32s)]
*  Dead bodies were piled onto trucks, along with the rubble and taken out. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=118.8s)]
*  This footage is secretly filmed by Ukrainians in Mariupol, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  waging a resistance against Russia, showing how they're living, with dirty tap water, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  barely any electricity and poor phone networks. And in schools in and around Mariupol, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=135.28s)]
*  young students are being taught Russia's narrative of events. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=142.64s)]
*  Here, the annexation of Crimea presented as the Crimean Spring, in which Russia liberated it from [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=147.04s)]
*  Ukraine. It's too risky for Ukrainian activists in Mariupol to speak out openly. We communicated [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=153.6s)]
*  with them over a messaging platform. Children are told that Mariupol is eternally Russian land [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=160.72s)]
*  and that Russia saved it from the Nazis. Teachers who refuse to take these lessons are fired [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  or intimidated. It's like a reprogramming of the minds of our children. The activists also told us [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=172.48s)]
*  about their operations. These are secret videos taken by one of them. I document information about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Russian weapons, ammunition depots and soldiers. I also paste leaflets and spray paint messages on [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  walls. This is one leaflet which says liberate Mariupol. And this is video of a railway signaling [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=194.64s)]
*  system being set on fire by resistance groups, disrupting a key train line into the city. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=203.44s)]
*  But Russia is trying to crack down on the resistance. In Ukraine's Dnipro, we met Andriy [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Kozhushin, who worked for one of the groups. He escaped Mariupol when the Russians found out about [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  him. I was at a store buying bread when I saw a soldier showing my photo to the cashier asking [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=223.12s)]
*  if they knew the person. I realized then that I had been exposed and decided to leave. And from [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=230.08s)]
*  inside Mariupol a message. Giving away territory for a deal with Russia will be a betrayal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=236.8s)]
*  Dozens risk their lives every day to pass information to Ukraine. Not so that some [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=245.36s)]
*  diplomat in a suit will sign a paper that will hand us over. We don't want peace at any cost. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=251.36s)]
*  We want liberation. Yulia Prylina, BBC News, Ukraine. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAiPnw_torA&t=258.64s)]
