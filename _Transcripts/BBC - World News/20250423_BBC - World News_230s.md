Video Description: Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to "significantly" cut back his role in the US government after the electric car firm reported a huge drop in profit and sales for the start of this year.
Musk had led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) since last year, which put the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.
But Musk said his "time allocation to Doge" would "drop significantly" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.
His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.

# Elon Musk to reduce US government role after Tesla profits plunge | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY)
*  So let's begin with Tesla. The company's revenues and profits have plunged during the first three [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=0.0s)]
*  months of the year as the automaker faces continued backlash over its boss Elon Musk's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=5.92s)]
*  association with the Trump administration, sparking protests and boycotts of Tesla around the world. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=11.28s)]
*  So if we look at the numbers, the company reported a 20% drop in its automotive revenues in the first [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  quarter of this year compared to the same time last year and profits during that time fell [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=25.2s)]
*  more than 70%. The car giant warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=32.0s)]
*  a forecast going forward while saying changing political sentiment could meaningfully hurt demand. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=39.04s)]
*  In a call to investors on Tuesday, Elon Musk announced he would cut back his role in the Trump [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=46.16s)]
*  administration and focus more on his time at Tesla. Our North America technology correspondent, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=51.36s)]
*  Lily Jamali, has more details. Elon Musk acknowledged on a conference call on Tuesday [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=58.24s)]
*  that politics has affected Tesla's falling fortunes. He talked about his work at DOGE, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=64.8s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiency. That's not a real US federal department, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=70.72s)]
*  but it is an initiative aimed at slashing government spending. Musk's aggressive approach [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=75.36s)]
*  has included sacking large groups of federal workers at once and also sifting through the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=81.6s)]
*  sensitive data of American citizens, data that's held by the government, which he now has access [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=87.44s)]
*  to. And all of this has sparked what he himself termed a blowback. Protests at Tesla dealerships [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=93.84s)]
*  have become a common occurrence and longtime fans and investors have turned their backs on Tesla [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=100.4s)]
*  because of all of this political activity by Elon Musk. On Tuesday, Musk blasted his detractors. He [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=107.68s)]
*  blasted those protesters saying that his work at DOGE is critical and that it is mostly done, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=115.2s)]
*  in his words. He plans to spend quite a bit less time on DOGE starting next month in May. Now, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=122.0s)]
*  one investor that I spoke to said it didn't matter that Musk's turn towards far-right politics [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=129.04s)]
*  has permanently harmed Tesla, which he said is now a broken company. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=135.44s)]
*  Lily Jamali there. I also talked to Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Securities to get his take on the results. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=146.72s)]
*  You come out along with Nvidia, one of the most disruptive technology companies in the world, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=150.48s)]
*  but we thought the brand destruction is real. This was a moment of truth. Musk had to basically [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=155.2s)]
*  pick Tesla or DOGE. This is, I believe, the beginning of the end of his stand with the Trump [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  White House and he doubled down on Tesla CEO. That's probably the most important thing from [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  the earnings call. Tesla shares did go up in after hours trade a little bit in comparison to how much [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  they've dropped this year. But there's other issues like, for example, I was reading 80% of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=182.96s)]
*  Tesla's lithium batteries are made in China. There are lots of problems looking ahead and they would [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=188.16s)]
*  not give an outlook figure for Tesla. Look, they're caught in the eye of the storm. I mean, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=194.96s)]
*  in terms of tariffs and obviously, Tesla's become a political symbol globally in terms of the Trump [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=200.88s)]
*  administration and DOGE. And that's demand destruction. And they are right now needing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=208.0s)]
*  to deal with some of those headwinds. And that's why Tesla needs Musk full time. It was a step [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=214.56s)]
*  forward, but still challenges ahead. It's about autonomous robotics. But look, this is a chapter [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  that Musk needs to navigate Tesla through. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5COb1uFPY&t=226.39999999999998s)]
