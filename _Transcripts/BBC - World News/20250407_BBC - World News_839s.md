# What is the stock market and how does it work? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0)
*  Joining me now is the BBC's business editor Simon Jack and Laura Davidson, political editor from Bloomberg News. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Laura, Simon, thank you very much indeed for being with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=7.0s)]
*  Obviously we're seeing the turmoil on the markets continue today, Monday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=10.0s)]
*  Simon, just in terms of understanding the basics here, can you explain to us how a stock market index works? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=15.0s)]
*  OK, so if we were to take our own stock market index, the biggest one, which is the FTSE 100, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=22.0s)]
*  100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, they were all put in a big bucket back in 1984 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=27.0s)]
*  and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=33.0s)]
*  And it was set at a level of 1,000 back in 1984. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=38.0s)]
*  Now since then companies come, companies have gone, there's been takeovers and mergers, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=42.0s)]
*  but generally speaking there's been 100 of the biggest companies [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=46.0s)]
*  and basically the stock market is a reflection of their sort of total value over time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=49.0s)]
*  The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index, same in the US. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=56.0s)]
*  So you'll see, for example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=60.0s)]
*  And in the US you've seen the S&P 500, which is the 500 biggest companies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=65.0s)]
*  You've seen enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia, etc., Amazon, what have you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=70.0s)]
*  And so what the stock market tells you is generally the direction of travel of most of the shares [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=76.0s)]
*  and the value of the shares in those companies with a concentration on those biggest names. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=83.0s)]
*  And a lot of people say one of the problems with the US stock market in recent years [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=91.0s)]
*  is those few big tech companies have had an overweening influence on the whole thing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=95.0s)]
*  But generally speaking it's an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=99.0s)]
*  and whether they get up or down tells you something about the sentiment [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=103.0s)]
*  of whether you think that their profits are going to rise or fall in the future. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=106.0s)]
*  Thank you. And Laura, obviously we're seeing the falls continue today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=110.0s)]
*  And when we talk about a correction, can you explain what that means in practice? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=114.0s)]
*  How much are companies, political leaders, waiting to see whether there's a negotiated deal? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=119.0s)]
*  Because everyone's, I guess, wondering where the bottom is, where the level might lie at [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=125.0s)]
*  and whether the market will recover. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=130.0s)]
*  Yeah, so that is really the unknown question right now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=133.0s)]
*  About $5 trillion has been zapped from markets and again markets overseas are down [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=136.0s)]
*  and we are waiting for markets in the US to open here in just about an hour and a half. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=142.0s)]
*  We'll get a sense of where things are headed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=146.0s)]
*  What we can expect is more volatility. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=148.0s)]
*  There's a meeting today, later today, with Netanyahu at the White House with President Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=151.0s)]
*  And there's a question of will there be some sort of relief from tariffs that will be announced there? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=157.0s)]
*  The US and Israel are very close allies. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=162.0s)]
*  So a close watching there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=164.0s)]
*  We got a little bit of a sense of kind of how markets are reacting. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=166.0s)]
*  On Friday when Trump said he had spoken with the Vietnamese and they had, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=169.0s)]
*  that the US officials had spoken with Vietnamese officials and there was some, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=173.0s)]
*  potentially a deal in the works for Vietnam which has been hit with this 46% tariff by the US, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=177.0s)]
*  which is quite a significant level, that they would reduce all to zero, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=183.0s)]
*  all of their tariffs on US goods going into that country. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=187.0s)]
*  We saw as a reaction stocks like Nike and Lululemon actually increased on that news [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=190.0s)]
*  because these are apparel makers that have a very big presence there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=197.0s)]
*  So each, broadly I believe we're going to see markets down, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=200.0s)]
*  but you could see particular stocks, particular things moving in a more positive direction [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=203.0s)]
*  as there's indications that there may be some exemptions that are allowed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=208.0s)]
*  We don't know that Trump will allow that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=212.0s)]
*  He sent some mixed signals at times saying that his policies will never change, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=214.0s)]
*  but then also suggesting that some deals are possible. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=217.0s)]
*  And just before I start looking at some of today's reaction, reaction over the weekend, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=220.0s)]
*  Simon, to relate this to all of us, what happens if stocks continue to fall for our pension funds [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=224.0s)]
*  or for other aspects of daily life? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=235.0s)]
*  OK, I think there are two things to stress here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=237.0s)]
*  What happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=240.0s)]
*  They can be linked, but they're not exactly the same. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=244.0s)]
*  Some people invest directly in shares and this will definitely affect them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=246.0s)]
*  These are some big falls, some of the biggest falls we've seen in a couple of days [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=250.0s)]
*  since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=253.0s)]
*  The other way that people are exposed to this is through their pension funds. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=257.0s)]
*  Now, pension fund investing is a long-term game. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=262.0s)]
*  Not all of your money will go into shares. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=265.0s)]
*  Some of it will go into government bonds. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=269.0s)]
*  And the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=271.0s)]
*  in things like cash and government bonds, the less this will affect you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=274.0s)]
*  There are also two types of pension, a defined benefit pension, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=278.0s)]
*  where you get a price promise, a percentage of your salary in retirement, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=281.0s)]
*  and there's defined contribution, where your pension pot's value will rise and fall [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=284.0s)]
*  with financial markets. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=288.0s)]
*  So yes, people's pensions are exposed, but I think that this is a long-term game, pension investing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=290.0s)]
*  We've seen things like this before, a few years ago during the pandemic. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=294.0s)]
*  I think what's more important, the warning sign flashing here is not about the value of your pension pot. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=298.0s)]
*  It's what's going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=303.0s)]
*  And a lot of people saying that the chances of a recession, both in the US, UK, and even globally, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=307.0s)]
*  have definitely gone up a notch since then, and that has implications for things like jobs and wages. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=312.0s)]
*  Okay, we'll come back to define a recession in a moment maybe. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=317.0s)]
*  But Laura, just let me bring a little bit of the reaction that we've had today, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=320.0s)]
*  which raises another couple of questions, because economy ministers from across the European Union [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=326.0s)]
*  are meeting in Luxembourg to discuss a response to the US tariffs. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=331.0s)]
*  Let me just play you a brief clip of the German economics minister Robert Habeck [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=335.0s)]
*  responding to a question about how Donald Trump came to those calculations, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=340.0s)]
*  those original figures for how he is imposing these taxes and tariffs. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=344.0s)]
*  The calculations, from my point of view, are nonsense. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=350.0s)]
*  Even the basis of the calculation is nonsense. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=354.0s)]
*  This raises the assumption that a trade budget surplus or deficit is a problem in itself, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=357.0s)]
*  is a wrong estimation, because in the end globalization serves all economies, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=364.0s)]
*  and especially the American economy has huge growth figures in GDP better than a lot of European countries. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=371.0s)]
*  So you see, if we, the rest of the world, are selling cheaper goods to the American economy, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=379.0s)]
*  it's abuse of the American economy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=384.0s)]
*  So even the basis of the calculation, as Hacha put it, the economical, philosophical basis, is nonsense. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=386.0s)]
*  And then we have seen that the countries who tried to ease the conflicts beforehand with the US [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=394.0s)]
*  and hoped for a reduction of tariffs or being excluded from tariffs are wrong. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=402.0s)]
*  This has not happened. So I can only say to the European partners, we have to stay united. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=413.0s)]
*  If you try to solve the problem on your own, this will not be successful. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=419.0s)]
*  So Laura, the basis of that original calculation and some of the assumptions politically, even and economically, that lie behind it, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=425.0s)]
*  what would you say to that clip that we just heard? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=433.0s)]
*  Yeah, so what the White House did in determining all of these rates, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=437.0s)]
*  originally Trump has talked about these as reciprocal tariffs, that the White House was going to add up all of the tariff [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=440.0s)]
*  and trade barriers that certain countries charge on US goods going in, and they would basically hit back with that same level. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=445.0s)]
*  That's not exactly what they did. That's actually a very complicated calculation to do. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=452.0s)]
*  Instead, they looked at essentially what the trade deficit is between the US and that country. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=456.0s)]
*  Trump, for years, literally going back four decades, has been very perturbed by the idea of trade deficits, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=461.0s)]
*  that he wants to see more manufacturing in the US, more goods going abroad, and that there's essentially equal trade between the US and other countries. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=468.0s)]
*  Of course, it's a very difficult thing to achieve. The US is a very consumer-driven economy. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=476.0s)]
*  It's a very big economy and a lot of manufacturing of things that people use every day, things like clothes, toys, shoes, household wares, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=480.0s)]
*  are pretty much exclusively made overseas, not to mention things that can't be grown, like bananas or other products that people eat, coffee. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=488.0s)]
*  This is really at the crux of the issue and the economic conundrum that we find ourselves in, is that Trump does not like trade deficits. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=496.0s)]
*  That's what we've seen underlying these tariffs. This has been something he has railed against ever since well before he was into politics. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=504.0s)]
*  This is an idea that he's been thinking about for a long time during his first term. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=512.0s)]
*  He imposed some tariffs, but they were a lot more narrow in scope and size, and you didn't see quite the market impact that you saw here. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=516.0s)]
*  Now he is politically less restrained. He is in his second term. He cannot run for another term, and he has a different set of advisors around him [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=523.0s)]
*  that are much more willing to go along with these policies. We saw a lot of pushback from his first-term advisors. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=531.0s)]
*  Let me just bring in a little bit of that, because in an interesting turn of events, the American billionaire Bill Ackman, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=537.0s)]
*  who endorsed President Trump last year, has posted himself saying that the US leader was losing the confidence of business leaders [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=543.0s)]
*  and should pause his trade war. He posted on it saying, the president has an opportunity to call a 90-day timeout, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=551.0s)]
*  and he warns, if we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=557.0s)]
*  Consumers will close their wallets and pocketbooks, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=563.0s)]
*  Simon, it's interesting, isn't it, to hear some of those who have spoken in favour of Trump now saying this? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=569.0s)]
*  Yes, and also Bill Ackman was very critical of Howard Lutnick, the economic secretary, saying that Howard Lutnick's firm was heavily invested [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=576.0s)]
*  in government bonds, which actually in a time like this do pretty well, because there's a run for safe haven. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=584.0s)]
*  But I think it's right. I had an interview with the vice chair of Goldman Sachs a few weeks ago, and that was when we were in this [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=589.0s)]
*  on-again-off-again terrorist thing with Mexico and Canada. He said that if you're a chief executive of a major company, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=596.0s)]
*  you don't know what to do right now. You don't know whether I'm not going to buy a company, I'm not going to open a factory, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=602.0s)]
*  I don't know where to do this, I don't know where to do that, because there's just so much flux. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=608.0s)]
*  And that is actually impacting business confidence, so they will invest less, they'll hire fewer people, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=611.0s)]
*  and that applies to the US as well as others. Now, there are some people around the world, for example, in the UK, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=617.0s)]
*  got the lowest, the low end of the tariffs, the bare 10% minimum. I've spoken to businesses who say, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=623.0s)]
*  I've been outcompeted trying to attract business in the US by Chinese and European counterparts. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=628.0s)]
*  Well, now my tariffs are half what they are in the EU, and they're a fifth of what China is being charged. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=634.0s)]
*  I'm back in the game. Maybe I can be competitive again. And let's not forget, there's lots of goods that were destined for the US, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=639.0s)]
*  which may now be redirected to other markets, including the UK, which has said it won't retaliate against the US. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=645.0s)]
*  So this is incredibly complicated. This is a finely tuned machine which has been tuned over decades, this kind of world trade thing. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=652.0s)]
*  And it's a bit like chucking a piano out of a top floor window. No one knows exactly what notes it's making, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=659.0s)]
*  and it's going to take a long time to pick through all the different categories of this. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=665.0s)]
*  But you're right in saying that everyone's looking for an opportunity for Trump to say, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=669.0s)]
*  oh, gosh, do you know what? The markets have freaked out a bit. Is there any room for negotiation? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=674.0s)]
*  So far, very little evidence of that, and that's why the markets are in such a bad mood. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=679.0s)]
*  Because people thought maybe things might change. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=683.0s)]
*  They thought Bach was worse than Beitz, and he doesn't really mean this. He's surely not going to sort of levy stuff on. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=686.0s)]
*  People have said to me, I went to the supermarket last night, I can't believe the trade deficit I have for the supermarket, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=691.0s)]
*  that they should be buying as much from me as I buy from them. So it doesn't really work like that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=698.0s)]
*  That's a silly example, perhaps, but that's what some countries are saying. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=702.0s)]
*  And let me just bring in a post from Donald Trump himself, Laura, to put to you. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=706.0s)]
*  He has posted in the last hour or so saying, oil prices are down, interest rates are down, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=710.0s)]
*  the slow-moving Fed should cut rates, he says. Food prices are down, there is no inflation, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=714.0s)]
*  and the long-time abuse at USA is bringing in billions of dollars a week from the abusing countries on tariffs that are already taking place. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=719.0s)]
*  He also talks about China saying, the biggest abuser of them all, China, as he puts it, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=725.0s)]
*  whose markets are crashing, just raised its tariffs by 34%. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=729.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of speculation, Laura, as to actually what the ultimate motive of Donald Trump is. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=734.0s)]
*  Is he trying to bring interest rates down? Is this about targeting China? Is he literally focused on the trade deficits? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=739.0s)]
*  What do you read into this latest post? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=747.0s)]
*  It's sort of an all-of-the-buff strategy, and if you ask the people around him, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=749.0s)]
*  there's certain people who are seizing on different parts of this. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=753.0s)]
*  Trump has put a lot of pressure on the Federal Reserve, the central bank, to lower interest rates. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=756.0s)]
*  This has really kind of cut across long-standing policy where presidents are not supposed to put pressure on Federal Reserve chairs [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=761.0s)]
*  on their interest rate-making policies. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=768.0s)]
*  Trump has essentially ignored that, but this is something he's wanted for a long time, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=771.0s)]
*  and he essentially said that the Federal Reserve is constraining the economy and constraining, therefore, his popularity by keeping rates too high. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=775.0s)]
*  He also has long-standing grievances with China, and so we see this tit-for-tat race here. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=783.0s)]
*  Of course, that first round of tariffs that he did allegedly about illegal immigration and fentanyl, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=788.0s)]
*  China had those 20 percent tariffs, then they got another 34 percent here last week. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=793.0s)]
*  But it's not clear that there's sort of an endgame here that's planned out. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=798.0s)]
*  Some of Trump's advisers want to have a lot of tariff revenue because they want to offset tax cuts, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=803.0s)]
*  but you kind of can't have all of these things. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=808.0s)]
*  You can't both have a negotiation and use the sort of threat of tariffs [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=810.0s)]
*  and then the possibility of lowering them to bring people to the table and also raise revenue. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=815.0s)]
*  And so this is what really has markets so freaked out, what has economists scratching their heads, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=819.0s)]
*  and has really sort of caused the chaos that we've seen over the past five days or so. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=823.0s)]
*  OK, we're going to get more on this in just a moment, but we're going to take a very quick break. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=827.0s)]
*  Laura, Simon, do stay with us. We've got a lot more questions coming in. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=830.0s)]
*  If you want to send them in, please do get in touch. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=834.0s)]
*  This is BBC News. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBX7X46pP0&t=836.0s)]
