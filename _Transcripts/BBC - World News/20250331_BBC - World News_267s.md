# US President Trump 'very angry' with Russia’s Putin over Ukraine ceasefire negotiations | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY)
*  President Trump has told the US broadcaster NBC that he's very angry with Russia's Vladimir Putin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=0.0s)]
*  for questioning the credibility of Ukraine's president. His comments mark a sharp change of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=6.24s)]
*  tone from his normal stance towards Moscow. Donald Trump told an NBC reporter the Russian [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=11.76s)]
*  president's comments about Volodymyr Zelenskyy were not going in the right direction. He threatened [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=17.84s)]
*  to impose secondary tariffs on Russian oil and said he planned to speak to Vladimir Putin [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=23.92s)]
*  in the coming week. President Trump also threatened Iran with bombings and secondary [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=29.2s)]
*  tariffs if it does not make a deal and continues to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=34.56s)]
*  Well let's discuss these latest developments with Peter Dickinson, editor of Ukraine Alert, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=40.08s)]
*  the Atlantic Council, joining us now live from Kyiv. Peter, good to talk to you again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=44.96s)]
*  So what is your take on this change in tone from the US president? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=50.72s)]
*  Good morning, Sally. Well, it certainly is a change in the rhetoric from Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=55.92s)]
*  It wasn't the harshest criticism he's ever issued. This is a man who refers to Canada as the 51st [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=62.56s)]
*  state, so he was still quite guarded in his comments. But nevertheless, it was definitely [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  a change down from his usual quite deferential tone towards Vladimir Putin. And I think it suggests [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=73.76s)]
*  he knows that his current strategy toward the peace process is not working and he's in danger [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=80.48s)]
*  of looking foolish. Trump approached this issue from the beginning by offering a lot of concessions [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  to the Russians, putting pressure on the Ukrainians. That got him to the point where three weeks ago, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=92.64s)]
*  Ukraine agreed to an unconditional ceasefire. But ever since, all we've seen from Putin really is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=99.36s)]
*  stalling tactics, playing for time and demands for additional conditions, further concessions. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=106.16s)]
*  And now, of course, the most recent comments from Putin on Friday, which he appeared to question [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=113.6s)]
*  the entire notion of having an agreement with Zelensky and questioning whether Zelensky was [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=119.44s)]
*  a legitimate president and whether he could do a deal with him and whether Ukraine should be placed [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  under some sort of a UN mandate. So I think Trump is aware that it looks like Putin is playing him [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=128.16s)]
*  and he needs to at least be seen to take a slightly tougher stance. Well, clearly he's done [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=135.2s)]
*  that with this interview where he said he's angry. He's made it very clear that his patience is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  running out when it comes to the Kremlin's response. So how do you expect Moscow to respond to this? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=146.56s)]
*  I think a lot will depend on this telephone call that the two leaders are expected to have [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=154.48s)]
*  later this week. That's going to be key. That's what Putin's strategy is all about. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=159.92s)]
*  Trump's strategy is all about building relationships at the top between himself [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  and Putin. So a lot will hinge on that conversation. I don't think at this stage [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  that the Russians will be particularly intimidated. They've heard this sort of talk from Trump before. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=173.2s)]
*  They know that Trump is desperate to get a deal, that he's very keen to push this forward one way [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=179.12s)]
*  or the other, and he's ready to pressure Ukraine rather than Russia itself. So I think they'll see [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=183.92s)]
*  it as an indication that the talks need to move forward in some sense. But they'll be [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  in no major hurry. Putin still feels pretty comfortable about where he's at at the moment [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=194.16s)]
*  in the war, where the negotiations are at, and the position he has in terms of the leverage, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=198.24s)]
*  the very limited leverage Trump currently has. But what about you say limited leverage, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=203.04s)]
*  but he's threatening secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian oil if Moscow doesn't do a deal soon. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Will that have an impact in terms of putting pressure on Russia or not? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=216.4s)]
*  It would have an impact if he goes ahead with that threat. Again, he was quite cautious in how [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=219.76s)]
*  he phrased that, saying if Russia doesn't make a deal, if I think Russia's to blame for that, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  if some buts. So I don't think they'll take it as an immediate threat. I think they'll see that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  there's still room to maneuver down the line. And if it came to that, then they could make some sort [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=237.44s)]
*  of concessions towards the Americans. I don't think it would be decisive and the impact wouldn't [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=242.0s)]
*  be immediate. So Russia will continue with its current strategy, I think, until they are convinced [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=248.08s)]
*  that the Americans are very serious about this and are prepared to impose very painful measures. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=253.84s)]
*  Okay. Peter, good to pick your brains again. Thank you for your time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=258.64s)]
*  Peter Dickinson there, editor of Ukraine Alert at Atlantic Council. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdgGcyWASY&t=262.16s)]
