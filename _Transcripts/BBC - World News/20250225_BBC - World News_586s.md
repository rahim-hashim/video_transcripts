Video Description: The US has twice sided with Russia in votes at the United Nations to mark the third anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, highlighting the Trump administration's change of stance on the war.

First the US opposed a European-drafted resolution which condemned Moscow's actions and supported Ukraine's territorial integrity - voting the same way as Russia and countries including North Korea and Belarus at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York.

Then the US drafted and voted for a resolution at the UN Security Council which called for an end to the conflict but contained no criticism of Russia.

The Security Council passed the resolution but two key US allies, the UK and France, abstained after their attempts to amend the wording were vetoed.

The UN resolutions were tabled as French President Emmanuel Macron visited President Donald Trump at the White House in an attempt to address their different stances over the war.

# US breaks with European allies and sides with Russia in UN resolutions on Ukraine | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88)
*  America's changing stance on the war in Ukraine has been highlighted at the United Nations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=0.0s)]
*  where its UN envoy voted twice alongside Russia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=5.32s)]
*  First, the two countries opposed a European drafted resolution condemning Moscow's actions [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=8.84s)]
*  and supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=14.48s)]
*  Then they backed a US resolution calling for an end to the conflict but containing no criticism [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=16.76s)]
*  of Russia. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=22.26s)]
*  It comes as the French President Emmanuel Macron says a truce between Ukraine and Russia [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=23.32s)]
*  could be agreed in the coming weeks following talks with President Trump in the White House [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=27.88s)]
*  amid straining US-Europe relations. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=32.04s)]
*  He is the first European leader to visit since Trump's inauguration ahead of the arrival [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=35.04s)]
*  of the UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, on Thursday. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=39.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, in France, two people have been arrested in relation to an arson attack on [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=42.64s)]
*  the Russian consulate in Marseille on Monday. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Prosecutors called the pair major individuals. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=50.8s)]
*  In Ukraine, air raid alerts have been sounded again today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=54.0s)]
*  Overnight, Poland deployed aircraft to secure its airspace after Russia launched strikes [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=57.76s)]
*  targeting western Ukraine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=63.24s)]
*  BBC's Joe Inwood reports. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=65.24s)]
*  In northern Ukraine, new troops are still being trained, even as the war enters its [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=69.24s)]
*  fourth year. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=73.8s)]
*  The cost has been huge, but this country appears to be holding on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=78.84s)]
*  It's done so through the effort of men like Evhen, who says Ukraine is making more of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=83.76s)]
*  its own weapons and will continue to do so. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=88.28s)]
*  It's good to get help from abroad. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=93.4s)]
*  Help won't last forever. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  It's here today. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  It might be gone tomorrow. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=98.56s)]
*  And that point has been brought home by the dramatic change in U.S. policy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  Once Ukraine's greatest ally, Donald Trump has started repeating Moscow lies about Kiev [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  starting the war. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=110.56s)]
*  And so yesterday's visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House had extra [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=113.54s)]
*  significance. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=118.34s)]
*  Again, the relationship has been very special with France and very special with this gentleman [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=119.34s)]
*  on my right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  They've always got on well, but there were points of disagreement. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=129.58s)]
*  They get their money back. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=131.9s)]
*  No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=132.9s)]
*  We paid 60 percent of the total effort. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=136.38s)]
*  It was through, like the U.S., loans, guarantee, grants. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=138.82s)]
*  And we provided real money, to be clear. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=143.34s)]
*  And that was not the only crack in the transatlantic alliance. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=146.42s)]
*  We need to reconfirm that the aggression should be condemned and discredited, not rewarded. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=150.18s)]
*  In an extraordinary development at the U.N., European countries in the U.S. found themselves [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=157.48s)]
*  resolutions on Ukraine, with America on the same side as Russia, Belarus and North Korea. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=163.82s)]
*  While in Kiev, Ukraine's remaining allies took part in events to commemorate three years [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=174.14s)]
*  of war and talks aimed at ensuring the sacrifices they've made will not have been in vain. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  Jo Inwood, BBC News. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=186.1s)]
*  Well, our Ukraine correspondent, James Waterhouse, gave more details about the reaction from [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  Kiev to the talks between Macron and Trump. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=193.46s)]
*  Well, we've had no specific reaction to a meeting between Emmanuel Macron and Donald [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=196.66s)]
*  Trump here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=202.9s)]
*  Instead, the focus has been on Ukraine's own rallying cry to its remaining allies, as America [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  throws the gauntlet down, really, challenges Europe to try and step up where it is less [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=211.94s)]
*  willing to do so. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=216.18s)]
*  We're going to see Sikir Starmer follow suit, where he will visit Donald Trump in the White [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  House to try and bridge a widening gap between Europe and America. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=222.5s)]
*  So here, instead, we have seen a continuation, really, of military pledges, an announcement [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  of new sanctions against Russia by the likes of the European Union. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=234.78s)]
*  And I think it's a departure from the alignment we're seeing, certainly, with the United [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=241.78s)]
*  Nations votes we've seen, with the softening of language from Washington. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=247.02s)]
*  Here, we are still seeing a country still at war and its European allies trying to adopt [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  a stronger stance as possible in the absence of America. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=257.74s)]
*  But what's reflected, I think, by Emmanuel Macron and Sikir Starmer going to Washington [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=261.1s)]
*  is the fact that they still need America for a military assurance if fighting was to break [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=266.02s)]
*  out after a ceasefire was agreed here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=273.02s)]
*  But for now, it seems that more of Ukraine's closer allies are more willing to put boots [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  on the ground, to send troops here, to enforce some kind of ceasefire. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=283.58s)]
*  At the moment, they're keen to stress it wouldn't be in a confrontational capacity, but there [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=287.54s)]
*  is no guarantee that fighting would not break out when you consider that Russia will continue, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  it looks like, to occupy a fifth of Ukraine, and that would involve a sizeable military [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=298.18s)]
*  presence. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=302.94s)]
*  James Waterhouse there will join me now as political commentator, author and journalist [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=304.94s)]
*  Christine O'Crenth. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  Thanks for being with us, Christine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=309.70000000000005s)]
*  It was fascinating to watch the public interactions yesterday with Macron and Trump. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  Just first of all, what did you make of the overall, the body language, the precise language [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  from what we saw? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=322.62s)]
*  Well, I think there was some effort on both sides to make it look, you know, fairly friendly, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=323.62s)]
*  no hostile confrontation. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=333.22s)]
*  But it is obvious that the transatlantic gap is widening, and there was that very interesting [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=336.02000000000004s)]
*  moment where Donald Trump, as usual, being carried away by his alternative facts, said, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=344.62s)]
*  oh, you know, you know, Europeans are getting their money back from Ukraine. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=351.94s)]
*  And then Macron very calmly put his hand on Trump's arm and said, well, no, actually, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  no, Europeans paid 60% of the aid provided to Ukraine and, you know, loans are the same [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=366.82s)]
*  as the U.S. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=375.22s)]
*  And that was the only moment where Trump was sort of slightly off balance, not that it [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=376.5s)]
*  mattered much, because obviously he kept on repeating that the old style American diplomacy [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=385.14s)]
*  is over and he wants to do things afresh again. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=392.58s)]
*  And as your correspondent pointed out, what is absolutely unbelievable is at the same [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=396.62s)]
*  time the U.S. voting at the General Assembly alongside with Russia, Iran and North Korea. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=403.62s)]
*  But there is, though, potentially a deal coming, according to Trump, and quite a shift if what [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=412.62s)]
*  he said yesterday is true, that Russia would accept EU peacekeepers, because that is not [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=420.62s)]
*  what Sergey Lavrov said at the Saudi meeting after the Saudi meeting with Marco Rubio. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=428.54s)]
*  If that is the case, if Russia does accept that and if Zelensky is going to travel to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=435.7s)]
*  the U.S. to sign a minerals deal in the next week or two, does it look likely that this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=441.02s)]
*  war will stop? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=448.7s)]
*  Well, there has been no commitment whatsoever on the American side yesterday. It's not a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=450.62s)]
*  that the U.S. would provide the indispensable backstop to a European force, which wouldn't [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=457.62s)]
*  be a military engaged force. It would be there to actually confirm that a ceasefire is being [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=467.82s)]
*  respected on both sides. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=479.62s)]
*  But if the U.S. has such a strong financial interest in these rare earth minerals, they [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=481.62s)]
*  will surely ensure the security of Ukraine? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=488.02s)]
*  Yes, but you know, the irony is that most of these rare earth lithium and so on are [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=491.62s)]
*  actually in the Donbass, in the area actually controlled, in the Ukrainian area controlled [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=501.86s)]
*  by Russian troops. And so that's why Putin said yesterday, oh, wonderful, if actually [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=509.38s)]
*  the U.S. pays for our exploiting those mineral resources. So you're right, that may be a [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=516.38s)]
*  point where Trump may think, well, if that's our investment, we might as well try and protect [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=524.02s)]
*  it. But it's so very illusional because these rare earths, all these haven't been really [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=530.46s)]
*  explored. The map is still very vague. And as we all know, these minerals are extremely [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=537.46s)]
*  difficult to extract. So let's not put the plow before the actual ceasefire agreement. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=546.38s)]
*  I mean, that's really what matters. And the problem is that Donald Trump is using Vladimir [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=556.46s)]
*  Putin's wording. It is again, absolutely, I can't even find the words. I think we're [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=564.14s)]
*  all absolutely flabbergasted by the U-turn of American foreign policy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=573.98s)]
*  Christine Ockrent, we will have to leave you there, but thank you so much for being with [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=582.3000000000001s)]
*  us. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJu1MXbL88&t=585.1s)]
