Video Description: Israel has carried out air strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs, saying it was targeting Hezbollah's drone production.
 
The attack on the eve of Eid Al Adha, one of the most important celebrations in Islam, followed evacuation warnings for several buildings in the area, where Hezbollah is based in the capital. 
 
The attack occurred despite a ceasefire being in effect between Israel and the armed group for the past six months and Lebanon's prime minister said he "strongly condemns" the strikes.
 
The strikes came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed Israel is arming clans in Gaza that he says are opposed to Hamas.

*  Israel has carried out airstrikes on Beirut. The attack followed an evacuation warning by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli military for several buildings in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=6.08s)]
*  The IDF claims the buildings were being used for drone production by the Iranian-backed group [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=11.52s)]
*  Hezbollah. There were chaotic scenes before the attack as large numbers of people tried to leave [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=16.32s)]
*  the area. The US-backed organization responsible for distributing aid within Gaza says that all [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=22.88s)]
*  distribution sites are closed. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has not said when they'll reopen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=29.44s)]
*  A correspondent in Jerusalem, Barbara Blett-Asher, told us a little more about this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  It has been working at renovating and repairing its sites, the group has said, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=40.96s)]
*  after there have been a number of mass casualty events around the area as people were queuing or [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  trying to get to those aid hubs, which we've been reporting having gone through these Israeli military [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=52.24s)]
*  zones and there having been gunfire that the eyewitnesses have accused Israeli troops. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=58.56s)]
*  The Israelis say they are still investigating but in the meantime the Foundation has closed its sites [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=66.08s)]
*  for this repair work. It opened yesterday afternoon, two of them, two of the four, and now it's saying [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=71.92s)]
*  again that none of them are going to be open for the time being and people should wait to hear for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  the next announcement of when they can come. Barbara, while we await that, there's also been [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=84.08s)]
*  a further development. Israel's Prime Minister confirming that the Israeli government is supplying [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=89.6s)]
*  weapons to a group in Gaza, a group that some see as a criminal gang that presents itself as an [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=95.52s)]
*  opposition force to Hamas. Just what more do we know about this development? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=102.64s)]
*  Yes, it's a bit of a political firestorm here in Israel. The opposition politicians have started to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=106.32s)]
*  accuse the Prime Minister of doing this, of arming the clans that are anti-Hamas in Gaza to be a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=116.32s)]
*  counterweight to Hamas, to try to weaken it. Eventually Mr Netanyahu responded to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=123.6s)]
*  he was angry about the leak but he was very, he defended the actual policy. He said no, this is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=131.28s)]
*  working. It means that our soldiers will be safer but the criticism that was coming from both the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=138.24s)]
*  left and right of the political spectrum was the opposite. No, this is actually making Israel much [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=143.28s)]
*  less secure because you are creating a ticking time bomb, another sort of opposition force, and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=148.32s)]
*  who knows where that's going to go. A lot of this is revolving around a militia led by a man named [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=154.08s)]
*  Yasser Abu Shabab who has a reputation for heading a gang, a notorious reputation for heading a gang [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  accused of stealing, looting humanitarian aid. Now he disputes this. He has also just recently denied [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  that the Israelis are arming him but I think he is not going to convince very many Gazans about that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzz0eAeqeHI&t=176.24s)]
