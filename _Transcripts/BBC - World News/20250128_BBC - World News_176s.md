Video Description: Fierce fighting is taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo between rebels and government forces.

Gunmen of the March 23 Movement, known as the M23 rebels, are in control of large parts of the city of Goma after a rapid advance in recent days.  Many thousands of people have been fleeing the fighting. 

The government has accused neighbouring Rwanda of declaring war by sending its troops over the border to support the rebels.  
Rwanda does not deny backing the M23 group but it in turn accuses the Congolese authorities of supporting militias trying to topple its government.

The rebels have gained control of vast parts of mineral-rich eastern DR Congo since 2021. In the past few weeks, the group has been advancing swiftly in the east of the country.   More than 400,000 people have been forced from their homes in the provinces of North and South Kivu in the past month, according to the UNâ€™s refugee agency.
