Video Description: The United Nations' children's agency has warned of devastating consequences of Israel's aid blockade of Gaza, with hundreds of supply trucks now stuck in Egypt.
 
Regional mediators are said to be trying to resolve the standoff. Hamas has said the agreed second phase of the ceasefire deal must begin, leading to an end to the conflict.
 
But Israel has offered only a temporary extension to the first phase which expired on Saturday - with more hostage exchanges, and no talks.
 
An Israeli government spokesman called on Hamas to accept the plan and accused it of stealing aid sent into Gaza and using it to fund its activities.

# Israel stops all humanitarian aid entering Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg)
*  Let's focus on another incident which has taken place today in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=0.0s)]
*  There's growing concern of course about the security situation in Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=6.0s)]
*  In fact one person killed and several injured in the port city of Haifa today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=11.0s)]
*  And that comes at a time of course when there is concern over the ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=15.0s)]
*  Israel has blocked fuel and food from entering the Strip this morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=20.0s)]
*  These are the most recent pictures of the crossings which have all been closed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=25.0s)]
*  And in place of phase two negotiations the Israelis are now proposing a six week extension of phase one which Hamas has already rejected. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=29.0s)]
*  After a security cabinet meeting last night Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said half the living hostages should be returned on the first day of that extension. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=38.0s)]
*  And if negotiations are not being conducted in good faith he said we will return to fighting in Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=46.0s)]
*  The UN and several Arab countries have condemned the decision this morning and have accused Israel of breaking international law. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=52.0s)]
*  Lucy Williamson reports. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=59.0s)]
*  Hamas said it was a violation of the deal they'd agreed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=82.0s)]
*  There will be no free lunches. If Hamas thinks that it will be possible to continue the ceasefire without us accepting hostages it is very mistaken. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=86.0s)]
*  Aid has been flowing into Gaza over the past six weeks. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=97.0s)]
*  Many Gazans now less worried about Israel's willingness to stop the trucks than its reluctance to stop the war. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=101.0s)]
*  The people are worried that the war might return and that we will go back to the source of war. Expensive prices and death. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=110.0s)]
*  Everyone was hurt by this war. Their houses destroyed and people are now begging in the streets. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=118.0s)]
*  So we tell Hamas to hand over the hostages so Israel gives us back our children from the Israeli prisons. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=124.0s)]
*  In Israel the return of hostages like Sagi Dekel-Hen has increased pressure to extend the deal and get others home. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=132.0s)]
*  Among them 14 others from Sagi's kibbutz near Oz. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=141.0s)]
*  Israeli military leadership and our intelligence community has been saying that any incremental gains militarily in Gaza are not worth the lives of the hostages. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=145.0s)]
*  The hostages must come home and of course that does mean at some level an ongoing ceasefire. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=156.0s)]
*  But Israel is signalling it's still ready for war. Sending more tanks to Gaza's border and calling up reserves. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=163.0s)]
*  Hamas says the price of freeing more hostages is ending the war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=170.0s)]
*  Some in Israel hope the threat of continuing it might also work. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pyMRwyllg&t=175.0s)]
