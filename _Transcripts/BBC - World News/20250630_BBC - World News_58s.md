# Staged protest against US President Donald Trump at Paris Fashion Week. #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA)
*  This Paris Fashion Week show just staged a powerful protest against US President Donald Trump's immigration policy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=0.0s)]
*  Designer Willy Chavarria had his models with shaved heads wearing all white, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=4.48s)]
*  walking in a single fire with their hands tied behind their backs before being forced to kneel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  The images were eerily reminiscent of the pictures coming out of El Salvador's high security CICOT prison, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=10.72s)]
*  the prison at the center of Trump's immigration policy, which is notorious for its poor human rights record. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  This month, the president called on federal agencies to enforce the largest mass deportation program in history. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=19.2s)]
*  And right now, there's fresh fear. Surprise deportations and crackdowns on immigrant communities are escalating again. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=23.76s)]
*  Chavarria, who's Mexican-American, used the fashion show as an opportunity to protest the president's policies. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=28.72s)]
*  The stunt was met with mixed response. Some fans loved it, others not so much. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=33.04s)]
*  And it's not the first time that the designer has used his newly established space on the fashion circuit to spread a political message. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=36.4s)]
*  At his debut Paris Fashion Week show last summer, he incorporated quotes from a pro-LGBTQ rights bishop who went head-to-head with Trump, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=41.36s)]
*  as well as clips from Emilia Perez, which stars a trans actress as the lead. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=47.44s)]
*  Paris Fashion Week is always a magnet for celebrities. Brianna, ASAP Rocky, Sabrina Carpenter. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=51.04s)]
*  But this year, Chavarria used that spotlight to make a difference. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBeAPDOkWQA&t=55.519999999999996s)]
