# Corbyn: PM 'playing chicken with people's livelihoods' - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A)
*  Thank you very much Mr Speaker. I usually thank the Prime Minister for an advanced copy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=0.0s)]
*  of her statement but it was handed to me just as I was leaving my office to come down here [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=8.48s)]
*  so I can only assume she entrusted it to the Transport Secretary to deliver it to me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=13.94s)]
*  Mr Speaker, our country is facing the biggest crisis in a generation and yet the Prime Minister [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=18.4s)]
*  continues to recklessly run down the clock. We were promised there would be a deal last [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=38.68s)]
*  October, it didn't happen. We were promised a meaningful vote on a deal in December, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=44.24s)]
*  it didn't happen. We were told to prepare for a further meaningful vote this week after [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=49.800000000000004s)]
*  the Prime Minister again promised to secure significant and legally binding changes to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=55.0s)]
*  the backstop and that hasn't happened. Now the Prime Minister comes before the House [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=60.08s)]
*  with more excuses and more delays. In her statement the Prime Minister has failed to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=65.4s)]
*  answer even the most basic questions. What progress has she made on identifying and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=70.62s)]
*  working up the alternative arrangements? Have they been presented to the European Union? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  If not, when will they be presented? And will she set them out before this House and ask [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=84.12s)]
*  for its approval of them? In truth Mr Speaker, it appears the Prime Minister has just one [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=91.34s)]
*  tactic, to run down the clock hoping members of this House are blackmailed into supporting [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=98.0s)]
*  a deeply flawed deal. This Mr Speaker is an irresponsible act. She's playing for time [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=104.2s)]
*  and playing with people's jobs, our economic security and the future of our industries. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday growth figures show the lowest growth since 2012, our manufacturing sector mired [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=118.9s)]
*  into recession. The decision by Nissan last week to pull its investment from the Sunderland [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=126.12s)]
*  plant may only be the thin end of a very long wedge. Uncertainty and failing confidence [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=132.12s)]
*  in this Government to deliver are putting jobs at risk. The Prime Minister, the Chancellor [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=140.16s)]
*  and the Business Secretary will be hearing the same warnings as I am, that several major [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  manufacturers, household names employing tens of thousands of people, are poised to follow [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=153.84s)]
*  in Nissan's footsteps. Earlier today we heard from the Leader of the House that the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=160.3s)]
*  next meaningful vote may not happen until after the EU summit on 21 March, just days [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=166.46s)]
*  before Brexit is due to happen. If this is not the case, can the Prime Minister tell [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=175.46s)]
*  the House today when the meaningful vote will be? We also learned from the Leader of the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=182.36s)]
*  House that any changes to the backstop will not be written into the legally binding withdrawal [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=193.36s)]
*  agreement. Can the Prime Minister confirm that? Is the Prime Minister really prepared [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=199.16s)]
*  to risk people's livelihoods, jobs and investment in a desperate attempt to push a deeply flawed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=206.48s)]
*  deal through Parliament? The Prime Minister has just told Members of this House to hold [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=213.48s)]
*  their nerve. Tell that to Nissan workers in Sunderland and the thousands more worried [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=219.56s)]
*  about their job security and the future of their communities. No Minister serious about [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=225.76s)]
*  protecting jobs in this country would allow a Prime Minister to deliberately run down [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=234.28s)]
*  the clock and play chicken with people's livelihoods. To stand by and do nothing would [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=240.08s)]
*  be a complete dereliction of duty. As I received the Prime Minister's letter yesterday in [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=246.56s)]
*  response to Labour's Brexit plan, it became clearer to me that the Prime Minister is merely [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=254.06s)]
*  engaged in the pretense of working across Parliament to find solutions. She has not [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=259.92s)]
*  indicated that she will move one iota away from her rejected deal or any of her red lines. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=265.2s)]
*  On the backstop, the Prime Minister has pointed out, Labour also has concerns. Let us make [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=273.92s)]
*  no mistake about it, that has never been a major issue with the Prime Minister's deal. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=279.18s)]
*  In order to stop the UK falling into the backstop, we need a permanent customs union, a permanent [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=285.48s)]
*  customs union and a strong single market deal. That is the key to maintaining an open border [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  on the island of Ireland. That is key to protecting jobs, industry and living standards in this [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=301.32s)]
*  country. That is why it is backed by businesses who employ and trade unions who represent [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=308.08s)]
*  millions of workers in this country. To correct the Prime Minister's claim in her statement, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  we want to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union, as I set out in my letter. The Prime Minister [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  says there is no need to negotiate a customs union as her deal provides for the benefit [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=328.29999999999995s)]
*  of being in one. I am afraid that that is simply not the case. The deal the Prime Minister [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=334.08s)]
*  negotiated means there will be barriers to trade in goods. There will not be frictionless [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  trade putting manufacturers across the country at a huge disadvantage. This is made quite [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=347.36s)]
*  clear in the political declaration, especially when it says, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=353.96s)]
*  quote, the parties will form separate markets and distinct legal orders, and concedes that, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=357.96s)]
*  and I quote, can lead to a spectrum of different outcomes for administrative processes as well [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  as checks and controls. Nothing is secured. The Prime Minister is also trying to win support [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  for her deal by promising to protect workers' rights after Brexit. Well, Mr Speaker, just [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=378.24s)]
*  look at the record of the party opposite. They attacked trade union rights through the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=386.08s)]
*  Trade Union Act. They kept this House up all night, opposing the minimum wage in 1997. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=391.56s)]
*  They are the party that introduced employment tribunal fees and introduced the public sector [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  pay cap. For many of them, ripping up rights is what Brexit is all about. Take the Secretary [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=410.56s)]
*  of State for International Trade. He once wrote, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  It's too difficult to hire and fire, too expensive to take on new employees. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=423.2s)]
*  And went on to say, It is intellectually unsustainable to believe that workplace rights should remain [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=429.92s)]
*  untouchable. That was the Secretary of State for Trade. No wonder trade union leaders like [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=437.48s)]
*  Tim Roach of the GMB, and the Secretary of State for International Trade, Frans O'Grady, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=444.88s)]
*  have rejected the Prime Minister's inadequate pledges. It is vital, too, that we keep pace [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=449.56s)]
*  with the best consumer safeguards and environmental protections, as if the warnings of the destruction [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=457.68s)]
*  of our diverse, our biodiverse natural life are not serious enough. We have to be very [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  serious about all environmental protections and, indeed, make them much stronger. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  There is a sensible way forward, but the Prime Minister is refusing to listen. Labour's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  alternative has been widely welcomed as a way of breaking the impasse, from business [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=483.88s)]
*  leaders, European leaders and even from some Conservative MPs. But the Prime Minister refuses [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=492.2s)]
*  to listen. I urge all Members across this House to think about the damage the Prime [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=500.68s)]
*  Minister's strategy is doing. The threat to industry and skilled jobs and communities [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=507.88s)]
*  all across this country. Now is not the time to stand idly by. Now is the time to stand [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=515.52s)]
*  up and do the right thing, to rule out no deal and back Labour's alternative plan. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=524.6s)]
*  First of all, the right hon. Gentleman mentioned the announcement that has been made by Nissan. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=532.48s)]
*  I think for this House it is important to recognise that Nissan has confirmed that none [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=543.48s)]
*  of the current 7,000 jobs at the plant will be lost. They remain committed to the UK and, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=548.88s)]
*  indeed, they will be making more capital and will be invested in Sunderland, which was [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=555.28s)]
*  originally planned in 2016. The right hon. Gentleman asked me about progress on alternative [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=560.28s)]
*  arrangements and asked whether these were going to be put before the European Commission. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=566.36s)]
*  I remind him what I said in my statement, which was, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=571.56s)]
*  Yesterday my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union met [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=574.5999999999999s)]
*  with Michel Barnier to discuss the ideas put forward by the alternative arrangements working [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=578.8399999999999s)]
*  group comprised of a number of my hon. and right hon. Friends. I think that answers his [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=583.68s)]
*  question. He talked about Labour's proposal. I reference the issue of the customs union [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=588.3599999999999s)]
*  in my statement. But of course he also talks about being a member of the single market. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=594.8599999999999s)]
*  Being a member of the single market means accepting free movement. One of the things [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=599.76s)]
*  that people voted for when they voted to leave the European Union was to bring an end to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=606.96s)]
*  free movement, and that is what this Government will deliver. He asked about dates for the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=613.04s)]
*  process for votes that are going to take place in this House. I set those out in my statement [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=618.68s)]
*  as well. He referenced businesses quite a lot. Of course, businesses backed the deal. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=624.1s)]
*  They did. He talked about uncertainty. Of course, the best way to end uncertainty is [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=631.1s)]
*  to vote for a deal. He talked about running down the clock. No, I wanted to have this [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=643.36s)]
*  sorted before Christmas. I bought a deal back from the House on Christmas. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=653.5s)]
*  Mr Matheson, I have nurtured for a long time an ambition to see you become a statesman. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=668.04s)]
*  I think you are threatening that prospect by these noisy gesticulations. Calm Buddha-like. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=676.0s)]
*  The Prime Minister. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=683.46s)]
*  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The deal was negotiated before Christmas, so I wasn't in—it's [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=684.46s)]
*  not me who's trying to run down the clock. It's no good Labour Members who voted against [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=691.46s)]
*  the deal pointing their fingers across the House. Every time somebody votes against a [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=697.62s)]
*  deal, the risk of no deal increases. The right hon. Gentleman talked about acting in the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=705.58s)]
*  national interest. Yes, we should be acting in the national interest, and the national [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=712.6s)]
*  interest is in getting a deal agreed through this Parliament. That is why we are working [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=716.48s)]
*  with the European Union in everything that we are doing. The right hon. Gentleman made [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=722.9200000000001s)]
*  several references in his response to the issues of businesses and the issue of jobs [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=727.6s)]
*  and of protecting jobs. The deal we negotiated with the European Union—we are going back [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=734.14s)]
*  to deal with this issue of the backstop—the deal we have negotiated, the political declaration [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=739.18s)]
*  that sets out the future, is a deal that protects jobs. The one thing that we know would threaten [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=743.58s)]
*  jobs in this country would be a Labour Government. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna6VRMhF1A&t=749.34s)]
