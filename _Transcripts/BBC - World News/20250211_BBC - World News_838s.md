Video Description: US President Donald Trump has met King Abdullah of Jordan at the White House.

Speaking about the current Gaza ceasefire situation, Trump said he did not believe Hamas will meet the Saturday deadline to return Israeli hostages.
 
"I have a Saturday deadline, and I don't think they're going to make the deadline personally," the president says, adding: "I think they want to play tough guy, but we'll see how tough they are".
 
Earlier, Trump said "hell" would breakout if Hamas did not return all hostages by 12pm on Saturday.
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Gaza ceasefire will end if Hamas does not release Israeli hostages on Saturday.
 
Hamas said on Monday it would not release three Israelis as planned this weekend, because of alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire.

# Trump says he believes Hamas won't make Saturday hostage return deadline | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g)
*  On the two crucial areas, the US president has been repeating what he's said in recent days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=0.0s)]
*  And those two areas are the hostages and his plan for Gaza. So in terms of that plan for Gaza, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=7.12s)]
*  he's again repeated at length and in detail some of his thinking. He's talking about portions of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=13.76s)]
*  land, he says, inside Jordan, inside Egypt, that Palestinians would actually live in. He says [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=19.84s)]
*  they'd live safely but not inside Gaza. So he's doubled down on that. And in terms of the hostages, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=26.8s)]
*  we played you those comments yesterday where he said to reporters that he thinks that all [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  of the hostages needed to be released by Saturday lunchtime, demanding that and saying if he was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Israel and that didn't happen, he would cancel the ceasefire and all hell would break loose. Well, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=47.36s)]
*  he's repeated exactly that. He said all bets would be off if that was what happens on Saturday [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=54.48s)]
*  and the hostages weren't released. So we are at a point of real precariousness when it comes to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  the ceasefire and the hostage deal because we are still only in phase one of the hostage deal. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=69.92s)]
*  These pictures from what about an hour ago when King Abdullah arrived there at the White House. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=77.28s)]
*  He's the first Arab leader to meet with Donald Trump. Traditionally that has happened before [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=83.52s)]
*  but of course this time he arrives at the White House in what is a very tricky position because [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=90.32s)]
*  America, of course, an ally of Jordan but this time President Trump is talking about Jordan [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  needing to take part in his plan. Jordan, of course, has already said they don't want to do that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=104.0s)]
*  Egypt have repeated the same, much of the Middle East exactly chiming in with exactly that. Well, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=110.08s)]
*  the video has started so let's bring up the sound and let you hear some of the questions and answers. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=117.28s)]
*  Thank you very much. It's an honor to have King Abdullah with us. He's been a friend of mine for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=124.56s)]
*  a long time actually, long before even my first term and we've had a great relationship. He's a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=129.36s)]
*  great gentleman, a great leader and does a fantastic job in his country. His son, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=136.4s)]
*  we're lucky enough to have his handsome son with us today so it's good to see you again. We've had [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=142.88s)]
*  some quick discussions just now and we're going to have some longer discussions after this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=150.24s)]
*  and the relationship with Jordan has been very strong, has been with me and I really has been [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  with the country but I think I've been closer than other presidents to Jordan and what Jordan [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=161.44s)]
*  represents and it's an honor to have you and your son with us today and if you'd like to say a few [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=167.2s)]
*  words and thank you very much. Mr. President, thank you very much for having us and so short [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=173.68s)]
*  after your inauguration I think just as a testament to what you said is a special [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=178.16s)]
*  relationship between our two countries and the personal relationship of friendship and trust [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=182.4s)]
*  between the two of us. Mr. President, I truly believe that with all the challenges that we have [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=187.6s)]
*  in the Middle East that I finally see somebody that can take us across the finish line to bring [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  stability, peace and prosperity to all of us in the region and it is I think our collective [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=198.0s)]
*  responsibility in the Middle East to continue to work with you, to support you, to achieve those [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=203.68s)]
*  lofty goals so I'm very delighted to be here and as you said sir we've got some very interesting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  discussions. Very good, very good, thank you very much. Mr. President, many people in the region, especially [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=212.72s)]
*  Jordan, are worried about the annexation of the West Bank. Will you give His Majesty the King [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=219.04s)]
*  guarantee that you won't allow Israel to annex the West Bank? I think that's going to work out [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=223.84s)]
*  very well, that's not really what we're talking about today. I think that's something that's going [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=229.44s)]
*  to work out automatically and it's in good shape and we discuss it, other people have discussed it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=233.6s)]
*  with us and with me and that's going to work out, West Bank is going to work out very well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=241.04s)]
*  Mr. President, why should the King take in the Palestinian people? He's made clear he doesn't want to. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=245.44s)]
*  Well I don't know but he may have just something to say because we discussed just briefly, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=249.68s)]
*  I think maybe you want to say it now or? Well Mr. President, I think we have to keep in mind that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=255.6s)]
*  there is a plan from Egypt and the Arab countries, we're being invited by Mohammed bin Salman to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=262.56s)]
*  discussions in Riyadh. I think the point is how to make this work in a way that is [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=267.84s)]
*  good for everybody and obviously we have to look at the best interests of the United States, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=272.88s)]
*  of the people in the region, especially to my people of Jordan and we're going to have some [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=278.32s)]
*  interesting discussions today. I think one of the things that we can do right away is take 2,000 [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=282.32s)]
*  children that are either cancer children or in a very ill state to Jordan as quickly as possible [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  and then wait for I think the Egyptians to present their plan on how we can work with the President [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=296.16s)]
*  to work on the Gaza challenges. Excuse me, please. I didn't know that what you just said, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  2,000 children with cancer or other problems and that's really a beautiful gesture, that's really [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=310.8s)]
*  good and we appreciate it and we'll be working on the rest with Egypt. I think you're going to see [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=318.8s)]
*  some great progress. I think with Jordan you're going to see some great progress. Three of us [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=325.92s)]
*  are going to have some others helping and we're going to have some others at a very high level [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  helping and the whole thing will come. It's not a complex thing to do and with the United States [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  being in control of that piece of land, a fairly large piece of land, you're going to have stability [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=339.92s)]
*  in the Middle East for the first time and the Palestinians or the people that live now in Gaza [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=345.68s)]
*  will be living beautifully in another location. They're going to be living safely. They're not [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=352.56s)]
*  going to be killed, murdered and having to leave every 10 years because I've been watching this [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=356.56s)]
*  for so many years. It's nothing but trouble. Everyone's being killed, they're being robbed. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=362.08s)]
*  It's like living in hell and they're going to end up having a great home, great families that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  don't have to get mugged and killed and beaten up and harassed by Hamas and everybody else. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=376.16s)]
*  I know we'll be able to work something and what you just said about the 2,000 is fantastic. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=383.92s)]
*  It's so beautiful. It's music to my ears but we're going to be able to work something and I know [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=390.16s)]
*  we'll be able to work something also with I believe not 100% but 99% we're going to work [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=395.28s)]
*  out something with Egypt. Mr. President, how is the U.S. going to own Gaza? Your White House has [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=403.76s)]
*  made clear taxpayer dollars won't be used for this. What money are you going to use to buy Gaza? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=412.32s)]
*  We're not going to buy anything. We're going to have it and we're going to keep it and we're [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=417.84s)]
*  going to make sure that there's going to be peace and there's not going to be any problem and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=420.96s)]
*  nobody's going to question it and we're going to run it very properly and eventually we'll have [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=425.2s)]
*  economic development at a very large scale, maybe the largest scale on that site [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  and we'll have lots of good things built there including hotels and office buildings and housing [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  and other things and we'll make that site into what it should be and the people from Gaza who [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=442.24s)]
*  wouldn't be able to be there for years because you're talking about just to get it and prepare [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=447.68s)]
*  it and to take care of all of the problems that currently it has as you know tunnels and people [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=452.64s)]
*  are in those tunnels and you have some good people and some bad people and you may have [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  hostages right now you know you have the hostages possibly there they don't know where they are [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=464.32s)]
*  and you know I have a Saturday deadline and I don't think they're going to make the deadline [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=469.68s)]
*  personally I think they they want to play tough guy but we'll see how tough they are but it's [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=474.24s)]
*  it's going to be a wonderful thing it's going to be wonderful for the Middle East I think it'll [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=481.20000000000005s)]
*  turn the Middle East I think you're going to have peace in the Middle East you're going to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=484.48s)]
*  eventually have peace in the Middle East. Couldn't this deadline risk undermining the talks that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=487.6s)]
*  you're having with the King today and risk the kind of wider piece that you're trying to? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=494.8s)]
*  Because that's not we're not talking about a big situation we're talking about something that can [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=500.0s)]
*  go very quickly we're talking about it's going to go quickly it's not going to take a long time [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=504.24s)]
*  okay that's not going to take a long time. You know bullies you know the bully is right you know [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=508.96s)]
*  the the bully I've always and I found it throughout my life a bully is the weakest person [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=514.24s)]
*  and they're bullies Hamas is bullies the weakest people are bullies you know that right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=520.16s)]
*  All right go ahead. Mr. President you were saying that Palestinians will live somewhere else safe [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  where exactly do you want them to live? Well it's not where I want them to live it's going to be [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=531.76s)]
*  where we ultimately choose as a group and I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt we may have some place else but I think when we [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  finish our talks we'll have a place where they're going to live very happily and very safely and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=549.76s)]
*  you know don't forget they only want to be on the Gaza Strip because they don't know anything else [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=556.08s)]
*  they never had an alternative and they don't want to be on the Gaza Strip but they have no choice [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=561.68s)]
*  they have to be and they're being killed there at levels that nobody's ever seen no no place in the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=566.8s)]
*  world is like as as dangerous as the Gaza Strip they don't want to be there they have no alternative [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=571.84s)]
*  when they have an alternative not one person will want to stay where they are nobody wants to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=577.28s)]
*  stay there they're living in hell it's a it's a death trap. Mr. President how do you know that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=582.4s)]
*  the Palestinians don't want to leave their land some people say this is ethnic cleansing you won't [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=588.4s)]
*  be able to force them to leave their land. We're moving into a beautiful location where they have [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=593.6s)]
*  new homes where they can live safely where they'll have doctors and medical and all of those things [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  and I think it's going to be great yeah any questions? King Abdullah what do you think about [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=606.4s)]
*  the U.S. taking over the Gaza Strip do you want to see the U.S. own the Gaza Strip? Well I think as I [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=610.16s)]
*  said earlier the president is looking at Egypt coming to present their plan as I said we will [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=615.36s)]
*  be in Saudi Arabia to discuss how we can work with the president and with the United States [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=621.84s)]
*  so I think let's wait until the Egyptians can come and present to the president and not get [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  ahead of ourselves. And is there a partial land in Jordan that you're willing to have Palestinians? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=632.16s)]
*  Well I think what we said I have to look at the best interests of my country I think the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=635.52s)]

*  fall down and they're living under people are being killed every day the conditions are horrible [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=714.96s)]
*  there are no conditions anywhere in the world that are worse than the Gaza Strip right now. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQG9fSfc0g&t=720.48s)]
