Video Description: Cardinals will meet next month in a secret conclave to elect the next pope, the Vatican has said.
The closed-door meeting will start inside the Sistine Chapel on 7 May and will involve some 135 cardinals from across the world.
It follows the death of Pope Francis who died at the age of 88 on Easter Monday and whose funeral was held on Saturday.
There is no timescale as to how long it will take to elect the next pope, but the previous two conclaves, held in 2005 and 2013, lasted just two days.

**BBC - World News:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA)
*  The conclave to elect a new pope will begin next week on the 7th of May. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=0.0s)]
*  There's one round of voting on the first afternoon of conclave and 135 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=5.0s)]
*  cardinals will vote up to four times every day until a two-thirds majority [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=10.0s)]
*  is reached. Our religion editor, Alim McBull, is in Vatican City and, Alim, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=14.0s)]
*  this starts on the 7th of May but impossible to predict how and when it will end. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=19.0s)]
*  We had the spectacular, many junctures, very moving funeral of Pope Francis [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=24.0s)]
*  on Saturday. That started nine official days of mourning. The conclave could [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=29.0s)]
*  have started at any point after the conclusion of that period of mourning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=34.0s)]
*  It could have started as early as next Monday. This morning, around 180 of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=39.0s)]
*  the full contingent of cardinals got together at a meeting and decided it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=44.0s)]
*  would start next Wednesday. They haven't given a reason as to why it starts [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=49.0s)]
*  on Wednesday but there are some cardinals who are not here, there are some who [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=54.0s)]
*  are in ill health, there are some who are travelling long distances so they may [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=59.0s)]
*  have been factors. But from next Wednesday, those cardinals who are [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=64.0s)]
*  eligible, so the ones under 80, 135 of them, will be locked away essentially in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=69.0s)]
*  Sistine Chapel, out of contact with the outside world until they come up, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=75.0s)]
*  two thirds of them plus one, come up with the person they want, they coalesce [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=80.0s)]
*  around the man they want to lead the world's estimated 1.4 billion Catholics. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=85.0s)]
*  Alim of Vatican City, thank you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3OsMPtw6tA&t=90.0s)]
