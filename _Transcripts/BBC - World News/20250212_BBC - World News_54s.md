# Elon Musk denies "hostile takeover" of US government. #ElonMusk #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs)
*  Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=0.0s)]
*  So nobody's going to bat a thousand. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=3.64s)]
*  I mean, we will make mistakes, but we'll act quickly to correct any mistake. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=5.84s)]
*  Say that you're orchestrating a hostile takeover of government [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=10.24s)]
*  and doing it in a non-transparent way. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=14.52s)]
*  Well, first of all, you couldn't ask for a stronger mandate from the public. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=16.68s)]
*  The people voted for major government reform, and that's what people are going to get. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=22.04s)]
*  All of our actions are fully public. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=25.92s)]
*  So if you see anything, you say, like, wait a second, hey, that seems like maybe that's, you know, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  there's a conflict there. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  It's not like people are going to be shy about saying that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=36.64s)]
*  They'll say it immediately. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=38.76s)]
*  Transparency is what builds trust. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=40.04s)]
*  Not simply somebody asserting trust. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  So not somebody saying they're trustworthy, but transparency. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=44.2s)]
*  So you can see everything that's going on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=47.12s)]
*  And then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=49.0s)]
*  It's totally obvious. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGSbJ1rhLs&t=52.68s)]
