# Elon Musk defends US government cost-cutting plans | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ)
*  Well more now on the news that US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  for the specially appointed Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=4.64s)]
*  to downsize the federal workforce. Now the President claims that there's been bribery and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=10.24s)]
*  fraud involving billions of dollars in government spending and the tech billionaire Elon Musk [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=16.16s)]
*  joined the President at the Oval Office as he signed that executive order. Mr Musk said that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=21.76s)]
*  the Department has been transparent with its handling of federal agencies. Well we can talk [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=26.96s)]
*  now to BBC Verify's Jake Horton. Jake this has been hugely controversial in the United States, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=33.92s)]
*  just talk us through the issues. So in the Oval Office last night alongside President Trump, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=39.04s)]
*  Elon Musk made a series of claims. One of these was about US foreign aid and in particular condoms [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=44.16s)]
*  being sent to Gaza. This is what he said. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=49.36s)]
*  So after that clip, Elon Musk took to X, his own platform, and doubled down saying 50 million [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=79.36s)]
*  dollars of condoms is a lot of condoms. But there's no evidence that condoms were sent in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  recent years to either Gaza in the Middle East or Gaza in Mozambique. That's a province in Mozambique, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=100.8s)]
*  the African country. There have been aid programs by the US in both of those places, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=106.64s)]
*  but we spoke to the agencies involved in both of those programs. They both told us that no money [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=112.24s)]
*  given to them was used to procure or distribute condoms in either the Middle East, in Gaza, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=117.44s)]
*  or in the province of Gaza in Mozambique. And they said they were also not aware of any future [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  commitments to do so. So like I said, there's no evidence of that. The initial claim, which the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=128.24s)]
*  reporter there alluded to, was made by the White House and President Trump about a week ago. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=133.12s)]
*  They initially said they stopped 50 million dollars of condoms being sent to Gaza. People [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=138.24s)]
*  were quick to point out that perhaps they got confused with Gaza in Mozambique because on a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=143.28s)]
*  government website there was a commitment to send about 80 million dollars to that province. But that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  program was for HIV prevention and not for condoms, the aid agency told us. In the past, the US has [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=154.24s)]
*  sent money abroad for contraceptive programs such as family planning. In 2023, which is the latest [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=162.16s)]
*  year we have data for, that amounted to 60 million dollars for the entire world and none of that was [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=169.44s)]
*  sent to Gaza in the Middle East. Most of that went to Africa. About 7 million of that was for condoms. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=174.24s)]
*  So that has happened in the past, but it's important to say that also happened under President Trump's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=179.84s)]
*  last administration. In 2019, when he was in office, that was about 40 million dollars for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=183.44s)]
*  contraceptives sent by the US around the world. Musk made a series of other claims. One of these [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=187.6s)]
*  was about social security, which is a program in the US which covers about 67 million people who [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  are retired or have a disability so they can't work and they get a basic income as a result. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=199.2s)]
*  This is what he said in particular about that program. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=204.56s)]
*  You know there's crazy things like just cross-re-examination of social security [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=208.0s)]
*  and we've got people in there that are 150 years old. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=212.64s)]
*  Now again there's no evidence for the specific claim Musk is making there about people being [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=216.16s)]
*  150 years old being on the roles of social security and we looked for such evidence and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  we haven't been able to find any yet. We're still looking and we'll report if we find any. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=226.88s)]
*  There is evidence, there's a report saying that there are about 19 million, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=231.04s)]
*  one nine million people on social security files in the US who are about 100 years old or older. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=235.92s)]
*  Now it's important to say these are people you might expect to be on the roles because [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=244.16s)]
*  it's a program that covers retired individuals and they also noted although there is 90 million [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=247.28s)]
*  people on the file only about 44,000 people on that file are actively getting benefits from [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  social security and there's about 100,000 people in the US according to latest census data that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=258.64s)]
*  are over 100 years old. So context is important here like I said at the top there's no evidence [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=263.84s)]
*  for the claim Musk makes about 150 year olds. In terms of 100 year olds there are some on the roles [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=269.2s)]
*  but the vast majority aren't gaining benefits and you would perhaps expect some of these people [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=274.88s)]
*  in the US to be gaining benefits off that program which covers retired individuals. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=279.2s)]
*  All right Jake thank you very much indeed. Jake Alton there from BBC Verify and we can also speak [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=284.4s)]
*  to US politics reporter at The Hill, that's Julia Manchester who joins us from Washington DC. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Julia just talk to us about that rather extraordinary appearance by Elon Musk with [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=297.6s)]
*  his son on his shoulders there at the White House, rather unorthodox to say the least. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=302.08s)]
*  Very much so and it comes as there's really been so much democratic resistance here in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  Washington DC to Elon Musk, someone who was unelected, you know and someone who very much [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=311.52s)]
*  has President Trump who was elected his ear. So you have all these protests from Democrats [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=318.08s)]
*  happening in Washington DC but you have Elon Musk sitting by beside right for standing beside [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  President Trump in the Oval Office essentially talking for the majority of the half hour 45 [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  minutes whatever it was of that press conference or pool spray explaining what Doge is and I think [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=336.64s)]
*  it underscores I think a lot of the concerns that Democrats and critics of the administration have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  with Elon Musk's role and also it's happening as we're seeing Doge really cut through a number of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=348.56s)]
*  federal programs try to implement these buyouts go head to head with federal judges in terms of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=355.36s)]
*  whether they can you know take this action. So there's a lot of questions as to you know [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=361.92s)]
*  Elon Musk's role in this Doge's role in this but what I thought was remarkable was how Donald Trump [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=366.24s)]
*  sat there and sort of nodded his head and let Elon Musk take a lot of the spotlight. We know [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=372.56s)]
*  that Donald Trump is someone who likes to be the center of the tension he likes to be in the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=377.76s)]
*  spotlight but all indications at least publicly show that he likes Elon Musk in this role. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=381.44s)]
*  Yeah and what do you think the public make of it? I mean as you mentioned the sort of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=386.72s)]
*  various battles in the courts over all of this but I guess many of the people who voted for [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=390.96s)]
*  Donald Trump will say well this is what we voted for big cuts in federal spending. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=395.76s)]
*  Well that's what Elon Musk said actually yesterday in the Oval Office he was said that the American [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=400.8s)]
*  people you know voted for cuts in fraud and abuse in federal spending and bloat in the federal [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=405.68s)]
*  government so that's I think the argument you're hearing from that side of the aisle. However I [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=411.6s)]
*  think there's a lot of other Trump voters who would look at this and say well we didn't [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=417.28s)]
*  necessarily vote for the spectacle if you will that comes along with the Trump administration [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=422.32s)]
*  and seeing Elon Musk in the Oval Office and seeing the you know clashing of the executive [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  branch the presidency and the judicial branch a lot of these federal government or the federal [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=433.84s)]
*  judges I should say so you know I think there is certainly that spectacle that comes along with it [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=440.88s)]
*  but a lot of Republicans I talk to in Washington say look Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=446.64s)]
*  something that Republicans for decades have wanted to do but have been unable to implement. They are [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=452.72s)]
*  you know within the first three weeks of the second Trump administration you know cutting the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=458.32s)]
*  size of the federal workforce dramatically you know posing these challenges constitutionally [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=463.2s)]
*  in many ways to federal judges so they find that you know Elon Musk is moving at breakneck speed. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=468.96s)]
*  They like that because it's never been done in the past. It's fascinating good to talk to you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=475.92s)]
*  Thank you so much Julia Manchester US politics reporter at The Hill joining us there from [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  Washington. Thank you so much. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhxajC4DiQQ&t=485.12s)]
