*  Five Thai citizens are also expected to be freed tomorrow with no exchange for Palestinian prisoners [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=18.78s)]
*  There's been no information provided as to whether they will be returned alive [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=25.0s)]
*  Well, let's go live to Jerusalem and to our correspondent Wera Davis and Wera tell us more [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=29.5s)]
*  Yeah, well as you said this is the latest exchange of hostages for prisoners as part of this fragile ceasefire that's meant to last [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=36.42s)]
*  Six weeks. This is the third [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=45.46s)]
*  Installation of the exchanges and three people are due to be released tomorrow Thursday [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=49.019999999999996s)]

*  Agamberger who's 20. Those two are thought to be the last of the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=60.14s)]
*  Female hostages still thought to be alive. So the final two [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=65.02s)]
*  surviving female hostages we think and an 80 year old man Gadi Moses also due to be released [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=69.38s)]
*  Also and quite unexpectedly Hamas [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=76.14s)]
*  Late in the day said they will be releasing five Thai nationals now a number of Thai nationals and other nationals [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=78.5s)]
*  Nepalese for example were abducted from the kibbutz's where they were working as agricultural workers on October the 7th [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=85.42s)]
*  Not much has been heard about their conditions while they've been in custody [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=91.94s)]
*  But it's understood that five Thai nationals will be released a separate to this ceasefire deal [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=95.58s)]
*  They weren't included in the numbers that were agreed at the start of the ceasefire deal [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=101.34s)]
*  But Hamas have decided to release five Thai nationals as well tomorrow [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=105.22000000000001s)]
*  We're briefly we're getting to the timeline around when [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  Negotiations around phase two are supposed to begin. Where are we with all of that? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=116.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just before that Matthew this important to say that as part of this deal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  110 Palestinians are being released from Israeli jails as well about 30 of those are thought to be [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  Women and children now most of those will be released to their home areas either in occupied East Jerusalem or the West Bank [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=131.22s)]
*  But a number of them according to Israeli media sources are people serving life terms for serious offenses [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=137.66s)]
*  And they will be released or sent into exile in Egypt or other Arab countries [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=143.78s)]
*  But as you say, this is an initial six-week ceasefire deal [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=148.6s)]
*  The due to start talking on Monday about the next phase [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=153.26s)]
*  But there are real concerns that the ceasefire won't last this pressure for example in parts of the Israeli government [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=156.9s)]
*  the hardline right-wing parties who want the resumption of the war in Gaza after this initial six weeks is over because they say [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=163.52s)]
*  Hamas isn't yet defeated militarily that you know if that fails if that all [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=171.74s)]
*  Results in a resumption of the war that will have a catastrophic impact as well for the humanitarian situation in Gaza [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=177.1s)]
*  Where aid more aid has started to trickle in? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=182.46s)]
*  There in Jerusalem. Thanks very much for that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWA6Qtn02GU&t=186.9s)]
