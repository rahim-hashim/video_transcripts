Video Description: Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has won a parliament vote to become Germany's next chancellor at the second attempt.
 
Merz had initially fallen six votes short of the absolute majority he needed on Tuesday morning - a significant blow to his prestige and an unprecedented failure in post-war German history.
 
As it was a secret ballot in the 630-seat Bundestag, there was no indication who had refused to back him - either MPs from his centre-left coalition partner or his own conservatives.
 
After hours of uncertainty in the Bundestag, the parties and the president of the Bundestag agreed to hold a second vote, which Merz then won with 325 votes, a majority of nine.

# Germany's Friedrich Merz wins vote for chancellor after surviving historic defeat | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM)
*  Welcome back. There is a new Chancellor in Germany in the last few minutes. Friedrich [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=0.0s)]
*  Merz has been formally confirmed in his position, but it has not been straightforward for the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=9.36s)]
*  Conservative leader. He lost a confidence vote this morning. He was six votes short [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=15.44s)]
*  of the 316 vote majority that he needed. We are still to hear from Friedrich Merz. The [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=20.56s)]
*  result has only just been announced in the Bundestag. This was the second vote that was [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=27.8s)]
*  arranged hurriedly this afternoon. Let's cross live to our correspondent in Berlin, Jess [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=32.32s)]
*  Parker. A sigh of relief all around, Jess. No doubt. Yes, so just happened, just broken [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=38.08s)]
*  here in the Bundestag. It looks like Friedrich Merz has made it through the second time around. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=47.16s)]
*  What a fascinating and chaotic day it has been to refresh people's memories. This morning [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=53.56s)]
*  we were expecting Friedrich Merz from the centre-right CDU party to be voted in without [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  much fuss because he had a coalition, supposedly with the majority, and then the result came [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  through, bam, he hadn't made it through. He was six votes short of the majority. There [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  has been endless speculation as to how that happened. Which disgruntled MPs from within [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  the coalition might have dissented. But then there was a lot of conversations going on [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=78.32s)]
*  behind closed doors. They went for it a second time. It seems that whoever decided not to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  support Friedrich Merz the first time around, well, a few people have changed their minds [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=88.88s)]
*  and he has made it through. A hugely embarrassing day for Friedrich Merz. He has been trying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=93.72s)]
*  to project strength and certainty, this antidote to the last divided government. This is not [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  how he wanted to start his term in power. I think it has made him look politically weak. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=105.44s)]
*  This was the first time a would-be Chancellor failed to secure a majority in 76 years of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=111.16s)]
*  the German Republic, Jess. It is not the ideal start, as you say. If he is now to form this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  new Cabinet and take over, is he weakened by the loss of that first vote today? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  Yes. As you say, it is not exactly how they wanted things to go today. Friedrich Merz was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=132.48s)]
*  already supposed to have gone to see the President, come back to be sworn in. As you say, he was [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  lined up with his Cabinet. Members of his Cabinet yesterday, I was there at an event [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=146.16s)]
*  here in Berlin, an old Gasworks building, they were signing the coalition deal from [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=150.67999999999998s)]
*  different members of the different parties to say that they had come to this agreement [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=155.56s)]
*  and it all looked like it was going to go very smoothly. I think a question now for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=159.96s)]
*  Friedrich Merz. He struggled to get through as Chancellor, despite having a narrow majority [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=164.28s)]
*  in Parliament with this coalition, but a majority nonetheless. Does this mean he is going to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=172.08s)]
*  struggle to get key, contentious legislation through this Parliament? There will also be [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  the big question, as yet an answer, because it is a secret ballot here, who were these [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=182.56s)]
*  people who voted against him or did not vote for him? Were they members of his own Conservative [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=186.76s)]
*  CDU who do not like his leadership style? Remember, this is a man who took three goes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=192.84s)]
*  to become leader of his party, so there have been lots of questions over his popularity [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=197.0s)]
*  within the party. Or were they figures from within the centre-left, SPD, dissatisfied [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  with their leadership or indeed the coalition agreement? We do not know, but it is an uncomfortable [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=206.88s)]
*  moment for the new Chancellor. He will hope to try and get back on track now. He is supposed [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=212.56s)]
*  to be whizzing off to Paris and Warsaw tomorrow as part of a big tour to try and rebuild frayed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=217.48s)]
*  ties as he sees it with important European partners. But Paris and Warsaw will have noticed [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=223.04s)]
*  what has happened and it is all pretty embarrassing for the new Chancellor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNERDlWnJqM&t=228.88s)]
