Video Description: Finland has just completed a major basic income experiment where 2,000 unemployed people were given €560 (£490) a month for two years, instead of their unemployment benefit.
The basic income was paid with no strings attached. Recipients weren't required to seek or accept jobs but still received the payment if they found a job.
The Finnish government wanted to see if this financial incentive encouraged people to get jobs or start businesses.
The BBC followed two participants, Tanja and Tuomas, for two years to see what impact free money had on their lives.
Producer: Erika Benke. Camera: Richard Perry and Maxim Lomakin.

# Did Finland's basic income experiment work? - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg)
*  My name is Tanja, I'm 30 years old. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=30.0s)]
*  I live in Aulu in Northern Finland. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=33.0s)]
*  And I have only worked four or five months in a factory. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=37.36s)]
*  I don't remember the last time [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=43.44s)]
*  that I went to store and bought food. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I get food from my mom. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=50.96s)]
*  That's so embarrassing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=54.32s)]
*  I want to work and I want to be able to go to the store [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=56.52s)]
*  and buy my own food and buy whatever I want. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  I want that cheese and I want to be able to buy [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=63.64s)]
*  the good cheese, you know? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  My name is Tuomas Muraja. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=76.64s)]
*  I'm a freelance journalist and an author. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  I have been without work since 2013. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=82.36s)]
*  I was a foreign news editor [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=89.28s)]
*  in the third daily newspaper in Finland. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=91.36s)]
*  But then they decided to put down all the section [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=95.2s)]
*  of the foreign affairs, so basically I lost my job. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=99.28s)]
*  It's not easy to find a job as a journalist [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=105.4s)]
*  in the capital of Finland. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=109.4s)]
*  It's not always easy for me to find one job [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=112.56s)]
*  because I use [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=116.6s)]
*  Hi! Tanja is calling here! Good day! [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=134.0s)]
*  It's telemarketing! [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=138.0s)]
*  I actually enjoy my job a lot. I love my co-workers. I love the office, I love the hours. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=140.0s)]
*  And I just love to be being independent, earning my own money and standing on my own two feet. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=150.0s)]
*  Tell me, is it okay? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=160.0s)]
*  Basic income has changed my life. Without it, I couldn't have taken a job with a little lower salary. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=161.0s)]
*  At first I was quite skeptical about basic income, but then I realized it is actually a genius idea. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=176.0s)]
*  I think I have turned my life around. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=185.0s)]
*  I'm still without a job. I can't say that the basic income has changed a lot in my life. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=192.0s)]
*  Okay, psychologically, yes, but financially, not so much. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=201.0s)]
*  I have still over one year to go, so anything can happen. So I'm quite optimistic. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=208.0s)]
*  Let's see, during summertime next year I'll have a job. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=214.0s)]
*  I'm still looking forward to the next year. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=221.0s)]
*  Oh my god! Basic income is coming to an end. What do I do now? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=232.0s)]
*  I'm so worried I can't pay my loans. I don't know what to do. I'm so worried that my finances will collapse completely. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=240.0s)]
*  Good! Good! I'll give you a hug. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=252.0s)]
*  If they don't give me the pay rise that I have asked, I will go to the internet and take the first job that I get. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=265.0s)]
*  I will make tens and tens of applications so that I won't have to be unemployed for even one day. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=275.0s)]
*  It's very hard to say why I don't manage to get the permanent job because I have applied over 80 times. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=290.0s)]
*  And only once I have been to an interview. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=299.0s)]
*  Sometimes they suggest or they let me know that I'm perhaps too old, I'm perhaps too experienced. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=305.0s)]
*  Two years ago it was like winning a lottery. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=314.0s)]
*  The end of bureaucracy, I was free to concentrate myself to my work. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=322.0s)]
*  Now I feel a little bit sad. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=330.0s)]
*  And I got this letter telling me that it's going to end. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=337.0s)]
*  Quite sad, but I'm not lost my hope. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=343.0s)]
*  Thank you for watching! [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPQM54oPMg&t=360.0s)]
