# What next for US President Trump's tariff plan? Newscast answers your questions | BBC Newscast
**BBC - World News:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE)
*  What a week it has been and we've had lots of your questions about President Donald Trump's tariffs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=0.0s)]
*  and we are going to try to answer as many of them as we can on this episode of Newscast. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=6.4s)]
*  Hello, it's James in the studio. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=14.64s)]
*  Hello, it's Alexi in Westminster. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=16.48s)]
*  Hello, it's Katrina in Washington. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=19.36s)]
*  And it's Darshini in the studio. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=21.6s)]
*  Right, thank you all so much. It's lovely to all be together in the week where [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=23.52s)]
*  you Darshini and probably you Katrina and probably you Alex as well have all been somewhat [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=30.08s)]
*  exhausted by the ups and downs, the roller coaster, as we were saying on other newscasts [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=34.96s)]
*  this week in the markets because we've been following Donald Trump's tariffs from the moment [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  last Wednesday when he revealed them on that huge piece of cardboard, I suppose it was. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  And then the twist came this Wednesday. And I would like to know where were you all when [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=50.24s)]
*  we read the post on Truth Social from President Trump announcing he would pause the higher rate [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=56.64s)]
*  of tariffs for 90 days while raising the tariff on China to 125 percent? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=61.04s)]
*  I think the answer is easy, isn't it? I was here with you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=67.6s)]
*  You've got the easiest answer. You were here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=70.16s)]
*  Did we jinx it? Is this going to happen again tonight? I just need to know. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=72.8s)]
*  I was here and we had to react in real time, which was, you know, fascinating. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=76.4s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=79.76s)]
*  I've got slightly less interesting, but perhaps more revelatory answer. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=81.2s)]
*  So I was here in the Westminster studio poised, ready to record newscast and to talk about [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=85.44s)]
*  another very important issue. But then this happened and I got this lovely what's that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=91.36s)]
*  message on my phone from the brilliant newscast team saying, oh, I'm so sorry, we think we're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=96.48s)]
*  going to have to deal with this announcement now so we don't need you. So I was unceremoniously dumped [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=100.08s)]
*  from newscast while that big statement from Donald Trump popped up on Truth Social. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=104.56s)]
*  I'm sorry about that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=108.96s)]
*  No, not at all. Not at all. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, I was in a different place entirely. I was out on the road in Miami South Beach when [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=111.36s)]
*  I saw the announcement in 30 degrees sunshine. All right, you win. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=116.64s)]
*  But interesting. It was big, big news there because, you know, obviously it's kind of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=124.08s)]
*  Florida's the adopted home of Donald Trump. But I've been speaking to so many people about [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  the tariffs and the impact it was having down there on all kinds of walks of life. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=134.48s)]
*  And then you see the China point and suddenly people are worrying about, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=139.68s)]
*  you know, beach toys and flip flops and all these kind of cheap disposable goods that are [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=143.6s)]
*  imported from China as well as all the other really important things that we'll talk about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=149.68s)]
*  for the rest of the episode. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=154.16s)]
*  Yeah. And actually talking of that, let's start there because we've had loads of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=155.44s)]
*  questions from newscasts. Thank you so much, everybody, for getting in touch. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  But there's one thing that has happened quite recently is that the White House has said on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=164.32s)]
*  Thursday afternoon, and she'd say we're recording Thursday evening, about three minutes to seven, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=168.16s)]
*  as it is now. On Thursday afternoon, the White House said that the tariffs on China are not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=173.76s)]
*  125 percent, but 145 percent. Darshini, why has that been revised up? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=178.4s)]
*  This had a lot of people scratching their heads. And in truth, nothing has actually [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=186.0s)]
*  changed since yesterday in terms of that announcement, because what is actually going [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=189.68s)]
*  on here is you've got 125 percent. That's the extra tariffs that's been announced since [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=194.08s)]
*  so-called Liberation Day, right? Ahead of that, 20 percent had been announced, so-called fentanyl [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=200.56s)]
*  tariffs related to that particular policy by President Trump. So if you add those up, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=207.44s)]
*  you get 145. But, you know, when we talk about what's happened over the last week, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  eight days, to be quite precise, it is 125 percent. But however you look at it, it amounts to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=216.4s)]
*  what I kind of call a deepening of conscious uncoupling. That was the Gwyneth Paltrow. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin. Chris Martin divorce thing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=227.92s)]
*  Totally. This is a deepening of the split between the two biggest trading nations on the planet. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  And, Katrina, here I suppose is a deceptively straightforward question. Why this, as they say [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=236.64s)]
*  in journalism, reverse ferret? I mean, the question everyone's asking, and this is hotly [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=244.64s)]
*  disputed, is was this or was Donald Trump's plan all along? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=249.84s)]
*  Straightforward question, not a straightforward answer. I think the quickest answer is we just [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=255.28s)]
*  don't know, to be honest. You know, we know that Donald Trump sees China as the number one competitor [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=261.04s)]
*  for the US. We also know that he views that kind of strategic competition, as he calls it, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  as the biggest threat to national security in this country, as he did during his first [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=273.2s)]
*  administration. That same philosophy has carried through here. Did he intend to get into such a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=278.08s)]
*  massive, massive trade war with China? That's the bit we don't know. And we were getting very mixed [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=284.24s)]
*  messages from the White House yesterday as to just what the plan was here. Members of his team [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=290.24s)]
*  briefing the media saying, oh yeah, this was all a negotiation. This is what he intended. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=295.76s)]
*  And then hearing from the President Trump, as we played a little earlier at that point, about him [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=300.24s)]
*  taking action based on the markets being yippy. But the impact of this, the point from China and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=304.64s)]
*  those massive tariffs, that's the part where you have to wonder, did he actually intend that? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=311.36s)]
*  Because it's going to have a massive impact on American consumers and it's going to have a massive [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=316.32s)]
*  impact on American exporters as well. And at the end of the day, that baseline tariff of 10% [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=321.52s)]
*  still exists on every other country in the world and we know 25% on steel and aluminium. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  So this kind of, hey, look over here thing at China, is kind of detracting attention away from [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=335.44s)]
*  the fact that this is not a pause in tariffs and of itself announcing that 10% would have been a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=340.56s)]
*  massive deal if it was just that. Yeah. And Alex, one of the countries affected is of course this [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=347.12s)]
*  country, arguably in a worse position now than before, or at least a worse position relative to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=353.44s)]
*  some other nations in the world, including the 27 members of the EU. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=361.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, worse position, it depends how you define it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=365.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, sorry, that's a good point. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=367.84s)]
*  Officially in the same position, of course, because, you know, the UK was one of the countries [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=369.36s)]
*  that was hit by that 10% baseline tariff aside from steel, aluminium and cars. And they were [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=373.52s)]
*  looking like they were in a better position because other countries, the EU bloc, for example, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=379.76s)]
*  had higher level of tariffs. Now, of course, with the pause, everybody's at this 10% level bar China. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=384.8s)]
*  So the UK is in the same position. But when you talk to Downing Street, I don't know that they see [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=389.92s)]
*  that the UK is kind of lost out from this really at this stage. I mean, they're still trying to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=395.2s)]
*  negotiate something that would see that 10% tariff alleviated, whether they get there or not, we don't know. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=400.0s)]
*  What sort of thing? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, they're talking about and have talked about for a while. It kind of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=406.4s)]
*  went from from a sort of economic agreement to something more akin to a bit of a trade deal. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=409.36s)]
*  You know, the details of which we just don't know, there's been lots of speculation about [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=415.12s)]
*  what might be on the table around that, you know, sort of like online regulation or big digital [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=418.72s)]
*  tech company taxes or agriculture or whatever else it might be. We don't know the details of it, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=424.56s)]
*  to be fair, but they're hoping that they might be able to do something that sees even that 10% [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  tariff come down. Interestingly, I was with the Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  talking to him this afternoon and I asked him, you know, how close do you think you are to that? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  And he said, look, you know, with our teams are talking, we're in an advanced stage, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=442.88s)]
*  but he was very clear that he didn't know and couldn't predict what level any tariff might be [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  even after a trade deal, if it were to be reached. And he was really clear that even if they did [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=452.88s)]
*  manage to get some sort of deal arrangement that saw that 10% lowered or gotten rid of all together, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=458.96s)]
*  then the UK would still be massively impacted by what's going on more widely, you know, and that is, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=465.44s)]
*  there is a real, real awareness of that within number 10. He was saying, look, there's no sense [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=470.0s)]
*  that in two to three months, this has all gone away. You know, what is happening globally, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=474.56s)]
*  it's going to have a very direct impact on the UK, whatever arrangement the government might, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=478.64s)]
*  might strike with the White House. Yeah. And, and we talked on Thursday's newscast about [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  the great difficulty in striking any agreement for among other reasons, the impact on UK businesses [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=488.32s)]
*  and farms, potentially of goods coming from the US integration of trade with the European Union and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=495.28s)]
*  how different rules on different goods, particularly agriculture might affect them. And then the key [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=501.12s)]
*  thing, can you even trust Donald Trump who's blown up so many trade deals? But I mean, that we've [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=505.68s)]
*  talked about that a bit on Thursday's episode, Darnishini, before we get into, and we will in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=509.76s)]
*  just two seconds get into a whole list of questions from newscasters. Last thing, it is, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=514.32s)]
*  we are recording Thursday night just to catch up with the markets because it's such a seesaw, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=519.5200000000001s)]
*  you know, obviously it is huge slump, big bounce back when Donald Trump retreats. And now what? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=527.7600000000001s)]
*  And now buyers' remorse seems to be settling in as we speak, the US markets are still open and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  they've been very shaky and they've been down quite sharply. And it seems to be, how do we have [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=540.88s)]
*  that initial euphoria when we were sat here 24 hours ago with the pause being announced and we [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=544.96s)]
*  saw the markets shooting up, we've seen a little bit of a, you know, a step back and all the things [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=550.72s)]
*  we've been talking about, the fact that there are still risks, not just American growth, but Chinese [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=557.04s)]
*  growth and global growth. And also this sort of vacuum and which in which businesses don't know [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=562.08s)]
*  which way to turn or what to do, they'll paralyse by fear because, you know, quite frankly, this is [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=567.36s)]
*  the president who can change his mind in a matter of minutes, it seems. Exactly. Now let's get into [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=572.4s)]
*  some of these questions. Philip Jones, thanks so much, Philip, for getting in touch with a really [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=577.04s)]
*  interesting question. And that is, is it possible, sort of relates to what we're talking about, the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=580.96s)]
*  politics here, is it possible that Trump's tariffs are actually a political power play rather than an [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  economic policy and therefore potentially more serious for the UK in the long term? Katrina, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=592.96s)]
*  first, what's, that's part of the debate, really, isn't it? It is. And it's good to pose that question [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=599.36s)]
*  because I do think it's a bit of both. You know, we know that President Trump engages an approach [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  called transactional diplomacy, where everything is a give and a take. And from his perspective, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=613.36s)]
*  he wants people to be giving to him. And we've seen that since he's come into office, particularly [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=618.96s)]
*  this second time around. I mean, very early on, slapping tariffs on Colombia, the Colombian [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=624.64s)]
*  president gave him what he wanted. He lifted the tariffs. Similar happened in Mexico early on. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=629.36s)]
*  So we know it is kind of a political game plan for him, but he is also wedded to the economics of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=634.88s)]
*  this. And he does seem to think that ultimately this tariff back and forward, even if it results [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=643.12s)]
*  in a trade war, will result in manufacturing moving to the US. Now, plenty of people are not [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=649.76s)]
*  in agreement with him on that approach. And obviously we've seen what's happened on the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=656.0s)]
*  markets and just that uncertainty, which is what everyone has been complaining about for weeks. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=660.4s)]
*  And we're in as uncertain a time as ever in a way now. So I do think it's a bit of both. And [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=665.28s)]
*  actually it'll be only with the benefit of hindsight and the passage of time that we'll [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=672.0s)]
*  know actually what he was planning. Alex? Yeah, I mean, exactly that. Like, who really knows what [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=675.92s)]
*  is in the mind of Donald Trump right now and what his strategy was and what he claims his strategy [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=684.08s)]
*  was now might be quite different to what it actually was at the outset, you know, and what [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=688.0s)]
*  the long term consequences might be. But from a UK political perspective, I think what is interesting [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=692.72s)]
*  and what this period in particular has really cemented in the minds of ministers is that they [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=697.84s)]
*  always knew to some degree what they were getting with Donald Trump in the White House, because of [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=703.12s)]
*  course this is his second term, you know, and they knew that he would be unpredictable and they knew [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=706.88s)]
*  he would be transactional and all of those words that we spoke about quite a lot when once Donald [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=711.2s)]
*  Trump had won the election and before he actually took office in the White House. But I think what [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=716.24s)]
*  has really become clear, and even though ministers and the government are very careful in the language [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=720.0s)]
*  that they use publicly when it comes to Donald Trump and they don't want to inflame or antagonise [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=726.32s)]
*  and they kind of walk this careful diplomatic line, what is abundantly clear to them is that they are [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=731.0400000000001s)]
*  dealing with an even more volatile Donald Trump in the White House this time around, if that's [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=736.6400000000001s)]
*  possible. And so what that is doing here is really shaping the political response and you are seeing [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=740.96s)]
*  now with the language that's coming out of government about the world has changed, you know, we have to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=746.32s)]
*  respond to a new changed world. I think that has been a sort of dawning realisation that they are [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=750.88s)]
*  going to have to approach this differently and it is going to have an impact on the decisions they're [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=756.56s)]
*  making in government. And we've also had a few questions from newscasters about how tariffs [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=760.72s)]
*  actually work in practice and Dave says, thanks Dave, says, great to hear how the stock and bond [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=764.96s)]
*  markets are doing in all this turmoil. I can't tell if Dave's being sarcastic about that or not, but [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=772.08s)]
*  anyway, nonetheless, Dave goes on, but does anyone know what difference the US consumers are now [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=777.44s)]
*  seeing in their retail outlets? If not, Darshini, then how long until they start to see this [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=783.36s)]
*  spilting through to them? That's Dave's question. That's a really, it's a brilliant question, Dave, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  thank you. And the question is, we're not quite sure, you know, things happen very rapidly. We [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=793.5200000000001s)]
*  have ships that can cross water in a matter of a few days to get goods over between China and the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  US, right? So you would imagine that you would see the response quite quickly, but every producer [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=806.64s)]
*  is different, every importer is different, every consumer is different, right? So you don't know, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=811.84s)]
*  companies in China are saying, do we take a hit? Do we try and, and we know some of them are doing [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=818.0s)]
*  this, by the way, do we try and rejig our supply chain? Say to some of them, you're going to take [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=822.48s)]
*  a hit so we can reduce the price we are charging to America so when the tariff gets put on top, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=826.64s)]
*  that isn't going to have so much of an effect. It's very difficult, of course, to absorb something [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=832.0s)]
*  of that size. So you're going to see some price effect. We've heard President Trump saying already, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=835.68s)]
*  and we don't know if this is definitely the case, but he claims that already they are netting an [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=840.7199999999999s)]
*  extra $2 billion per day in tariff revenue, right? And much of that will be coming from China, if [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=845.76s)]
*  that is the case. And the question is, on whom is that burden falling? Is it consumers or is it [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=852.0799999999999s)]
*  importers? Where is that, where is the split there? But quite honestly, already consumers will be [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=858.9599999999999s)]
*  noticing some higher prices. And we've had a question on that exact point, Darshini, from [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=864.0s)]
*  Eric, who says, I've just heard President Trump on the radio boasting that the US is already taking [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=869.04s)]
*  in $2 billion a day from the tariffs. Is this figure actually true? Or is this a complete [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=874.08s)]
*  fabrication? Thanks, says Eric Anderson, brackets big fan of the podcast. Oh, thanks, Eric. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=879.68s)]
*  And Donald Trump said just a short time ago, at a cabinet meeting that for some reason is now [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=884.96s)]
*  televised, he said, Oh, it's actually three and a half billion dollars a day out of nowhere. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=891.92s)]
*  Right. Having said two billion. The country is making approximately $2 billion a day. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=897.68s)]
*  And when you think of it, that's we've never done that before. Never come close to it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  And the number is probably three and a half billion dollars a day. Katrina, what's on your [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=911.92s)]
*  side of things? What's the feeling about whether anyone has managed to fact check this $2 billion [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=919.2s)]
*  a day, let alone to three and a half billion? Can't be both. Yeah, there were quite a few [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=924.4000000000001s)]
*  raised eyebrows when he said that three and a half billion dollars at the cabinet meeting [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=929.76s)]
*  a little earlier. And the truth is that the White House hasn't put forward any statistical evidence [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=933.6800000000001s)]
*  of this tax take. The Treasury Department does put out a daily statement of kind of deposits and [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=939.6s)]
*  withdrawals out of the general account, if you like. And that main account seems to show an average [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=946.0s)]
*  of about $200 million a day so far this month. So not sure how the $200 million is getting to [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=952.72s)]
*  $3.5 billion. But obviously, the president must have access to figures and statistics that the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=961.92s)]
*  rest of us don't have. But here at the BBC and everywhere else, I'm sure has asked for some [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=968.08s)]
*  documentary evidence of those figures and we will bring them to you when we get them. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=973.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is a really interesting one, isn't it? Because at the moment, as Katrina says, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=979.52s)]
*  we're pretty much in the dark about what's happening in real time. But talking to some [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=982.7199999999999s)]
*  economists out there, they say if you saw the amount being bought from the likes of China [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=986.88s)]
*  staying constant, the American economy could face paying out an extra, I think it's something like [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=991.76s)]
*  $850 billion per year in tariffs at the moment, right? So if you take that figure and divide it [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=998.48s)]
*  up and do all those kinds of things, you could come up with a figure of billions of dollars per [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  day. But we simply don't know. And that assumes that the amount being bought in America or of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1009.52s)]
*  these goods that are coming in stays constant. Whereas in reality, as we know, if you double the [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1013.52s)]
*  price of something, people are going to think twice about buying it, they probably won't buy it at all. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1017.12s)]
*  And actually, just as a side note, another question that we've noticed or some members of the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1021.6800000000001s)]
*  fantastic newscast team have noticed today that people have been searching online is how will this [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1026.8s)]
*  impact the cost of an iPhone in the US? And I imagine that's of great concern because of course, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  they're made in China. Now, lots of newscasters though are based not in the States, although some [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1036.56s)]
*  are, but here in the UK, like Sarah, who sent us this voice note. Hi there, newscast. And thank [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  you for everything that you do. I keep hearing so much about the impact of tariffs on US consumers. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1048.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm really interested in your views on what it might mean for us in the UK. I know it's difficult [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1056.48s)]
*  to predict given all the very rapid changes, but it would still be really interesting to understand [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1063.28s)]
*  whether there are things we should do to prepare for such an uncertain and risky future. Thanks [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1069.8400000000001s)]
*  very much. Bye, Sarah. Thank you, Sarah. I like you put your name on the end. That was that was [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1075.6000000000001s)]
*  good. I like that. Alex, that must be a real concern here for the UK government. It must be [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1081.36s)]
*  worried about the effect on consumers and also the effect therefore on growth. Yeah, I mean, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1086.8s)]
*  Darshania will be better on the direct impact on personal finances. But I think the major headache [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1092.0s)]
*  is that, and this comes back to that point, no matter what the tariff on the UK specifically is, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1096.8s)]
*  if you are in a period of such global economic uncertainty, it is going to have an impact here. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1101.36s)]
*  And that really is twofold. The first thing is about uncertainty itself. You know, there's been [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1105.9199999999998s)]
*  this big push from government to get people to invest. And obviously, when businesses are facing [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1110.48s)]
*  such economic uncertainty, the idea of investing is more risky, and they might not be so keen to [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1115.28s)]
*  do it. And the other thing is that we are for so long, and we've been hearing the government talk [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1120.56s)]
*  about growth as their number one mission, a thing they really want to get going in the economy. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1126.08s)]
*  And in some way, the kind of answer to a lot of their economic challenges, you know, they think [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1130.64s)]
*  if they can get the economy growing, crucially, that's going to provide lots of money for public [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1134.96s)]
*  services. Now, of course, if the economy doesn't grow as a consequence of all this, that is going [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1138.64s)]
*  to mean some quite difficult choices for the government because the public finances were [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1143.2800000000002s)]
*  already looking pretty tight. And we know that there is a spending review penciled in for June [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1146.96s)]
*  when the government's going to look at how much it's spending on all sorts of public services. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1151.68s)]
*  And then there's a budget in the autumn with tax and spending decisions. And so I think that is [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1155.2800000000002s)]
*  the immediate headache from a government perspective. And that could have a very real [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1161.2s)]
*  consequence because, you know, if the numbers go the wrong way, and it does mean that the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1165.52s)]
*  government has to make some decisions around tax and spend, that could affect public services [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1169.2s)]
*  and your taxes. Now, the government obviously is sort of saying at the moment is committing to its [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1173.36s)]
*  things about personal taxation not going up and fiscal rules and all that are still in play. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1177.84s)]
*  But I think that is going to be on the minds of ministers very, very acutely in coming weeks. And [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1182.56s)]
*  that could filter down to you and I, you know, you could notice those kind of things. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1187.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're also promising a campaign of rearmament and spending billions on the military [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1191.28s)]
*  and a strategic defense review looking into that. And they're talking about potentially [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1196.32s)]
*  nationalizing British steel. I mean, Rachel Reeves is going to need to scrambling around. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1199.76s)]
*  And the spending review was looking tight before this. You know, we were already hearing that the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1204.24s)]
*  spending review is going to be difficult and there'd be difficult decisions and difficult [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1208.0s)]
*  choices before any of this. And that's all just become potentially a lot, lot harder. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1210.96s)]
*  Darsheen, just back to Sarah's question. She said, how might we best prepare [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1215.6s)]
*  the U.K. as ordinary consumers? Well, it's a very good question, Sarah. And it's quite nuanced, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1219.76s)]
*  this one, because as Alex was saying there, there are concerns about growth and their concerns as [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1225.04s)]
*  well. I've got to say about businesses investing and creating jobs. So that's one thing to look [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1229.36s)]
*  out for this, as we were hearing their concerns to about what this could mean for the public [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1235.4399999999998s)]
*  finances. But it's a bit of a silver lining here that we don't often talk about. And if you look [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1239.84s)]
*  at what's happening in the bigger picture, lots of markets are moving at the moment, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1244.1599999999999s)]
*  including the price of oil. We talked about this, didn't we, before. The price of oil has [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1247.44s)]
*  been coming down. It's still been coming down over the course of today. And other commodities [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1251.3600000000001s)]
*  have got cheaper as well. There are also, if you talk to some retailers, for example, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1255.76s)]
*  in this country, they're saying, well, there is a case of thinking there will be unsold goods [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1260.56s)]
*  in China that they'll try and sell here instead at bargain prices. So actually, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1265.76s)]
*  there could be a beneficial impact on us in terms of lower inflation. What does lower inflation [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1270.96s)]
*  tend to mean? Lower interest rates. If you look at what's expected from the Bank of England, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1276.16s)]
*  they are expected to cut rates more frequently this year, for example. So there could be some [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1280.8000000000002s)]
*  things that actually benefit consumers. And it's something to watch out for. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1286.3200000000002s)]
*  I was about to ask you a question that's so awful, which was, what about pensions and mortgages? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1289.76s)]
*  Can you just do that in two sentences, please? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1296.64s)]
*  I can do pensions. Yes. Pensions, obviously, are linked. Most pension funds are linked to the value [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1298.72s)]
*  of the stock market. They have still not gathered, I mean, regrouped and got all their strength back. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1303.84s)]
*  You don't really have to do it in two sentences. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1308.24s)]
*  Okay, I was going to try. Let me start again. Okay. Pensions and mortgages, to put it briefly, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1310.6399999999999s)]
*  pensions, a lot of those funds are linked to movements in investments, like stocks. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1316.1599999999999s)]
*  So what we've seen recently is they have reduced in value quite a bit. The stock market hasn't [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1321.4399999999998s)]
*  regained its former footing quite as yet. But don't forget, many pensions are only drawn down [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1326.48s)]
*  in the long term. So unless you're taking out your pension and drawing down right now, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1332.56s)]
*  it may not be a problem. It could actually recover in the longer term. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1335.76s)]
*  Mortgage is an interesting one. We're seeing a lot of lenders. I talked there about [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1339.12s)]
*  the chance of interest rates coming down more quickly this year. We're already seeing some [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1343.76s)]
*  lenders bringing down their mortgage rates in response to that. And that is something to watch [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1347.52s)]
*  out for if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of people who are looking to remortgage this year. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1352.8799999999999s)]
*  That is very interesting. Thank you. Now, earlier, we recorded an episode with Henry, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1357.36s)]
*  in which I asked him to submit a question. And here is what Henry wants to know. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1364.0s)]
*  So what I'd love to know, if we can know this at this point, is, are the Democrats now the party of [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1367.84s)]
*  free trade? Are they back to the world of NAFTA, of reducing barriers to trade and making America [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1375.36s)]
*  wealthy that way? Or actually, are they trying to walk a tightrope where they're saying, well, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1380.7199999999998s)]
*  actually, we would like car factories in Detroit, but we wouldn't do it quite like this in the way [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1386.08s)]
*  that the president did. That, Katrina, is a very interesting question, isn't it? Because lots of [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1391.6s)]
*  people talk about the battleground, the key battleground in American politics in elections, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1397.1999999999998s)]
*  being these states that used to have big manufacturing bases, your Pennsylvanias and [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1402.32s)]
*  Michigan's and Wisconsin's and so on, where the Democrats traditionally were strong and where [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1407.76s)]
*  the Republicans have made inroads. So, yeah, what is the Democrats' position? Henry asks it, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1412.48s)]
*  are they the party of free trade? I think we've seen a lot of movement backwards and forwards [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1418.88s)]
*  between the Republicans and the Democrats, actually, in the last couple of decades between [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1425.6s)]
*  being in favor of free trade and liberalization and protectionism. Obviously, what we've seen here [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1431.44s)]
*  with President Trump and these tariffs is protectionism, but the Democrats are a little [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1436.4s)]
*  at sea as to how they should respond to it because you do hear those same points from Democrats. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1442.24s)]
*  You can go back as far as JFK making speeches in Pennsylvania talking about bringing back [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1448.48s)]
*  good solid manufacturing jobs. They still say that, and in particular, those who are elected [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1453.3600000000001s)]
*  in the states, so the governors and more local level representatives, that is a big talking point. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1459.52s)]
*  So, interestingly, and I don't know if this was the context which Henry was speaking earlier, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1466.5600000000002s)]
*  we had the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, in the White House yesterday for another meeting [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1472.64s)]
*  with President Trump and she also delivered a speech in Washington, D.C. where she was talking [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  about the need for building factories and building ships and bringing back these sorts of jobs to [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1481.8400000000001s)]
*  her state in particular. And President Trump gave her a shout out in the Oval Office about what a [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1487.8400000000001s)]
*  great woman she was and what a great job she was doing in Michigan, which has caused a lot of her [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1492.8s)]
*  colleagues to sort of rally on her and round on her and kind of say, what were you doing in there [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1497.04s)]
*  with him using that language? But actually, it is also for Democrats to say those things and they [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1502.3999999999999s)]
*  do say those things. And it's an example of kind of how at sea they still are in many ways. They [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1509.52s)]
*  just haven't figured out what is their plan to combat Donald Trump. Do they resist him [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1516.1599999999999s)]
*  or do they try and coexist with him? And when you live in a swing state like Gretchen Whitmer does [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1522.64s)]
*  in Michigan and you've eyes on the Oval Office yourself in twenty twenty eight, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1527.6000000000001s)]
*  you kind of have to figure out a way to be a bit of both. I remember covering the election campaign [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1532.0s)]
*  for the twenty sixteen election, but as far back as twenty fifteen, I remember Hillary Clinton, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  who'd been a very strong supporter of free trade, breaking with Barack Obama in opposing the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1542.16s)]
*  Trans-Pacific Partnership deal with various Asian nations and I think also Australia. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1548.4s)]
*  And that was a big moment. And it seemed pretty obvious that that was raw politics rather than [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1555.8400000000001s)]
*  economic belief on her part. But I mean, this rumbles on for the Democrats, but perhaps that's [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1561.1200000000001s)]
*  part of the issue here is that they're struggling to find a coherent economic position. Indeed. And [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1567.52s)]
*  it's fascinating, isn't it? When you look at the Inflation Reduction Act that happened under [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1571.76s)]
*  President Biden, for example, was a different way of helping American businesses trying to [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1575.6799999999998s)]
*  achieve the same goal. I give them a little bit of a leg up, so to speak, so that they could boost [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1580.8799999999999s)]
*  production. Is this a various economists have posed this question to me. Is this President Trump [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1586.3999999999999s)]
*  looking for the same goal by different means? And which one is better ultimately if you're [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1592.1599999999999s)]
*  subsidizing your businesses or is it penalizing the rest of the world? Well, as we can see, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1597.36s)]
*  tariffs may have the more painful fallout. Yeah, and the questions for the UK government as well. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1602.16s)]
*  But actually, let's go to Susan's question. Susan sent us a question on the Newscast Discord, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1607.68s)]
*  which sort of links into this a different way of asking how these things are being viewed [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1613.0400000000002s)]
*  in the UK and how they've changed over time. I think this is I've been wondering this a little [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1618.3200000000002s)]
*  bit myself. A question for the newscast team says Susan, how do you think Margaret Thatcher would be [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1623.28s)]
*  responding to Trump's tariffs if she were still alive and prime minister now? Alex? What a question. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1628.72s)]
*  It's good, isn't it? It's a great question. It really does make you think. It really does make you think. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1635.04s)]
*  Do you know, far be it for me to presume I would know how Margaret Thatcher would respond to [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1639.44s)]
*  anything as prime minister. But I think the couple of things immediately spring to mind [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1645.76s)]
*  and that she was obviously famously committed, you know, to the idea of a free market. I mean, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1649.68s)]
*  this was her big thing. So I think on that level, she would have fundamentally disagreed [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1654.56s)]
*  as a point of principle. But then the converse thing to that, which would have posed perhaps [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1660.08s)]
*  something of a dilemma, is that when she was prime minister, she had a very close relationship with [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1664.24s)]
*  the US President Ronald Reagan. So I mean, and that UK-US relationship then, as they say it is now, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1668.88s)]
*  a special relationship, you know, it was remarked upon repeatedly. So would she have had it been, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1676.24s)]
*  it wouldn't have been Ronald Reagan that was doing this, but had it been, would she have stood up to [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1682.48s)]
*  him? I don't know. Would she stand up to Donald Trump? I think that's the point though, Alex, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1686.0s)]
*  isn't it? They had that relationship that was so close, almost as soulmates, because they agreed [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1689.68s)]
*  so completely on trade and on the way the economy should run, didn't they? I mean, maybe it's, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1695.44s)]
*  you can't disentangle the two things. No, and then you have to also add into the fact that she was [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1702.08s)]
*  seen very much as a strong leader. Now, what would that dynamic be like? I think it would be really [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1706.64s)]
*  interesting. It would be utterly fascinating to see how they would interact if they were, you know, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1711.68s)]
*  sat in the Oval Office together in front of the fire. Some might argue that Donald Trump is a [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1716.64s)]
*  person that would respond to strength. Who knows? I mean, who knows? But certainly from an economic [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1722.8s)]
*  and trade policy perspective, her view would have been very different to the course of action that [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1727.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is currently taking. How she would have dealt with him as a politician, wow, that's [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1733.52s)]
*  anybody's guess, isn't it? I mean, that would have been a very interesting dynamic. I should say, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1737.68s)]
*  in fairness, Keir Starmer did attract quite a lot of praise for the way he handled Donald Trump on [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1742.16s)]
*  his position. And you wonder whether or not Margaret Thatcher, I mean, like I say, I don't know. I'm [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1746.4s)]
*  totally speculating here. I have no idea how she actually would have responded. But, you know, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1749.52s)]
*  it is interesting that when you listen to the Conservative Party of today, you know, they are [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1754.0800000000002s)]
*  not necessarily criticising Keir Starmer's, the position that he's taken when it comes to Donald [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1758.64s)]
*  Trump and tariffs. You know, there hasn't been a sort of call for immediate retaliation from the [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1765.04s)]
*  Conservative Party. They have supported the notion that the government is trying to negotiate some [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1769.12s)]
*  sort of trade deal or, you know, early on some sort of carve out from the tariffs that they're [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1774.48s)]
*  attempting to reach. So they've supported those positions. Their criticism much more has come [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1779.44s)]
*  from the environment that they see that the Labour government has created for business in the UK when [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1782.8799999999999s)]
*  it comes to things like national insurance. That's been their kind of real point of descent. But in [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1787.6s)]
*  terms of the broad approach that Keir Starmer has taken, they haven't really pushed back against [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1794.32s)]
*  that. It's been the Liberal Democrats and their Davidives saying actually should be taking a [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1798.8799999999999s)]
*  stronger position on Donald Trump as opposed to Kevin Badenock and the Conservatives. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1802.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, which is interesting. OK, nearly there. But one question. Anyone bold enough to make a prediction [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1806.08s)]
*  for the week ahead? Don't be crazy, James. No. It falls to you, Darcini, to make a prediction. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1813.6799999999998s)]
*  I predict we're going to be sitting in these exact same seats in a week's time discussing the [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1820.96s)]
*  exact same issues. This isn't going anywhere. Well, I'm delighted to say Adam will be back to [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1824.96s)]
*  do that. Thank you all very much indeed. Darcini, thank you. Thanks, Alex. Pleasure. Thanks, Katrina. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1829.44s)]
*  Thanks. Talk soon. Yeah, who knows? Who knows what's going to happen next? Whatever happens, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1835.2s)]
*  you can be sure there will be, as Darcini says, a newscast along for you to digest it all very [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1840.56s)]
*  soon. Keep sending us your questions. We will keep answering them or we'll keep trying to answer [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1845.92s)]
*  them anyway. But that's it from this episode of newscast. Bye bye. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWEGpGLURE&t=1850.16s)]
