Video Description: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - in his final week in office - has delivered a punchy response to new tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Canadian goods, calling it “a dumb thing to do”.
 
In a press conference Trudeau said Canada will not back down from a fight," and announced 25% retaliatory tariffs against C$155bn (US$107bn; £84bn) worth of American goods, starting with C$30bn worth of goods immediately.
 
In follow-up questions with reporters, the Canadian Prime Minister accused Trump of wanting to see a "collapse" of the Canadian economy, before reiterating that Canada would never become the 51st US state.
 
US President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada from Monday overnight, and also charged a 10% tariff on Canadian energy.

# Canadian PM Trudeau retaliates against US and calls Trump's tariffs ‘very dumb’ | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg)
*  As promised, let's talk tariffs for the next few minutes because big, big developments [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=0.0s)]
*  on that global story today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=5.92s)]
*  And in the last 30 minutes, you may have seen the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=8.16s)]
*  announce that they are putting together plans to challenge the US tariffs that have been [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=13.56s)]
*  announced at the World Trade Organisation, saying it's a violation of an existing free [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=19.88s)]
*  trade agreement between the countries. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=24.52s)]
*  Trump's tariffs on Mexico, on Canada and China came into effect today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=27.28s)]
*  The tariffs are 25% taxes on goods from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% on Chinese [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  products, bringing that total to 20%. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=40.08s)]
*  The announcement sent US and European stocks sharply down. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, Canada's Prime Minister, talking at that news conference just a short while ago, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=47.8s)]
*  Trudeau slammed the measures as illegal actions, saying Canada will keep its tariffs on US [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=52.4s)]
*  goods in place until America remove theirs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=57.92s)]
*  And the country was also considering other options. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=61.28s)]
*  From expanding EI benefits and making them more flexible to providing direct supports [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  to businesses, we will be there as needed to help. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  But Canada, make no mistake, no matter how long this lasts, no matter what the cost, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  the federal government and other orders of government will be there for you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  We will defend Canadian jobs. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=104.96s)]
*  We will take measures to prevent predatory behaviour that threatens Canadian companies [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=108.04s)]
*  because of the impacts of this trade war, leaving them open to takeovers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=113.68s)]
*  We will relentlessly fight to protect our economy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  We will stand up for Canadians every single second of every single day because this country [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=124.58000000000001s)]
*  is worth fighting for. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=132.12s)]
*  It's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=133.92s)]
*  But Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=137.92s)]
*  thing to do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=145.44s)]
*  Well, let's speak to the former chief economist of the World Trade Organisation, Dr Patrick [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  Lowe. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=152.88s)]
*  And, Doctor, welcome to the programme. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=153.88s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you on. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=155.76s)]
*  It looks like we are in for a sustained trade war here, doesn't it? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  It really does. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=162.92s)]
*  I think the word that Prime Minister Trudeau used is apt. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=163.92s)]
*  The economics of this are really crazy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=167.16s)]
*  He said dumb. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=170.16s)]
*  In terms of consequences globally, just take our viewers through it in terms of likely [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  consequences here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  The first impact will be on prices that the United States has to pay in order to import [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=179.92s)]
*  from Canada, from Mexico and from China. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=189.52s)]
*  And those are not insignificant amounts of trade. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  The immediate effect will be to raise consumer prices. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=197.72s)]
*  Producers in the United States who rely on imports as inputs into their production processes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=202.12s)]
*  will also be affected. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  And then, of course, there's a retaliation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  There's no doubt whatsoever that there's going to be retaliation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  We don't know what Mexico is going to do, but we have a pretty good idea what the Canadians [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=215.2s)]
*  and the Chinese have in mind. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=218.96s)]
*  And it will get ugly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=222.52s)]
*  I'm not sure how this is going to end, but it's going to be very bad for the economy, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  the world economy, because these are big players. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=228.0s)]
*  And when you get into a spiral like that, it is very difficult to actually get out of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=230.88s)]
*  it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=236.04s)]
*  I was looking at a graphic only, what, a month or so ago when this was proposed and then [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=237.04s)]
*  paused. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  But the notion was, if we get into a full global tiff at tariff war in terms of the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  impact it has on GDP, global GDP, it was the combined total of France and Germany. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=249.84s)]
*  I mean, that is staggering, isn't it? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=258.04s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=260.48s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=261.48s)]
*  And clearly there's going to be an economic... [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=262.48s)]
*  If this carries on, if they don't settle this quickly, and I don't think the prospects for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=265.04s)]
*  doing that look great, it's going to hit... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  It's already hitting stock markets and stock prices. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  It's going to hit inflation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=275.0s)]
*  It's going to hit growth. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=276.8s)]
*  It's going to... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=278.56s)]
*  It's just going to make people poorer. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=279.56s)]
*  Maybe a few countries will gain a little bit because of shifting trade patterns, but it'll [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=281.16s)]
*  be minor compared to the damage. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=286.32s)]
*  Already, growth, you mentioned growth already. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=288.6s)]
*  We're looking at this quarter for the US and it's having an impact. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=291.24s)]
*  All the uncertainty of the last six weeks playing into a slashing of the forecast for [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=295.52s)]
*  American growth. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=302.44s)]
*  And of course, we're perhaps just part way down this path, aren't we? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=303.96s)]
*  Because the EU is in Donald Trump's sights next. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=309.24s)]
*  We're going to see what they do to the EU. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=314.12s)]
*  I think it'll be surprising if they don't do the same thing. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  But then, of course, it's just going to multiply by several fold the consequences because Europe's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=320.32s)]
*  a big player. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=326.08s)]
*  In terms of a way out, I know it's very difficult to try and get inside the mind of the American [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=327.52s)]
*  president, but what do you think he's actually hoping to achieve here? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=334.24s)]
*  I think... [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=339.6s)]
*  I'm not sure, honestly, because I do think it's hard to get inside his mind, but from [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=340.6s)]
*  what he's been saying for quite a long time, he thinks that tariffs are a legitimate defence [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=344.24s)]
*  against what he considers to be the systematic exploitation of the United States by all its [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  trading partners. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=353.8s)]
*  Now, on both counts, it's very hard to understand what he's actually talking about because clearly [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=354.8s)]
*  these are simply not the realities. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=360.52s)]
*  He has said in the past that he wants companies to come back to actually produce in America. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=365.72s)]
*  That is a pretty simplistic thing to say. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=374.64s)]
*  How difficult is it to translate into reality? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=377.56s)]
*  Well, first of all, that takes quite a lot of time. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=381.44s)]
*  And secondly, they're going to come into America to do what? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  To service export bases when they have to buy all these inputs at inflated prices. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=387.2s)]
*  It's really hard to see. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, he thinks that the United States needs more manufacturing industry. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's also something that's highly contested, because if you look at the national accounts [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=401.56s)]
*  of the United States, the vast bulk of the United States' earnings, money, the income [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=407.24s)]
*  comes from services, not from manufacturers. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=412.68s)]
*  And that's the reality of rich countries. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=416.32s)]
*  A quick final thought, we've only got a few seconds left. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=418.24s)]
*  We said that Canada's Prime Minister is going to challenge what the Americans have done [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  at the World Trade Organisation. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=425.68s)]
*  Has that got any mileage, do you think, briefly? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=427.84s)]
*  Sadly, I'm afraid it will not have, because the World Trade Organisation is in disrepair [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=430.6s)]
*  to the point where I don't think anything it says or does right now is going to have [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=436.16s)]
*  an impact. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=440.68s)]
*  Perhaps that will get better in the future, but right now it's more of a political gesture [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=441.68s)]
*  than a hope for remedial action. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=446.04s)]
*  Dr Patrick Glow, a really bleak analysis from you, but thank you for your time and your [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=449.52s)]
*  thoughts. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=455.92s)]
*  We have to leave it there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=456.92s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us on the programme. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Bd8aVm5eg&t=458.12s)]
