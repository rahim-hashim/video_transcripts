# Jihadist motivation in Munich attack, German prosecutors say | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k)
*  In Munich, prosecutors say that the man who was accused of driving a car into a crowd of people in the city yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=0.0s)]
*  appears to have had a religious motivation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=7.68s)]
*  During a news conference in the city, the chief state prosecutor, Gabrielle Tillman, said while it was not yet certain, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=10.64s)]
*  it does seem, given what the suspect himself has said, that the incident was an Islamist-motivated attack. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=17.28s)]
*  This is what she said. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=23.04s)]
*  From everything we have seen and read so far, I can comfortably say that we see an Islamist motive. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=24.56s)]
*  What we also want to say is that there is no indication that the suspect was part of an Islamist organisation like ISIS. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=34.56s)]
*  No indication at all. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=41.84s)]
*  Well, police there now say that 36 people were injured in that suspected attack. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=44.32s)]
*  Two of them seriously, one is a child, and we've been speaking to Michael Jager, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=50.0s)]
*  who's a trade union member who was at the rally that was attacked by that vehicle. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  I was near the rear of the march. We were just walking down the street when I heard a loud motor engine revving up, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  followed by a crash. I turned around and I saw dozens of people lying on the ground, injured, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=70.56s)]
*  dozens more, somehow stopping the vehicle with the engine still going. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=78.24s)]
*  I saw many people try to run away, many other people try to run toward the injured people and try to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=88.08s)]
*  administer first aid, and that's what I did as well. A lot of the people who were there realised as to die [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=93.84s)]
*  that this is going to be used by politicians to argue for more strict policies against asylum seekers, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  against refugees, against foreigners. A lot of people felt that this cannot abide, they [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=110.64s)]
*  would not want to be instrumentalised like that, and that's why we organised, still while we were [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  all in shock, a demonstration yesterday evening against this political instrumentation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=126.4s)]
*  I think all of the politicians were doing that. The blood had not dried on the streets when [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=132.96s)]
*  Marco Surrata, Prime Minister of Bereria, was already on scene, spoke like about two sentences [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  about his grief for the victims, for the injured. Luckily no deaths so far. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=147.2s)]
*  Then he almost immediately pivoted to his usual message of we need to be [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  tough on crime, tough on immigrants, we need to send immigrants back to their home countries, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  which is a political messaging that the trade union members, remember trade unions stand for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=170.56s)]
*  solidarity, would not support, and we are shocked and disgusted by this messaging. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2twjc9OtS5k&t=178.39999999999998s)]
