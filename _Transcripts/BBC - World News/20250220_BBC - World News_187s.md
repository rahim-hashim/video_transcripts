Video Description: "The hearts of an entire nation lie in tatters” said Israel's President Isaac Herzog, as the bodies of four hostages taken alive by Hamas in its attack on 7 October 2023 were returned to Tel Aviv.

Hamas said they were the remains of a mother and two children from the Bibas family, whose fate has gripped Israel.  The news that Shiri Bibas and her sons, who would now be aged five and two, were dead triggered an outpouring of grief across the country.  Israel has confirmed the identity of the fourth body - Oded Lifschitz, 84, a veteran peace activist - after a forensic examination.

Hamas claimed in November 2023 that the Bibas family had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. The Israeli government not confirmed the claim.

It is the first time Hamas has returned captives dead since the ceasefire began. Following Hamas's handover of the four bodies, thousands of Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and observed a minute's silence.

*  But Hamas has its own agenda, making it easier for Israelis to watch is not part of it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=40.64s)]
*  16 months on from October the 7th, it all came surging back. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=49.2s)]
*  This was the moment Hamas gunmen forced their way into the Bebas house. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=53.52s)]
*  A mother's terror as she sought to protect her young sons, one of that day's most searing images. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=63.28s)]

*  for formal identification. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  In Hostages Square, where these moments are seen and digested, a wave of grief. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=94.48s)]
*  The Bebas family have come to symbolize the hopes and fears of a nation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=100.0s)]
*  People have been holding their breath for 502 days. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=104.32s)]
*  And we've all seen the video of Shiri Bebas and her two sons being taken away. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=109.84s)]
*  And I think many of us have been trying to kind of bury that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=115.04s)]
*  And now we can't. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=119.44s)]
*  In two days' time, the mood here in Hostages Square will change again, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=121.68s)]
*  as the country prepares to welcome home another six living hostages. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=125.92s)]
*  But the trauma of October the 7th has not faded away. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=130.16s)]
*  And days like today bring it back into sharp, painful focus. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=133.36s)]
*  Back in the wastelands of Gaza, they're also looking for bodies. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  Seventy-two people were killed by an airstrike on this building exactly a year ago. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=146.0s)]
*  It's been too dangerous to come and search before now. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=151.36s)]
*  My two sisters are here, Mustafa says, and my niece and two of my cousins. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=156.72000000000003s)]
*  Five floors came down, one on top of the other. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  We haven't been able to get anyone out. We just want to bury them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=164.4s)]
*  This war's trail of death and suffering is hard to comprehend. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=171.2s)]
*  They can lay the dead to rest, but the war still isn't over. The grief is endless. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=176.56s)]
*  Paul Adams, BBC News, Tel Aviv. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quM5e7ampQY&t=183.68s)]
