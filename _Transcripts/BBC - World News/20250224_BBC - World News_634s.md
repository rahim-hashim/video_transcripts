# How did decision makers react to Russia's invasion of Ukraine? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg)
*  In the last several hours, Russia has invaded Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=0.0s)]
*  I have decided to conduct a special military operation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=11.76s)]
*  This is Paparyk. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=16.6s)]
*  A whole line of traffic for as far as the eye can see trying to get out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=21.28s)]
*  Putin is the aggressor. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=28.2s)]
*  Putin chose this war. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=31.96s)]
*  We remain united to keep pressure mounting on Putin. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=44.44s)]
*  Putin would not have started that war if I were president. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=54.36s)]
*  We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=57.92s)]
*  them with their rare earth and other things. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  Returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=65.16s)]
*  Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=71.28s)]
*  Today I heard, oh well we weren't invited. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  Well you've been there for three years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=80.08s)]
*  You should have ended it three years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=81.6s)]
*  You should have never started it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=83.36s)]
*  You could have made a deal. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=84.6s)]
*  It is unfortunate that President Trump lives in this disinformation space. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move faster, he's not going to have a country [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=90.04s)]
*  level deal. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=95.68s)]
*  European leaders are backing the Ukrainians. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=97.68s)]
*  I'm prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine is a democracy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=105.0s)]
*  Putin's Russia is not. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=106.68s)]
*  If you need me to leave this chair, I'm ready to do that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  And I can also exchange it for NATO membership. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  They take a lot of territory so they have the cards. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=115.32s)]
*  I think I have the power to end this war. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  This week marks three years since Russia launched its full scale invasion of Ukraine and certainly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  in the last couple of weeks how to end the conflict has been brought into sharp focus [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=132.84s)]
*  by conversations between global leaders. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=138.48s)]
*  Here in the UkraineCast studio we've been speaking to James Hepey. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=141.8s)]
*  He was the UK Armed Forces Minister on February 24, 2022 and to Julian Smith who was the US [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  permanent representative to NATO in the Biden administration when the full scale invasion [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=153.52s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  Looking back over the past three years, James, what's the moment that stands out for you? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=160.36s)]
*  The thing that gave you hope, worry, confusion, something you'll remember for the rest of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  your life? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  So there are two. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  There's the flight into Kyiv on that late January night where we knew what was coming. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=180.32s)]
*  We were going in to have a sort of council of war with the Ukrainians and looking out [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=188.44s)]
*  of the window and seeing the sort of five-a-side football pitches all floodlit, full of Ukrainian [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=192.92s)]
*  kids playing football. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=198.2s)]
*  There was a slight oddity to knowing that war was literally two weeks away but they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=200.56s)]
*  were getting on with life but in two weeks' time their lives would change forever. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=205.48s)]
*  That was a strange moment. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  Then secondly, I did a couple of trips down to the various training camps where we were [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=213.11999999999998s)]
*  training Ukrainian men and women to become Ukrainian soldiers in a very short period [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  of time, five, six weeks. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=226.56s)]
*  I hosted a number of world leaders when they came to visit their training contingents but [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  I also hosted my Ukrainian counterpart. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=236.88s)]
*  We stood there and it was on Salisbury Plain and it was late summer, the ground was yellow, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=240.68s)]
*  the sky was blue and we stood there and watched these Ukrainians in full body armour digging [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=246.88s)]
*  trenches learning all the defensive tactics that they were going to need to employ in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=251.76s)]
*  the Donbass. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=255.96s)]
*  Vladimir Haverlov, my counterpart, gathered them and gave them this incredible speech [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=258.96s)]
*  that an interpreter was just interpreting to me in real time. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=263.64s)]
*  At the end, he's a former Major General not prone to emotion but inspirational. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=267.44s)]
*  In fact, he did a lot of stuff at the BBC, he was a great sort of convincer for the Ukrainian [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=275.04s)]
*  cause and at the end he just screamed with just incredible conviction, you know, Slava [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  Ukrainian and the sort of visceral response from these men who were five weeks into their [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  six-week training package and could possibly be just one more week from their deaths and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  the sort of sheer determination was just overwhelming against that backdrop, yellow-gland, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  blue sky, unbelievable and will you see it in my memory for a lifetime. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=304.0s)]
*  It's the usual chant and response, Slava Ukrainian, glory to Ukraine, you're supposed [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=309.92s)]
*  to respond, glory to heroes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=314.92s)]
*  Exactly and you know, it was just, I took men away on operations during my time in the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=316.72s)]
*  British Army but it was much measured, we were away from home, it wasn't existential, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=325.44s)]
*  we sort of wanted to keep each other safe, we wanted to do our best to move the dial [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=330.18s)]
*  in Basra or Sangin or Kabul but this was different, this was men and women who knew that they [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  were going into the meat grinder, they were absolutely clear-eyed on the danger that faced [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=339.32s)]
*  them, they had had five weeks of the best training that we could provide them with, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=343.8s)]
*  they got one more week to go, they were literally stood there in 35 degrees of heat digging [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=347.8s)]
*  trenches genuinely as if their lives depended on it because the next time they would do [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  it their lives really could depend on it and that, just the visceralness in that exchange [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=358.08s)]
*  at the end of Vladimir's speech, you just heard everything you needed to know about [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=364.76s)]
*  the Ukrainian warrior spirit and why all of the tax pounds, the euros, the dollars that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=370.08s)]
*  were being spent around the world were absolutely worth it to give these men and women a chance [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=375.4s)]
*  of getting their country back. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=380.36s)]
*  Do you know how many of them survived? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=381.36s)]
*  I don't but I would imagine given where I know they were going that there will be a [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=383.52s)]
*  fair chunk of them who are now dead or have suffered life-changing injuries as a consequence [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=389.12s)]
*  and that is the grim reality of war, it's ultimately a numbers game but in that moment [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=394.24s)]
*  you sort of, you're aware that that is the fate that awaits an alarmingly large proportion [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=401.96s)]
*  of them and you're just pretty inspired by their determination to go and fight for their [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=407.76s)]
*  country. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=412.28s)]
*  Julie, what about for you, a moment for you personally in the last three years? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=413.28s)]
*  Well I think of two moments as well, I think of mid-January of 2022 before the war started [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=420.11999999999995s)]
*  we had been sharing an unprecedented amount of intelligence with our friends in Ukraine [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=428.23999999999995s)]
*  to warn them about what was coming. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  We had a number of folks in Kiev that still were skeptical that Russia was actually going [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=436.78s)]
*  to start a war with Ukraine but on one evening in mid-January I also received another call [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=442.09999999999997s)]
*  in the middle of the night, I was told that the Ukrainian Foreign Minister was in Brussels [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=449.17999999999995s)]
*  and that he was going to be receiving a very important call from the United States in my [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=454.14s)]
*  office in the middle of the night so we had to find him in his hotel in Brussels, wake [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=459.73999999999995s)]
*  him up, I went to the NATO alliance in the middle of the night, I met him at the front [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=464.86s)]
*  door of the NATO alliance, he had never walked in to the NATO alliance before, it was a very [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=469.26s)]
*  somber moment, we walked in together, I set him up in my office on a secure line and he [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=475.04s)]
*  was told that evening the exact date when we believed that the war would be starting [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=481.3s)]
*  with plenty of evidence as to why we were so certain about that and then a long list [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=486.98s)]
*  of things that the United States was prepared to do to support Ukraine in that moment. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=492.66s)]
*  But I also think of another moment when I got another call late in the evening one night [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=498.02000000000004s)]
*  when at the time we didn't understand but an errant missile from Ukraine actually landed [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  inside Poland and killed two Polish farmers. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=511.08000000000004s)]
*  At the time because the intelligence wasn't absolutely clear in those first few minutes, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=514.7s)]
*  we at NATO and certainly from my perspective we were under the impression that there was [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=520.26s)]
*  a possibility that Russia had actually decided to strike NATO territory, either it had done [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=526.78s)]
*  so accidentally or deliberately, which would obviously change the entire nature of NATO's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=533.6s)]
*  response. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=540.62s)]
*  We were at risk in those first few minutes in my mind of having NATO forced to respond [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=542.02s)]
*  because we would be in new territory. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=549.1400000000001s)]
*  We would be facing an Article 5 contingency at that juncture having had an ally attacked [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=550.86s)]
*  by Russia. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=556.7s)]
*  So as I rushed into the NATO alliance that evening for another emergency North Atlantic [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=557.9000000000001s)]
*  Council meeting around the table, what was going through my mind as my heart was racing [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=562.98s)]
*  was that this was going to be a major turning point. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=567.94s)]
*  Now as it turns out, within a few hours we all understood that this was not a Russian [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=572.4200000000001s)]
*  attack. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=577.62s)]
*  This in fact was an errant missile that was coming from Ukraine, got off course and tragically [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=578.62s)]
*  killed these two Polish citizens. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=584.18s)]
*  But I will never forget the anxiety that that created that evening because of course NATO [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=586.66s)]
*  had made clear that it would not become directly engaged in the war, although it would support [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=592.7s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=598.94s)]
*  We were going to do everything to keep NATO out of it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02hi3gFj1Tg&t=600.04s)]
