# Venezuela protests: 'Four dead' ahead of mass protest - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 23, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg)
*  Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have taken to the streets of the capital, Caracas, in an attempt to topple President Maduro from power. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=0.0s)]
*  He was sworn in for his second term a fortnight ago after elections which were boycotted by the opposition and condemned internationally. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=7.0s)]
*  Disturbances have increased throughout the week with clashes between the police and protesters. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=15.0s)]
*  Supporters of the president have also organised rival demonstrations today and there's a large security presence. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=20.0s)]
*  Let me just show you the live pictures from Caracas because rival demonstrations both for and against the president currently taking place. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=27.0s)]
*  Let's speak to one local journalist, Jornan Maldonado, who is there for us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=35.0s)]
*  And Jornan, just tell us what it is like there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=40.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. Here in Caracas, the environment is pretty shaky right now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=44.0s)]
*  We have the opposition rally that is going in the east of the city. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=51.0s)]
*  Pretty much a big concentration of persons. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=58.0s)]
*  They're about to, they're waiting for their current leader Juan Guaidó. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=61.0s)]
*  And in the west of Caracas, in the midtown Caracas, we have the government concentration. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=66.0s)]
*  It's also waiting for the leader Nicolas Maduro. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=73.0s)]
*  Right now, two nights ago, there have been protests in Caracas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=76.0s)]
*  It has been a pretty shaky night for Caracas. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=81.0s)]
*  In downtown, it hasn't been easy having barricades, fire, confirming police and military over the last two nights. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=86.0s)]
*  So it sounds very tense. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=97.0s)]
*  The opposition want to drive Nicolas Maduro from power. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=100.0s)]
*  How likely is that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=105.0s)]
*  Because when you hear the president, there is absolutely no sign from him that he is going to do anything else than carry out this second term. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=107.0s)]
*  Yeah, opposition is waving their chances. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=116.0s)]
*  They are waving their chances on their national parliament leader, president Juan Guaidó, who is currently waving his chances on article of the Constitution 233, 333 and 350. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=120.0s)]
*  They say that a government that is not elected by a popular vote is not legitimate. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=136.0s)]
*  So they want to make a legitimate government in four steps to stop the usurpation of Nicolas Maduro, according to them, to open a humanitarian channel, to convocate new elections with new authorities, new national electoral councils, and to elect a new president. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=146.0s)]
*  Because Europe is pretty confident in Miraflores Palace right now because they are counting on the military support. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=172.0s)]
*  Jormán, stay there because this obviously has international ramifications. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=182.0s)]
*  And of course, the US vice president has been speaking in the last little while. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=187.0s)]
*  He has produced a video message to Venezuelans, which he released about 24 hours ago, supporting some of those protesters you've been seeing there on the screen. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=192.0s)]
*  Let's just have a look at what Mike Pence actually issued. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=201.0s)]
*  Nicolas Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=204.0s)]
*  He's never won the presidency in a free and fair election. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=209.0s)]
*  The United States supports the courageous decision by Juan Guaidó, the president of your National Assembly, to assert that body's constitutional powers, declare Maduro a usurper and call for the establishment of a transitional government. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=212.0s)]
*  Well, that was Mike Pence in response to that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=229.0s)]
*  President Maduro announced that his government will now revise its relations with the United States. Have a look at this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=232.0s)]
*  I have given the order to the foreign minister of the republic to initiate a total and absolute revision with the government of the United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=242.0s)]
*  In the coming hours, we will take decisions of a political and diplomatic character in defense of our national sovereignty, constitution and democracy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=250.0s)]
*  Well, that was the robust response. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=261.0s)]
*  Let me just tell you sources coming from Washington because it's being reported that Trump administration could recognize the head of Venezuela's opposition as the country's legitimate president. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=263.0s)]
*  That is just emerging in Washington. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=273.0s)]
*  I'll keep an eye on that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=275.0s)]
*  That's the Reuters news agency just reporting that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=276.0s)]
*  So that is an interesting line adding to what we heard there from Mike Pence. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=279.0s)]
*  Let's go back to Caracas. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=283.0s)]
*  A quick final thought from your man, Maldano. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=285.0s)]
*  In terms of the international pressure principally from the United States, how important is that going to be, do you think? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=288.0s)]
*  You know, the international pressure has been a pretty important support for the opposition who are counting on the group of Lima and the recent statement from the US government. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=296.0s)]
*  Nicolas Maduro and his government have been checking on their diplomatic relationship with the US government. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=313.0s)]
*  Just last night, Nicolas Maduro reacted to that and said that he ordered the foreign minister to check on their relationship with the United States. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=323.0s)]
*  So it's a pretty tense game right now, but I think we are about to know what's going to happen today. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=336.0s)]
*  Well, your man, Maldano, thanks so much for joining us there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=343.0s)]
*  It is clearly very, very busy with tens of thousands on the streets, both for and against. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=347.0s)]
*  Thanks for giving us that snapshot on the ground. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=352.0s)]
*  And obviously, as those crowds build, we will continue to watch the scene there in Venezuela and bring you any more. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TytNU6hsg&t=356.0s)]
