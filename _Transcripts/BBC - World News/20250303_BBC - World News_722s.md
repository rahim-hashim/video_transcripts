Video Description: With its dancing challenges and comedy sketches, it’s no surprise why TikTok is popular with young Kenyans.
 
It’s also a way for them to make money through the app’s gifting service.
 
But there’s a darker side, where young women – and girls as young as 15 – are selling sexual content on livestreams, with some being recruited by "digital pimps".
 
BBC Africa Eye has investigated the sexual exploitation of girls and who is profiting.
 
TikTok has said it has "zero tolerance for exploitation".

# TikTok profiting from sexual livestreams involving children, BBC told | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M)
*  I sell myself on TikTok. I dance naked, live. I do that because that's where I can earn [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=0.0s)]
*  money to support myself. My name is Debula Kemoli and I'm investigating the grooming [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=12.8s)]
*  and sexual exploitation of girls in some of the most deprived neighborhoods of Nairobi. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=24.46s)]
*  Girls as young as 15 say they've been targeted and raped by predators on social media. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=31.18s)]
*  TikTok is the world's fastest growing social media platform with more than one and a half [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=51.26s)]
*  billion users worldwide and it's massive in Kenya. Half of all Kenyans now use the app. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=56.22s)]
*  TikTok is also a source of money in a country where two-thirds of young people are out of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=64.44s)]
*  work. During the day users post light content including dance challenges, makeup tutorials [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=68.94s)]
*  and sell their products. Payment takes place on TikTok via emoji gifts which can be converted [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=75.58s)]
*  into cash. But at night there's a darker side to TikTok. Live streams like this where women [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=82.22s)]
*  are selling sex and I've also been told that children are being targeted by so-called digital [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  pimps. Men who are grooming girls online and selling them for sex. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=97.1s)]
*  In Kenya the age of consent is 18. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=106.46s)]
*  I've come to Majengo, a poor neighborhood in Nairobi, to meet a girl who describes how she was groomed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=113.9s)]
*  and raped by men she met through TikTok. She was just 15 at the time. I sell myself on TikTok. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=120.14s)]
*  I dance naked, live. I do that because that's where I can earn money to support myself. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  As nudity and sexual acts are more likely to be removed by TikTok's content moderation, explicitly [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=138.94s)]
*  sexual videos were shared on another platform. When you're dancing live some people will contact [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=145.26000000000002s)]
*  you and then you will take the conversation offline and then you meet them and sleep with them [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=152.54s)]
*  and then I get some money from that. It was through her older friend's account that she was [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=160.7s)]
*  able to get onto TikTok, the same friend who introduced her to a digital pimp. If you do this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=167.5s)]
*  then he tells you he will meet you. After you sleep with him he says okay, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=175.74s)]
*  let me think about it. He will get a message through my brother. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=183.34s)]
*  The brother will then tell you if you got the job or not. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  I told him I was 15 years old. He said it is okay and he loves young girls below 18 and he gives them work. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=192.38s)]
*  Fihartisha, any money she made on TikTok with her pimp was promising to bring her thousands of followers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=205.74s)]
*  TikTok would also be taking a cut. More than 70% of gifts sent on the platform. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=212.22s)]
*  Let's say you get 3,000. You have to split it down the middle because he's there and he's following you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  You don't know what he's thinking. You don't know what he's thinking. You don't know what he's thinking. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=227.18s)]
*  You don't know what he's thinking. You don't know what he's thinking. You don't know what he's thinking. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  You don't know what he's thinking. You don't know if he will send someone. And you don't know what will happen to you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=239.5s)]
*  When I get a lion he converts it to cash and takes his share. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  I started doing TikTok. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=257.18s)]
*  I started doing things with him before we met face to face. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=260.18s)]
*  No. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=280.18s)]
*  The results of all this have caused lasting psychological damage. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=287.18s)]
*  We have to look for money from people who offer them sexual whatever. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=317.18s)]
*  We call it sex-torsion. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=324.18s)]
*  Another young woman has agreed to talk to us anonymously. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=326.18s)]
*  We are calling her Jay. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=330.18s)]
*  Shortly after joining TikTok at 16 years old, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=332.18s)]
*  Jay says she was introduced to one of these so-called digital pimps. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=336.18s)]
*  He started by asking me to send him my naked pictures. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=341.18s)]
*  He told me that if I sent him my pictures, he would pay me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=346.18s)]
*  Because I was desperate, I decided to do it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=352.18s)]
*  I met him and he asked me to have sex with him and we had sex. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=357.18s)]
*  She says when she decided to get away and report him, things took a sinister turn. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=363.18s)]
*  Later, I threatened him on the phone that I would report him on what he has done to me. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=369.18s)]
*  He laughed and said that I can't report him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=375.18s)]
*  He does not live in Kenya. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=379.18s)]
*  He kept saying he will see who is the strongest. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=381.18s)]
*  When I heard that, I threw away my phone. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=385.18s)]
*  By now, she had cut off all contact but was suspicious that she was being followed. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=391.18s)]
*  I went to town to sell myself. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=399.18s)]
*  I was a woman. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=402.18s)]
*  I saw two men behind me. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=404.18s)]
*  I thought these are the same people I left at the bus stop. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=407.18s)]
*  If I move, they move. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=412.18s)]
*  She is now in hiding, moving from place to place and living in fear. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=416.18s)]
*  The caregivers and parents have been living in fear for a long time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=424.18s)]
*  The caregivers and parents have very little knowledge on how to protect children from being exploited or abused online. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=431.18s)]
*  Of course, TikTok, because of the ease in which you can access it, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=441.18s)]
*  I think there is a much higher probability for these perpetrators to see young girls dancing nicely and getting in touch with these girls. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=447.18s)]
*  But I want to emphasize that it's across all social media, Instagram, X, Facebook. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=460.18s)]
*  All this content is controlled under TikTok. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=471.18s)]
*  This is not allowed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=474.18s)]
*  TikTok Live was recently introduced in Kenya, requiring more content moderation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=477.18s)]
*  This month, it works for a company called Teleperformance in Nairobi, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=482.18s)]
*  who are contracted by TikTok to flag up and remove banned content. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=486.18s)]
*  He says it's almost impossible to keep up with the amount of content being shared. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=491.18s)]
*  The number of videos on TikTok compared to the number of moderating is incomparable. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=499.18s)]
*  Yeah, there is a huge distance and the artificial intelligence is not perfect. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=505.18s)]
*  So this job requires the employment of a lot of people. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=512.18s)]
*  What we've got is not enough. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=517.18s)]
*  We've been going on TikTok lives and we've seen sexually explicit content and people advertising sexual services. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=520.18s)]
*  There's young people who go on TikTok, teenagers, and they're able to see this kind of content. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=528.18s)]
*  Why is it still able to get to the public? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=534.18s)]
*  TikTok Live was introduced recently here in Kenya. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=539.18s)]
*  And those moderators, they're working during normal day hours. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=542.18s)]
*  They're working from 9 to 6 to moderate live content. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=547.18s)]
*  I think they've started now covering night times. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=552.18s)]
*  But moderation should never stop 24-7. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=555.18s)]
*  But actually, live content, which is sexual in nature, tend to appear at night times. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=559.18s)]
*  I've come to meet Farida, who helps to rescue girls who have been sexually abused. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=569.18s)]
*  I've come to meet Farida, who helps to rescue girls who have been sexually abused. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=577.18s)]
*  People are now paying attention to the content of the content. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=582.18s)]
*  Because there's no way to stop it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=587.18s)]
*  The content is being shared. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=589.18s)]
*  The NEOP has been working on TikTok. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=591.18s)]
*  And the kids have started to look for other ways to do things. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=594.18s)]
*  They've closed the doors. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=601.18s)]
*  So these people are there. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=603.18s)]
*  Because they know that they can't get kids. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=605.18s)]
*  Because the public doesn't like to see their parents being abused. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=610.18s)]
*  The parents are very angry with their parents. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=614.18s)]
*  But if I go live and show my family and the whole body, I'll get money. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=619.18s)]
*  I'm happy to see the implementation of these laws. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=649.18s)]
*  A 2021 study by the International Charity for Ending Child Prostitution [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=655.18s)]
*  found that two-thirds of Kenyan kids had access to the internet, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=660.18s)]
*  making them especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=665.18s)]
*  And although the Kenyan government is considering stricter regulations for TikTok, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=669.18s)]
*  it has rejected an outright ban. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=675.18s)]
*  The government has been working on this for a long time. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=679.18s)]
*  And it's not just about the content. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=682.18s)]
*  It's about the content of the content. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i90y7Zh0z-M&t=684.18s)]
