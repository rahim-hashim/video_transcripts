**BBC - World News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo)
*  Now, Sir Keir Starmer is in Washington, D.C., ahead of his first meeting with U.S. President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump in the White House later. The Prime Minister has already reiterated his call for [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=5.34s)]
*  a U.S. security guarantee as part of any peace deal in Ukraine. Donald Trump says it should [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=10.1s)]
*  be Europe, not the United States, that should be responsible for Ukraine's security. Sir [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  Keir Starmer says that he wants to strike a new partnership with the U.S., calling Mr. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=21.82s)]
*  Trump a friend of the U.K. Our political editor Chris Mason is following the visit. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=26.48s)]
*  Well hello from Washington. You know, we've only been here a couple of hours and already [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=32.2s)]
*  we've been to the British Embassy. Why? Well, the Prime Minister headed straight there from [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=35.6s)]
*  the plane to be greeted by someone you might just recognise, Lord Mandelson, the new ambassador [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=39.8s)]
*  here, Foreign Secretary David Lammy was there too, why they wanted to woo members of the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=45.64s)]
*  A. Trump administration who had been invited to a drinks reception. And take a look at [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=51.8s)]
*  this, this is diplomacy in action. The Prime Minister, a Labour Prime Minister, saying [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=56.8s)]
*  he reckons he's got something in common with Elon Musk, the billionaire working for Donald [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  Trump who just recently was handed a chainsaw to try and demonstrate his ruthlessness at [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=66.32s)]
*  cutting through bureaucracy. We want to strike a new partnership. We share the view that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=73.0s)]
*  our best days lie ahead and, you know, taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style, but we [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=78.96s)]
*  are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy. Let's hear next then from Lord Mandelson, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=89.24s)]
*  who was making the case that the U.K. and the U.S. have always been super close and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=94.72s)]
*  should continue working really closely. I wouldn't say that we are being encircled [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  by our adversaries, we're certainly not, but they're doing a little bit of ganging up and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  that's what's going to need us to be working hand in glove, shoulder to shoulder, even [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=111.6s)]
*  more than we do usually. And we're going to be doing it at a time when you have a leader [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  in this country, in the President, who in my view is going to be a very consequential [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  president for this country indeed. So that big meeting for the Prime Minister with the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  President just a few hours away now, Ukraine, the Middle East, trade, artificial intelligence, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=139.04s)]
*  so much on the agenda and a huge amount at stake. Chris Mason for us there. Our North [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=146.72s)]
*  America correspondent, Merlin Thomas, explain more about Sir Keir Starmer's message for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=153.48s)]
*  President Trump. We heard that Sir Keir Starmer called President Donald Trump a close friend [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=158.0s)]
*  and said that no relationship was more important than with the U.S., the relationship between [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=164.48s)]
*  the U.K. and the U.S., that very special relationship that has been so far emphasized between the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=169.8s)]
*  two countries for so many years. And this line that you heard that Sir Keir Starmer [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=175.72s)]
*  said that actually he is stripping away red tape and bureaucracy is almost a plea to the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=182.04s)]
*  Trump administration that actually we have a lot more in common than you think. We have, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  we know we're coming to closer ground with you. And so Sir Keir Starmer is saying, you [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=193.88s)]
*  know, we've cut back on foreign aid, we are upping our defense spending, and those are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=200.0s)]
*  two things that he will be able to use as leverage and things that he will say to Sir [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=204.64s)]
*  Keir Starmer as a plea to say, actually, you know, we can meet halfway on this and hopefully [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=209.0s)]
*  for Starmer, he'll be looking to make a deal. Sir Keir Starmer's meeting really comes at a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=214.52s)]
*  quite critical juncture for both the U.K. and also Europe's relationship with the U.S. because [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=219.8s)]
*  he sort of sandwiched in between two meetings. So earlier this week, we saw President Macron [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=225.24s)]
*  visit the White House and the photos that we saw were very chummy. The two leaders, President [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=229.52s)]
*  Macron and President Trump, were very flattering towards each other. And then we'll see later [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=236.28s)]
*  this week, we're expecting to see the Ukrainian president, President Zelensky, arrive in the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=242.16s)]
*  White House as well. That's expected to take place on Friday, according to President Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=248.52s)]
*  And that's with regards to the mineral resources deal that is being worked on and negotiated. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=252.98s)]
*  And we're still yet to see the actual details of that. And so Sir Keir Starmer's visit really [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=258.88s)]
*  comes in between those two things. And so will he be able to capitalize on what President [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=263.24s)]
*  Macron has already done in terms of relationships between the U.S. and Europe? And will he be [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=267.68s)]
*  able to have any sway on what happens with the U.S. security guarantees in Ukraine? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=273.2s)]
*  Really, Sir Keir Starmer is trying to reclaim a role in the world order that President Trump [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=278.56s)]
*  really seems to continuously be upending. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzj71Gd0Bo&t=284.59999999999997s)]
