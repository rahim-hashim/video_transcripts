# China says it 'won't back down from Trump's tariff war'. #China #DonaldTrump
**BBC - World News:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8)
*  The Chinese government is standing firm, saying it won't back down to Donald Trump even in the face of more US tariffs on Chinese goods. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  And the message to the population is, don't worry, we can ride this out because the Chinese economy is strong. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=8.08s)]
*  Down here at street level for consumers, it's all about price. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  For them, if gadgets from the US coming in here become more expensive, thought a switch to local brands. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Now, naturally, if you're a Chinese company selling into the US, you are hurting right now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=23.76s)]
*  And we have seen some reports. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=28.96s)]
*  The bosses are saying to their staff, perhaps now is a good time for you to be taking some leave without pay as we ratchet down production. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=31.48s)]
*  But for China, they're saying, why should the rest of the world feel grateful? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=39.0s)]
*  Because Donald Trump is just winding back some of the chaos that he caused in the first place. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  And because we're seeing no negotiations at the moment between Beijing and Washington, China is just digging in. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4B_j-PcvJ8&t=47.160000000000004s)]
