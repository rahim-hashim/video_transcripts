Video Description: Nord Stream 2 is the name of the undersea pipeline that should soon pump more Russian gas into Europe.
It is a divisive project within Europe and has infuriated the US, which fears that more Russian gas means more Russian influence and less share of the lucrative European gas market for American liquefied natural gas.
BBCâ€™s Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill has been looking at the issue.

# Gas wars: The problem with Nord Stream 2 - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA)
*  The relationship between Germany and the United States has been turbulent since Donald Trump came to power. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=0.0s)]
*  I think it's a horrible thing that Germany's doing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=7.4s)]
*  He's attacked Germany's trade surplus, its NATO contributions, and now there's another source of contention. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=9.8s)]
*  It's a horrible thing that you have a pipeline coming from Russia. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=15.92s)]
*  Germany is a captive of Russia. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=19.96s)]
*  Under the Baltic Sea, engineers are already laying a pipeline. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=22.08s)]
*  It'll bring more Russian gas and, some fear, more Russian influence into Europe. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  There's already a pipeline in place, Nord Stream 1. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Nord Stream 2 will run alongside it, from Kingisep in Russia to Greifswald in Germany, doubling its capacity. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=41.0s)]
*  This is where that pipeline, Russian gas, is due to arrive on European soil. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=53.08s)]
*  It's still a building site, but it's also become a political battleground. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=60.28s)]
*  This is the valve that shuts the gas on or off. There's one at the Russian end too. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=65.48s)]
*  Right now, a lot of Europe's gas is piped in via Ukraine, which Russia pays as a transit country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's worried that once Nord Stream 2 is complete, Russia will mothball its pipeline. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=92.28s)]
*  There's still a lot to do, but they reckon they'll get all of this finished by the end of the year. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=98.28s)]
*  There is still, though, opposition from within the EU, and America isn't giving up either. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=102.28s)]
*  They're still threatening sanctions on the Western companies involved in this project. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=106.88s)]
*  What we are concerned about is increased influence from Russia at this time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=111.68s)]
*  Isn't the truth that America would like to have that kind of influence by selling liquefied natural gas to Europe? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=117.16s)]
*  Look, the fact is that the Americans try to sell everything to everybody all of the time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=124.16s)]
*  That's capitalism. That's what we do. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=129.16s)]
*  So why object when Russia just tries to do the same? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=131.56s)]
*  Well, let me finish my point. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=133.76s)]
*  We've been consistently against this project even before we had the ability to sell LNG. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=134.96s)]
*  No-one knows for sure how much gas Europe will demand in the coming years, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=143.16s)]
*  but as countries scramble to supply and secure it, its political value is rising. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOkPZBJHPLA&t=147.16s)]
