# Two dead after car drives into crowd in German city of Mannheim | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs)
*  Officials in Germany say two people have been killed in the city of Mannheim after a car drove into a crowd of people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=0.0s)]
*  There are reports that as many as 25 people were injured in the incident. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=8.0s)]
*  This was the scene in the moments after it happened. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=12.0s)]
*  Police say they have arrested one suspect, a 40-year-old German man. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=15.0s)]
*  And in the last few minutes they've given a further update saying they'd found no immediate political motive behind the crash. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=19.0s)]
*  Mannheim is located in the west of Germany between Stuttgart and Frankfurt. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=27.0s)]
*  The incident happened as crowds gathered in cities across the west of the country for parades to mark the carnival season. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=32.0s)]
*  Richard Irving Braun from the BBC Verify team has been taking a closer look at what happened. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=40.0s)]
*  When there's an event like this, it can take a while for news cameras to get to the scene. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=46.0s)]
*  So what we try to do is piece together the story from videos like this one taken and posted by the public on social media. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=50.0s)]
*  This shows multiple emergency vehicles and was filmed here at this point in Mannheim. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=57.0s)]
*  Let me call it up. It'll be there on the eastermost side of the centre. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=63.0s)]
*  Now these videos all from the aftermath of the incident. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=68.0s)]
*  And it's an incident that seems to have mostly played out along the main route through the centre of Mannheim. It's called Planken. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=71.0s)]
*  So further along this road we've seen what looks like a person lying on the ground being treated by others at this point. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=77.0s)]
*  Then here at the northeast corner of Paradeplatz in the heart of Mannheim is where we saw this video of people running and screaming. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=84.0s)]
*  And a few metres away, just about there in the next video, is where we see abandoned shopping and an abandoned shoe. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=92.0s)]
*  Then at the western end of our map is where we've seen a dark hatchback car damaged, although we don't know whether this car was involved in the incident. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=101.0s)]
*  And then a police vehicle in what looked like several security personnel running toward the water's edge, the Verbin Dungs Canal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=111.0s)]
*  Now we'll bring you more as we get it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wf2MmxnKs&t=119.0s)]
