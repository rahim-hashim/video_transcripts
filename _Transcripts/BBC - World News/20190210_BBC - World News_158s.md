# The three witches of Instagram  - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 10, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY)
*  The same as people talk about yoga, people will be able to just talk about their witchcraft practice. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=0.0s)]
*  I can be sat in my garden with my pendulum, you know what I mean, asking questions. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=6.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it will just become something that's completely normal, hopefully. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=9.0s)]
*  Someone who's a witch is someone who just practices witchcraft and magic. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=16.0s)]
*  They're doing things like spell work, anything for prosperity, healing, whatever they want to do. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=19.0s)]
*  It's someone that's in tune with the elements around them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=23.0s)]
*  Honestly, someone that just practices witchcraft, it's so open. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=27.0s)]
*  And also putting lots of stuff in tiny jars, which is great. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=29.0s)]
*  The most magical times I've had is just me in a room with a candle. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=38.0s)]
*  You feel like time stops when you're practicing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=40.0s)]
*  I use all sorts of things. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=43.0s)]
*  I tend to do spells and little satchels. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=45.0s)]
*  I like to do a lot of spoken magic and scrying with crystal balls and things like that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=48.0s)]
*  It's something that gives me that faith and hope and that connection to spirit and nature. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=53.0s)]
*  Tarot card readings. I use crystals a lot. Meditating. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=59.0s)]
*  My pendulum is probably my favourite. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=63.0s)]
*  If I'm having a hard day and then I go home and I practice, it does calm me down. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=65.0s)]
*  And it does, it makes me have a much nicer outlook on the world. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=69.0s)]
*  It was very much hush-hush, very much unseen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=76.0s)]
*  But now, with things like social media, it's massive, it's huge. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=79.0s)]
*  A lot of the stereotypes do creep in there in some aspects, but it's not fire and brimstone. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=83.0s)]
*  And you're gathered around like a cauldron. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=89.0s)]
*  Because there are so many people putting their practice out there now, especially on Instagram, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=95.0s)]
*  people are more accepting of it, like this generation especially. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=99.0s)]
*  It can be there for anybody. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=102.0s)]
*  People are really out and proud in terms of their witchiness. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=104.0s)]
*  In this kind of world where everything is so stressful, I think it's something for people to turn to. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=110.0s)]
*  And the fact that it's something you can just practice at home, you can just do it in your room. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=116.0s)]
*  The kind of ease of it is really what's made it. Boom. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=120.0s)]
*  There's their phrase, coming out of the broom closet. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=128.0s)]
*  It's very 50-50 on how people will react to it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=131.0s)]
*  Some people are very open to the idea and they'll accept it straight away. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=134.0s)]
*  But some people have this idea that it's quite a satanic thing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=138.0s)]
*  Witchcraft is going to be a practice that's going to be really accessible to a lot of people. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=145.0s)]
*  Don't worry too much if something doesn't make sense. Just follow your intuition. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=148.0s)]
*  It's very natural in nature and it's love. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX6yxOP7xY&t=152.0s)]
