Video Description: A remote Russian region has declared a state of emergency over the appearance of dozens of polar bears in several towns and villages in the Arctic.
Footage from the Novaya Zemlya archipelago shows the animals roaming through building and exploring populated areas.
We ask the experts why this is happening, and find out what can be done to protect humans and bears alike.

# Invasion of the polar bears - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg)
*  This is quite unusual behaviour for polar bears. It has happened in the past where polar bears [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=0.0s)]
*  essentially go to villages to search out food. They look for bins and they scavenge and obviously [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=18.84s)]
*  there's livestock and pets as well. The sea ice is melting earlier in the year and refreezing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=23.8s)]
*  later. They can't get out onto the sea ice to hunt the seals so they're attracted into the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=33.68s)]
*  communities by the smell of food and also by the smell of rubbish, of waste stumps. It's becoming [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=38.52s)]
*  increasingly common right across the arc to incidences of human polar bear conflict. Polar [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  bears tend to live quite solitary lives so to find them in big congregations is really [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=50.4s)]
*  unusual. Bears don't tend to hunt humans, we're not their natural source of prey, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=54.64s)]
*  livestock may be. The thing is, is once bears get really really hungry they'll eventually start [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=58.92s)]
*  picking off people. For people who live in the Arctic communities, if their family or their [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=64.24s)]
*  property is at risk the most likely thing they will do would be to shoot those polar bears. We [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=68.56s)]
*  want to ensure that's not going to happen. We're equipping local people and local communities with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=72.76s)]
*  the tools that they need to try and drive these polar bears out of their communities using non-lethal [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  techniques. Crackers, sirens and alarms, anything that will drive the polar bears away from the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  communities. Errant polar bears coming into communities are trapped, they're locked away in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=89.08s)]
*  the jail and that helps them to associate coming into contact with human beings as a bad experience [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=98.4s)]
*  and they're relocated hundreds of kilometres away by helicopter. This involves infrared sensors so [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=103.76s)]
*  they can identify an animal at a species level and purely by its shape and they can also tell [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  you about the direction of travel of that particular animal. Polar bear patrols can then go out and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  chase that bear away before it puts children and other villagers at risk. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBJKam2nmg&t=124.28s)]
