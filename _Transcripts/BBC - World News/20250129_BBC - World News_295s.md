Video Description: US Judge Loren AliKhan temporarily halted President Donald Trump's order to freeze hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and loans, just minutes before it was set to come into effect on Tuesday.
 
The judge’s order was in response to a lawsuit filed by a group of organisations representing grant recipients, which claims the White House's temporary freezing of already approved funding violates the law.
 
The acting head of the White House budget office had instructed agencies to "temporarily pause all activities related to obligations or disbursement of all federal financial assistance".
 
But the White House directive could have impacted billions of dollars meant for federal programmes, from disaster relief to cancer research.
 
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt had said the pause in funding would allow governments to cut back spending for "woke" gender issues and diversity programmes.

# Donald Trump’s spending freeze blocked by US judge | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY)
*  Meanwhile, in the United States, a judge has blocked a government freeze on federal loans, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=0.0s)]
*  grants and other assistance. The pause was due to come into effect on Tuesday and would [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=5.72s)]
*  have put trillions of dollars on hold. The freeze was challenged by a group of non-governmental [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=10.6s)]
*  organisations and some Democrat-run states are also planning legal action. The White [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=15.8s)]
*  House said the pause was intended to bring spending into line with President Trump's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  anti-woke executive orders, but direct payments to individuals like Social Security benefits [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=25.32s)]
*  would continue. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=31.04s)]
*  So what does this pause mean? It means no more funding for illegal DEI programmes. It [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=33.04s)]
*  means no more funding for the Green New scam that has cost American taxpayers tens of billions [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=37.56s)]
*  of dollars. It means no more funding for transgenderism and wokeness across our federal bureaucracy [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=44.04s)]
*  and agencies. No more funding for Green New Deal social engineering policies. Again, people [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=51.22s)]
*  who are receiving individual assistance, you will continue to receive that. And President [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=55.98s)]
*  Trump is looking out for you by issuing this pause because he is being good steward of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  your taxpayer dollars. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=65.08s)]
*  Well that's what the White House has to say about it. Let's now speak to expert on US [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=67.42s)]
*  and UK security, Professor of International Politics at Birmingham University, David Dunn. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=71.78s)]
*  David, welcome. It's all happening at breakneck speed, isn't it, in terms of the appointments [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  and also these rolling out of executive orders. Where are we in the Trump agenda? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=82.42s)]
*  What we are is him absolutely trying to both set the pace of the policy agenda, but also [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=88.62s)]
*  exerting his authority as the, not just the first one equals in the government of America, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=94.86000000000001s)]
*  but actually the person who dictates every aspect. So this executive order yesterday [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=102.02s)]
*  to actually try and freeze funding was an attempt to actually show that he was in charge [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=107.94s)]
*  rather than actually Congress. Congress has passed all these laws over the years that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  funds this trillion dollars worth of public programs, 260 different federal ways of spending [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=118.9s)]
*  money on different aspects of provision for the American people. And what he was saying [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=126.14s)]
*  is I have the authority to stop that. And he tried that and of course he was challenging [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=130.46s)]
*  the courts. But it's performative politics. This is a thing that plays well for his base [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=135.1s)]
*  and also actually is a way of trying to get his tax cuts funded because what Trump wants [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=139.74s)]
*  to do is to actually fund four trillion dollars worth of tax cuts and he needs to find a way [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=144.46s)]
*  of doing that. And part of that is by cutting these programs across schools, hospitals, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=149.62s)]
*  non-profits, forestry projects, water projects and the like. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=155.34s)]
*  But from his perspective it appears that Congress and the Senate and for that matter judges [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=159.74s)]
*  have significant power to throw a spanner in the works. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this is what he's about. So executive orders are instructions to the different departments [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=167.46s)]
*  of state in America to do things. But he can't contradict American laws, but he's trying [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=173.5s)]
*  to do that. But what it requires is for people to take lawsuits saying your executive orders [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=180.94s)]
*  are illegal and therefore I challenge you. So it's a question of a power contest in Washington [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=186.45999999999998s)]
*  as to who has the ability to direct the government to do things. And Trump is pushing his luck [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=193.82s)]
*  really by actually trying to actually extend the role of the presidency into these areas [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=199.42s)]
*  and saying I have the authority to stop these projects because I'm in charge of the executive [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=204.22s)]
*  branch and Congress and the states have to come back and say no you haven't, we will [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=207.98s)]
*  challenge you in the courts. So we can expect much more of this, much more of this to and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=212.42s)]
*  for, much more conflict over the way in which America is governed and who ultimately has [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  responsibility for all these federal programs. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=222.06s)]
*  But in terms of inside the administration, would you say that it is looking as expected [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=225.17999999999998s)]
*  much more cohesive than last time around? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=230.45999999999998s)]
*  Well certainly Trump has been much more prepared than last time around. If you go back eight [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  years ago he was still floundering to find people. This time he's actually been much more [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  prepared. Things like project 2025 have lined up the policy issue agendas and he's lined up to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  the people he wants to get through Congress. And he has so far got his controversial picks [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=250.01999999999998s)]
*  through the Senate. People like Pete Heskett, the new chief of the Pentagon, someone who lacks [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=255.54s)]
*  experience and is a very controversial character, has been approved. And this week we'll see [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=260.38s)]
*  R.F.K. Junior come up for confirmation by the Senate and he has put a huge amount of pressure on [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  senators to approve his picks and threatened them with being primaried with Elon Musk's money if [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=271.7s)]
*  they refuse to support his agenda. So he's showing his total control of the Republican [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=277.14s)]
*  Party, his ability to get things through Congress and his ability to actually move forward on a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=281.66s)]
*  whole variety of policy initiatives with a whole bunch of radical disruptors as his cabinet picks [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=286.42s)]
*  in order to achieve those goals. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=291.94s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTHUd4QKttY&t=293.5s)]
