Video Description: US stocks have rallied after days of turmoil, with European and Asian markets also stabilising.

White House Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called Beijing's response to US tariffs a "big mistake", after China said it will "fight to the end".

It comes after US President Trump threatened to hit Beijing with an extra 50% tariff if it doesn't withdraw its 34% retaliatory levy by the end of the day.

**BBC - World News:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68)
*  Let's start with all the tariff chaos because China says it will fight to the end after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump threatened to increase tariffs on Beijing even further. Donald Trump has [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=5.0s)]
*  said that if China doesn't remove the 34% tariffs it's threatened, in response to his [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=10.0s)]
*  earlier tariffs, he would impose a further 50% tax. That would see Chinese imports into [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=15.32s)]
*  the US facing a total tariff of 104%. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=21.62s)]
*  Well that's the opening bell. It comes with the backdrop where we are a day away from [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=26.0s)]
*  the country specific tariffs coming into effect. In Europe and Asia the stock markets have [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=34.32s)]
*  made gains but are still well down after last week's announcement and days of market turmoil. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=39.88s)]
*  Well Donald Trump's trade representative is still being questioned on Capitol Hill. On [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  the tariff policy, Jameson Greer defended the President's policy and told Senators [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=50.72s)]
*  that almost 50 countries had reached out to make a deal. Well let's hear more of what [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=55.7s)]
*  has been said in that cross-examination because Senator Ron Wyden asked if the tariffs will [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=62.220000000000006s)]
*  go into effect tomorrow as previously announced. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=67.58s)]
*  Yes, they're scheduled to go into effect. We are having negotiations with all kinds [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=70.7s)]
*  of countries at this time. The President's fixed on his purpose. The nature of the emergency [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  that I discussed earlier is not something we can wait on anymore. So we will have the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=82.7s)]
*  President's plan go into effect and we're coupling that with immediate negotiations [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=86.34s)]
*  with our partners as they seek to. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=89.7s)]
*  So it's not a question of something being scheduled. You're committing this morning [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=90.86s)]
*  that they're going to go into effect. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  This is what the President has said, Senator. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=98.14s)]
*  For how many countries? I understand it's over 50. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=99.7s)]
*  That are negotiating with us. We have about 50 that have come to speak with us and I'm [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=103.48s)]
*  constantly talking to my counterparts. I have staff right now at USTR meeting with others [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  and we will have the tariffs in place and if the other countries can come to an agreement [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=114.7s)]
*  on reciprocal trade then that's something the President can consider. I don't want [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=119.36s)]
*  to prejudge the negotiations or the President's decision but that's what we're doing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  Well just some of the key exchanges. Let me tell you that session is still continuing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. We'll continue to monitor what is happening and bring you anything that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=130.06s)]
*  is important in the questions and answers. But whilst that has been going on, speaking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=135.06s)]
*  to Parliament's Liaison Committee here in London, the UK's Prime Minister has said [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  we need to keep our options on the table when responding to the US trade tariffs. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=145.78s)]
*  I'm very obviously very disappointed to see tariffs in place. I don't think that they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=151.94s)]
*  are good for our economy or for economies around the world. My instinct is that we shouldn't [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=158.54s)]
*  jump in with both feet to retaliate so in that sense I'm not changing my plans. I think [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=167.06s)]
*  calm collected response. Obviously we have to keep our options on the table and do the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  preparatory work for retaliation if necessary. But I think that trying to negotiate an arrangement [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=177.34s)]
*  which mitigates the tariffs is better. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=185.34s)]
*  Well let's speak to our political correspondent, Hannah Miller, who's been listening to that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=188.9s)]
*  exchange and a lot of questions obviously on tariffs and other areas. But tell me more [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=193.7s)]
*  of the sorts of questions and answers put to the UK Prime Minister and more of his thinking [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=199.46s)]
*  here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=205.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean on tariffs in particular, Matthew, he said that he was disappointed to see them [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=205.62s)]
*  described the last few days as very challenging as well as the clip that you just heard of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=212.86s)]
*  Keir Starmer there. He was asked whether there might be any support for British businesses [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=218.34s)]
*  along the lines of the support that was given during the Covid pandemic. And I mean essentially [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=224.0s)]
*  the answer to that was no, not in that kind of form, although it was very clear from the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=231.0s)]
*  speech that he gave yesterday that the way the government is thinking here is about [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=237.02s)]
*  kind of shaping British industrial strategy and trying to support certain sectors to boost [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=241.94s)]
*  jobs and sort of accepting that these tariffs are here to stay it seems as much as they [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  are trying to negotiate them away, accepting that they may now be a reality and trying [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  to kind of boost the economy in that sense. He was also asked questions about a whole [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=259.64s)]
*  array of issues from welfare, foreign aid, social care as well. In some ways I have to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=263.92s)]
*  say at this particular committee the questions were perhaps more interesting than some of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=271.32000000000005s)]
*  the answers. We've got used to these liaison committees in the days of Boris Johnson being [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=275.36s)]
*  kind of moments with great fireworks and there weren't really any of those today. He managed [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  to kind of deal with a lot of the questions in quite a calm way, commit to writing to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=285.68s)]
*  the committee sometimes if he wasn't sure of the answer but no kind of huge moments [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=290.4s)]
*  as it were from this committee. Quick final thought Hannah, in terms of that list of retaliatory [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  measures, obviously he is saying that he doesn't want to impose that yet and will give room [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  for the sort of talks and negotiations but how long is he prepared to have that as the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  position before he decides well there's no progress on the trade talks, there's no change [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=310.88s)]
*  in US policy on these tariffs so we will think about introducing retaliatory measures. I [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=317.64s)]
*  mean I think that is a key question that hasn't really been answered. The government is consulting [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=323.12s)]
*  with businesses in the UK about the impact of possible retaliatory tariffs, kind of asking [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=328.88s)]
*  them what the knock-on impacts might be in an attempt to sort of get it right. I don't [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=335.88s)]
*  get any sense that they really want to go down that route and they certainly haven't [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=340.8s)]
*  set a deadline as to when they would introduce those kinds of things. The Prime Minister's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=345.48s)]
*  engagement has been a lot with other countries trying to warn against any idea of a trade [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=350.48s)]
*  war or the kinds of measures that you're seeing going on between China and the US. He certainly [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=356.12s)]
*  wants to avoid that, he's encouraging other countries to avoid that so I think the idea [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=362.16s)]
*  that they're going to put a kind of timeline on when they would retaliate is something [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=365.88s)]
*  that's pretty unlikely at the moment. Hannah, thanks very much Hannah Miller there at Westminster, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=369.76s)]
*  let's head and talk to our New York business correspondent Erin Delmore, has been keeping [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=375.12s)]
*  an eye on the markets but also keeping an eye on that session in Washington. Very interesting [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=379.0s)]
*  that Jameson Greer was asked by the lead Democrat a really straightforward question, are these [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=384.12s)]
*  tariffs that are going to come in for so many different countries tomorrow, is that still [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=388.94s)]
*  happening and he got a very clear answer, yes it was, no exceptions. Right and he said [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=392.88s)]
*  that's what the President intends. Now what senators are focused on in this committee [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=400.4s)]
*  here is any space, any room that there might be for any kind of negotiation with these [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=404.67999999999995s)]
*  countries and you did hear Senator Ron Wyden trying to nail down the timing, will these [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  go into effect tomorrow and I do wonder how much space there is in that answer, it was [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=413.44s)]
*  clear as you said Matthew but at the same time Jameson Greer talked about conversations [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=417.08s)]
*  with more than 50 countries that for me actually were pretty eyebrow raising, he said we've [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=421.09999999999997s)]
*  told them, the other countries, if you have a better idea to achieve reciprocity and get [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=426.44s)]
*  our trade deficits down we want to talk to you, if you have an alternative plan we're [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=430.78s)]
*  open to that. Now that does sound like a real olive branch, a real negotiating opening [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=434.0s)]
*  line the message that this administration is putting forward to other countries and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=438.76s)]
*  I do wonder if they are only circling around trade or if they're open to some other deficit [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=442.52s)]
*  reduction measures from other countries, certainly you know there is some sparring during this [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=449.52s)]
*  hearing as well and a lot of focus on China and it does seem from Jameson Greer's testimony [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=454.12s)]
*  China is not on the President's radar to negotiate with chiefly right now. What's your reading [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=459.96s)]
*  of the markets, have they factored in already all the things that we're likely to see tomorrow [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=465.0s)]
*  or are we likely to see another sea of red and it was interesting in the questions there [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=471.08s)]
*  to Mr Greer that a lot of focus on ordinary Americans, on their pension pots, on jobs, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=477.32s)]
*  on prices because that is a real pressure that is coming on all politicians of all stripes. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=485.2s)]
*  Right, and Jameson Greer speaks for the administration here and I heard him putting forward a line [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=492.2s)]
*  that we have heard from President Trump going back to the campaign trail, talking about [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=496.8s)]
*  as you say American workers, American manufacturing but he said clearly this has to be a country [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=500.32s)]
*  that produces goods and Matthew the reason why I bring it up is because when we see the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=504.86s)]
*  deficit totals that were calculated by the administration they seem to have stripped [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=509.2s)]
*  out services and really just focused on goods that are imported and exported to achieve [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=513.24s)]
*  their numbers here and he said we need to be making things in this country from a worker [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=517.6s)]
*  standpoint, a hiring standpoint, from a national security standpoint and he really tapped on [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=521.32s)]
*  this moment back in 2020 when the US found itself unable in its supply chains to get [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=525.8s)]
*  critical materials and the goods that were needed. He really tried to pull on that in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=531.0s)]
*  his testimony to say remember we've been through this. That's the national security objective [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=534.8s)]
*  that the Trump administration speaks of but Matthew there are a lot of objectives in this [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=539.12s)]
*  plan right now. There's a plan to raise revenue off of what President calls a reciprocal or [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=542.84s)]
*  a more level tariff structure but there's also a priority of bringing jobs back to the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=549.32s)]
*  United States and something Senators are trying to get to the bottom of is are we trying to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=554.12s)]
*  generate more revenue off of trade or are we trying to eschew that path and instead [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  try to make things here. It's a dichotomy and they're really trying to get to the bottom [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=562.24s)]
*  of what the President's goal here and the timing of the tariffs. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=566.2s)]
*  Aaron, great stuff. Thanks very much. We'll talk again in the coming hours. We will continue [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  again tomorrow on to that session. It was interesting in that session Jameson Greer [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  talking about the difference between the various countries that are making contact with the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=577.8000000000001s)]
*  Trump administration to have conversations, perhaps to negotiate and he drew an absolute [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=582.24s)]
*  contrast to the approach from Beijing and we saw Beijing and China really in the Trump [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=587.88s)]
*  administration's crosshairs again in the questions and answers. Well, Sean Wan is [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=594.2s)]
*  our reporter in our Global China units and he gave me his analysis of the Chinese response [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=599.0s)]
*  so far to President Trump's tariffs. I think as we've heard so far China this time around [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=604.32s)]
*  has really come out in a very firm stance, very different from previous occasions. This [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=609.72s)]
*  is not the first time Trump has slapped tariffs on Chinese goods. In previous rounds China [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=614.88s)]
*  has been able to sort of retaliate very cautiously, for example, 10% on agricultural goods or [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=620.12s)]
*  taking this case to WTO, all those sort of things. But this time around China is saying [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=627.16s)]
*  that you know what, we're going to put our foot down and we're going to impose another [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=631.92s)]
*  34% of retaliatory tariffs on US goods. So that is quite a strong stance. What we haven't [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=635.6s)]
*  had is, I mean this is moving so quickly, yesterday we had Donald Trump saying because [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=642.12s)]
*  of all of that they're going to put another 50% tariffs on China. We haven't had a response [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=647.04s)]
*  from Beijing on that. If there is a similar response, that sort of 50% tariff going the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=652.28s)]
*  other way, what are the sort of things that Beijing might target? That's sort of a guessing [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=659.28s)]
*  game right now, right? But Beijing does have a lot of tools in this arsenal. For example, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  the first one Trump was saying at the very beginning, the reason why Trump was slamming [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  those tariffs on Chinese goods is because he wanted the negotiation about fentanyl [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=674.44s)]
*  to start. Washington accuses Beijing of supplying precursor materials to fentanyl. So one of [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=679.4s)]
*  the things that Beijing could do is just completely drop out of that negotiation. And second of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=685.12s)]
*  all, when it comes to economic nature stuff, it could impose more tariffs on agricultural [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=689.28s)]
*  goods, which is a major imports coming in from the US to China. And China was also moving [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=694.44s)]
*  the idea of, for example, completely banning poultry from the US and soybeans, all those [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=700.04s)]
*  sort of things are very important. And rare minerals, that is being talked about openly [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  now. Exactly, exactly. And China's threatening of completely banning rare earth mineral to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=710.0s)]
*  the US, which is significantly important for manufacturing a lot of goods in the US as [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  well. Now Donald Trump wants to completely change the way trade works, especially with [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  China in terms of the Chinese economic model that is based largely on exports, isn't it? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=724.96s)]
*  So is there any likelihood of the capacity to change Beijing's thinking? It is important [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=731.96s)]
*  to acknowledge that, as you said earlier, exports do play a major role in China's economy. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=738.12s)]
*  For example, last year alone, 20% of Chinese GDP came from exports. So by sort of focusing [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=743.08s)]
*  on tariffs, that's going to hurt China's economy a lot. But at the same time, China might have [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=749.2800000000001s)]
*  a lot of tools to sort of evade that problem as well. For example, it does have a very [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=754.16s)]
*  sluggish domestic consumer confidence. So what it's trying to do is probably try to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=758.76s)]
*  boost domestic consumption, while at the same time, instead of dumping the goods to third [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=763.24s)]
*  countries, they might well start collaborating with other countries to start their manufacturing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=769.08s)]
*  in other countries as well. So in a sense, building on the Belt and Road policy, we know [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=774.36s)]
*  they've followed over the last few years. We know of the influence, the investment in [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=778.92s)]
*  Africa, for example. So in a sense, try to exploit all of those things. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=784.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. As I said earlier, the US, China has actually reduced its reliance on [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=788.6s)]
*  American market. From 2017, over 20% of China's exports went to the US. Now it's below 15%. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=794.12s)]
*  So by focusing on countries in Africa, for example, the Southeast Asia, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=800.92s)]
*  China is going to be able to explore other options. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQy7xPyk68&t=805.08s)]
