**BBC - World News:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg)
*  If we didn't win, I think this would have very well ended up in a third world war, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=0.0s)]
*  that would not have been a good situation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=5.32s)]
*  What was your second question? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=8.64s)]
*  My second question for President Zelensky. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=9.64s)]
*  Do you ever, why don't you wear a suit? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=11.64s)]
*  Why don't you wear a suit? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=13.84s)]
*  You're the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit, just [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=15.84s)]
*  want to see if you own a suit? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=21.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, problems. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=23.16s)]
*  A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the dignity of this office. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=24.16s)]
*  I will wear a costume after this war will finish. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=32.76s)]
*  Yes, maybe one. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=33.76s)]
*  Maybe something like this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=34.76s)]
*  Maybe something like yours, yes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=35.76s)]
*  That'd be great. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=36.76s)]
*  Maybe something better, I don't know. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=37.76s)]
*  We will see. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=40.76s)]
*  Maybe something cheaper. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=41.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=42.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=43.76s)]
*  Thank you, President Trump. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=44.76s)]
*  Thank you, President Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=45.76s)]
*  Mr. President, are you going to send more arms to Ukraine in case there's no peace? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=46.76s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to have arms to Ukraine, yeah, sure. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=55.76s)]
*  Hopefully I won't have to send very much because hopefully we're going to have it finished. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=59.44s)]
*  We're looking forward to finishing this quickly. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=62.44s)]
*  We're not looking forward to sending a lot of arms. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=65.44s)]
*  We're looking forward to getting the war finished so we can do other things. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=68.44s)]
*  But we very much appreciate the agreement because we needed what they had, and we're [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=73.32s)]
*  treating, you know, our country is now treated fairly. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=78.52s)]
*  Biden didn't do that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=81.72s)]
*  Biden didn't, he didn't know what the hell he was doing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=82.72s)]
*  This should have never happened. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=84.56s)]
*  This should have never started. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=85.56s)]
*  But, you know, sure, the answer is yes, but hopefully we won't have to send much because [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=87.96s)]
*  I'm looking forward to getting it done quickly, very quickly. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=93.96s)]
*  Does that mean you'll provide security guarantees, Mr. President? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=98.96s)]
*  I don't want to talk about security yet because I want to get the deal done. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=101.96s)]
*  You know, you fall into the same trap like everybody else a million times. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  You say it over and over. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=108.56s)]
*  I want to get the deal done. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=110.0s)]
*  Security is so easy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=111.72s)]
*  That's about 2 percent of the problem. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=112.72s)]
*  I'm not worried about security. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=115.12s)]
*  I'm worried about getting the deal done. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=116.76s)]
*  The security is the easy part. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Security is very nice. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Everybody stops shooting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  And now will Europe put people there? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=123.72s)]
*  I know France is going to. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  I know the UK is going to. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  I know other countries are going to, and they happen to be right next door. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=129.0s)]
*  We haven't committed, but we could conceivably. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, we have security in a different form. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=134.52s)]
*  We'll have workers there digging, digging, digging, taking the raw earth so that we can [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  create a lot of great product in this country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  So in that sense, you have something. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=146.88s)]
*  But we haven't determined that yet. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=148.48s)]
*  I will say, in speaking to France and in speaking to, and they were here, as you know, last [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=150.32s)]
*  week and just the other day, they have committed to a lot of security. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=155.64s)]
*  I don't think you're going to need much security. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=162.16s)]
*  I think once this deal gets done, it's over. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=163.76s)]
*  Russia is not going to want to go back and nobody's going to want to go back. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=166.6s)]
*  When this deal ends, I really believe this deal is going to be over. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=170.72s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=177.12s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=178.12s)]
*  You had Kirsten McCrone and Keir Starmer at the White House this past week, both of whom [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=179.12s)]
*  praised your courage and conviction to lead the pathway towards peace. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=183.56s)]
*  Part of that involved, though, re-engaging in Russia and diplomatic relations, something [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=187.64s)]
*  that previous leaders lacked, the conviction to do so. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=191.92s)]
*  What gave you the moral courage and conviction to step forward and lead that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=194.6s)]
*  Oh, I love this guy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=198.0s)]
*  Who are you with? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=199.0s)]
*  One American News, sir. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=200.0s)]
*  Well, that's why I like him. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=201.0s)]
*  One American News does a great job. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  I like the question. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=205.68s)]
*  I think it's a very good question. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=206.68s)]
*  It's a pathway to peace. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=209.44s)]
*  It's a pathway to getting something solved. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  And I feel that as the head of this country, I have an obligation to do that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=214.88s)]
*  Plus, you know, we're very much involved. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=218.52s)]
*  We got involved. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=220.86s)]
*  It's too bad we got involved because there should have been no involvement because there [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=223.36s)]
*  should have been no war. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=226.28s)]
*  And there shouldn't have been October 7th. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=227.88s)]
*  That would have never happened. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=230.2s)]
*  As you know, Iran was broke. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=231.2s)]
*  They had no money to give to Hezbollah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=233.08s)]
*  They had no money to give to Hamas. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=235.0s)]
*  They were stone cold broke. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=237.28s)]
*  And then under Biden, they became rich as hell. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=239.64s)]
*  They went from no money to 300 billion dollars in a period of four years. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=242.76s)]
*  And they gave a lot of that money away. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=249.68s)]
*  And you see what happened. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=251.08s)]
*  And that's a real mess also that we hope to be able to solve. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=253.32s)]
*  But I appreciate your question very much. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=256.88s)]
*  I feel I have an obligation to try and do something to stop the death. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=260.08s)]
*  I can't answer. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=265.2s)]
*  Yes, I can answer. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=267.2s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=269.2s)]
*  Please. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=270.2s)]
*  And I do like your clothing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=271.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=272.2s)]
*  I think he's a great guy, by the way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=273.2s)]
*  I don't know if you two like each other, but you know what? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  I think he's great. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=279.62s)]
*  I think he's dressed beautifully. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=280.62s)]
*  So I have more serious things to answer on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=283.62s)]
*  I will answer on more serious questions if I can. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=287.62s)]
*  Yeah, so please. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=291.62s)]
*  About security guarantees and about justice fire. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=293.38s)]
*  We can't just speak about justice fire and speak and speak. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=297.02s)]
*  It will not work. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=299.9s)]
*  Justice fire will never work because I'm like a president. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=302.02s)]
*  I have this experience and not only me. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=306.02s)]
*  I remember before my presidency, from 2014, Putin broke 25 times. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=309.62s)]
*  25 times he broke his own signature. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=315.62s)]
*  25 times he broke his own signature. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=321.62s)]
*  But he never broke to me. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=323.62s)]
*  No, no, you were the president. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=325.62s)]
*  You were the president. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=327.62s)]
*  In 2016, you were the president, Mr. Pravda. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=329.62s)]
*  You were the president. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=332.62s)]
*  But he had, of course, not with you, but he had during those periods, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=334.62s)]
*  he had conversations with our side. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=338.62s)]
*  And we had Normandy format, you know, the France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=340.62s)]
*  And he broke them 25 times. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=345.62s)]
*  That's why we will never accept just justice fire. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=347.62s)]
*  It will not work without security guarantees. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=351.62s)]
*  Security guarantees, maybe the president is right about this document and the other, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=353.62s)]
*  but this document is not enough. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=359.62s)]
*  Strong army is enough because his soldiers afraid, Putin's soldiers afraid of our soldiers [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=360.62s)]
*  when we're strong enough. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=366.62s)]
*  If we are not strong enough, if we are empty, if our storage is empty, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=367.62s)]
*  we can't defend our land. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=371.62s)]
*  Today, you know, he knows that we have, all the world knows that we have meeting, yes? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=374.62s)]
*  Why he's using ballistic? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=379.62s)]
*  Putin today using ballistic on our hospitals, schools, and etc. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=381.62s)]
*  Ballistic. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=385.62s)]
*  So he knows that we are here and that President Trump is really have good will to stop this war. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=386.62s)]
*  And you're here now, the president. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=393.62s)]
*  So why he's using? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=396.62s)]
*  So he doesn't want to stop. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=397.62s)]
*  He doesn't want. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=398.62s)]
*  But I hope that we will do it, really we'll do it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=399.62s)]
*  Security, when we speak about security guarantees, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=402.62s)]
*  when the Europeans are ready for contingents, they need USA backstop. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=405.62s)]
*  If there will not be United States, we will not never have any contingents, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=412.62s)]
*  strong contingents from the Europeans because they don't want to divide airlines, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=416.62s)]
*  connection between the United States and the main and strongest ally and Europeans. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=420.62s)]
*  This is crucial, this is important. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=427.62s)]
*  That's what we want to speak about very much. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=429.62s)]
*  This is very important. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=432.62s)]
*  And air defense. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=433.62s)]
*  So air defense, really we have big deficit with all the systems and we need to provide this. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=435.62s)]
*  We need it very much. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=441.62s)]
*  Otherwise, Putin will never stop and will go further and further. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=443.62s)]
*  He doesn't want. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=448.62s)]
*  He hates us. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=449.62s)]
*  You know, it's not about me. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=450.62s)]
*  He hates Ukrainians. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=452.62s)]
*  He thinks that we are not a nation. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=453.62s)]
*  He thinks and he shares these thoughts. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=455.62s)]
*  I think maybe with your team also, I don't know. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=458.62s)]
*  But with all the Europeans in media, officially or not, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=460.62s)]
*  he always said that there is no such country, such nation, such language and such life like Ukraine. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=463.62s)]
*  No, he really doesn't respect all the Ukrainians and he wants to destroy us. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=471.62s)]
*  We, and you are right, Mr. President. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=478.62s)]
*  That's 2%. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=481.62s)]
*  These documents, maybe other documents. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=483.62s)]
*  It's a very good start, very good, but it will not enough to stop this person. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=485.62s)]
*  Should Russia maintain or rebuild Ukraine? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=492.62s)]
*  Mr. President, after these certain pieces, should Russia maintain or rebuild Ukraine? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=494.62s)]
*  They have to pay. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=498.62s)]
*  This question, you didn't like it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=499.62s)]
*  This is the rule of the war. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=500.62s)]
*  This is the rule of the war. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=502.62s)]
*  During all the centuries, all the history, this is the rule of the war. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=503.62s)]
*  Who began those pay? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=507.62s)]
*  This is the rule. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=510.62s)]
*  Putin began this war. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=512.62s)]
*  He has to pay all money for innovation. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=513.62s)]
*  He has to pay. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=516.62s)]
*  Of course, some Russian assets, what we have in Europe, about 300 billion, we can use them. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=517.62s)]
*  We can use for innovation and buy military support from the United States also. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=524.62s)]
*  We can do it, but it's not enough. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=529.62s)]
*  It's not enough. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=531.62s)]
*  It's not enough. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=532.62s)]
*  Mr. President, do you envision a trilateral summit with Putin and Putin? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=533.62s)]
*  Wait, one second. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=538.62s)]
*  I ask this question that you didn't like, because I want you to know if you want to position yourself in the middle between Russia and Ukraine or on the Ukraine side. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=540.62s)]
*  No, I'm in the middle. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=550.62s)]
*  I want to solve this thing. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=551.62s)]
*  I'm for both. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=552.62s)]
*  I want to get it solved. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=554.62s)]
*  And it's wonderful to speak badly about somebody else, but I want to get it solved. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=555.62s)]
*  If we can solve it, great. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=563.62s)]
*  If we can't solve it, they're going to have to find it out. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=564.62s)]
*  And who knows what's going to happen. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=566.62s)]
*  But I want to see it get solved. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=568.62s)]
*  May I follow up? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=570.62s)]
*  One more question about U.S. troops in Europe. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=571.62s)]
*  After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, your predecessor sent additional troops to Eastern Europe, including Poland, my country. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=574.62s)]
*  Are you committed to keeping these troops on the Eastern flank of NATO in the future? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=583.62s)]
*  I'm very committed to Poland. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=592.62s)]
*  I think Poland has really stepped up and done a great job for NATO. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=594.62s)]
*  As you know, they paid more than they had to. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=598.62s)]
*  They are one of the finest groups of people I've ever known. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=600.62s)]
*  I'm very committed to Poland. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=605.62s)]
*  What about the Baltics? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=607.62s)]
*  Poland's in a tough neighborhood, you know. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=608.62s)]
*  What about the Baltics? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=609.62s)]
*  The Baltics, they got a lot of — it's a tough neighborhood, too. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=611.62s)]
*  But we're committed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=618.62s)]
*  We're going to be very committed. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=619.62s)]
*  And we're committed to NATO. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=621.62s)]
*  But NATO has to step up, and the Europeans have to step up more than they have. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=622.62s)]
*  And I want to see them equalize, because they are in for far less than we're in. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=626.62s)]
*  And they should be at least equal. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=631.62s)]
*  You understand that? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=633.62s)]
*  Why is the United States — we have an ocean in between. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=634.62s)]
*  Why is the United States in for so much more money and other things as Europe? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=637.62s)]
*  With that being said — and as you said, they've also been obviously very helpful. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=643.62s)]
*  But we have put in far more than they have. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=647.62s)]
*  And I think they should equalize. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=650.62s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm really sorry. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=652.62s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=654.62s)]
*  I want to ask you about the agreement against today. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=655.62s)]
*  What changed between the first time that Secretary Vinson gave President Zelensky the agreement and today for the signing? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=657.62s)]
*  We made a deal. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=663.62s)]
*  So — [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=664.62s)]
*  Well, it was the — [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=665.62s)]
*  I'm just — [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=666.62s)]
*  — the signing factor — [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=667.62s)]
*  I'm a business person. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=668.62s)]
*  We made a deal. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=669.62s)]
*  That's what changed. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=670.62s)]
*  Mr. President — [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=671.62s)]
*  I didn't think we were going to make a deal. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=672.62s)]
*  And we ended up making the deal. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=673.62s)]
*  So, that changed. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=676.62s)]
*  Mr. President, and why and how do you envision a trilateral summit with President Zelensky and — [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=677.62s)]
*  I don't know, but it's — [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=681.62s)]
*  — these circumstances? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=682.62s)]
*  Well, they don't like each other. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=683.62s)]
*  I can tell you that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=684.62s)]
*  They do not like each other. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=685.62s)]
*  This is not a love match. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=687.62s)]
*  And it's unfortunate. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=689.62s)]
*  That's why you're in this situation. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=690.62s)]
*  The United States should not have allowed this to happen. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=693.62s)]
*  Okay? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=696.62s)]
*  The United States, run by a man that didn't know much — I'm going to be very nice — run [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=697.62s)]
*  by an incompetent person — very incompetent person — should never have allowed this [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=705.62s)]
*  to happen. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=711.62s)]
*  I've stopped wars. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=712.62s)]
*  I've stopped many wars. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=713.62s)]
*  My people will tell you I stopped wars that nobody ever heard about. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=714.62s)]
*  I stopped wars before they ever started. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=717.62s)]
*  I can look at some of — I could give you a lot of nations that would tell you right [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=720.62s)]
*  now they were probably going to war. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=725.62s)]
*  I could tell you right now there's a nation thinking about going to war on something that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=726.62s)]
*  nobody in this room has ever even heard of — two smaller nations, but big, still big. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=731.62s)]
*  And I think I've stopped it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=737.62s)]
*  But this should have never happened. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=740.62s)]
*  Mr. President — [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=742.62s)]
*  About — sorry, just a second. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=743.62s)]
*  About any negotiations. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=746.62s)]
*  First of all, I want really to tell you — and I think that everybody understands that Ukraine, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=748.62s)]
*  modern Ukrainians, nobody wants to stop this war. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=755.62s)]
*  But that the future — any negotiations, it's understandable that two sides of the war — not [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=758.62s)]
*  Russia and the United States, because this is not the war between Russia and the United [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=766.62s)]
*  States. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=770.62s)]
*  This is war of Russia against Ukraine and Ukrainian people. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=771.62s)]
*  So these two sides will be — anyway, will be at the negotiation table. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=774.62s)]
*  Then, of course, United States, like their strongest partner of the Ukraine. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=781.62s)]
*  And, of course, Europe. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=787.62s)]
*  I think Europe is very important. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=789.62s)]
*  I want to speak about it with the President. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=791.62s)]
*  Yes, Europe is very important for us, because we really defend Europe for today. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=793.62s)]
*  All Europeans really recognize that we are defending the line, and they have real life, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=799.62s)]
*  and our people are dying. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=805.62s)]
*  That's why they helped us. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=806.62s)]
*  And also, it's about the nature. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=808.62s)]
*  Yes, between — like the President said, you have big, nice ocean. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=810.62s)]
*  Yes, between us. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=815.62s)]
*  But if we will not stay, Russia will go further to Baltics and to Poland, by the way. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=818.62s)]
*  But first to the Baltics. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=824.62s)]
*  It's understandable for them, because they've been in the USSR. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=825.62s)]
*  You know, they've been one of the republics of the USSR. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=830.62s)]
*  And Putin wants to bring them back to his empire. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=834.62s)]
*  It's a fact. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=837.62s)]
*  And when he will go there, if we will not stay, you will fight. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=838.62s)]
*  You're American soldiers. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=842.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=844.62s)]
*  Do you have ocean or not? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=845.62s)]
*  Your soldiers will fight. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=847.62s)]
*  It was my question. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=855.62s)]
*  I don't want to talk about Odessa now. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=857.62s)]
*  Let's not talk about Odessa. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=860.62s)]
*  I want to talk about making a deal, getting peace. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=862.62s)]
*  We don't have to talk about Odessa. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=865.62s)]
*  But a lot of cities have been destroyed. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=867.62s)]
*  A lot of cities that are not recognizable. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=869.62s)]
*  There's not a building standing. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=872.62s)]
*  And a lot of — a lot of — [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=874.62s)]
*  You have to come and look. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=876.62s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=878.62s)]
*  We have very good cities. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=879.62s)]
*  Yes, a lot of things have been destroyed. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=881.62s)]
*  But mostly cities alive. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=883.62s)]
*  And people work. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=886.62s)]
*  And children go to school. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=887.62s)]
*  Sometimes it's very difficult. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=889.62s)]
*  Sometimes closer to the front line. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=890.62s)]
*  Children have to go to underground schools or online. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=892.62s)]
*  But we live. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=896.62s)]
*  Ukraine is fighting. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=897.62s)]
*  And Ukraine lives. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=899.62s)]
*  This is very important. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=900.62s)]
*  And maybe it's Putin sharing this information that he destroyed us. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=902.62s)]
*  He lost 700,000 people. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=906.62s)]
*  700,000 soldiers. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=909.62s)]
*  They lost everything. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=911.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=913.62s)]
*  So — [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=914.62s)]
*  The Press. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=915.62s)]
*  Mr. President, when did you last speak with President Putin? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=916.62s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=918.62s)]
*  The Press. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=919.62s)]
*  When did you last speak with President Putin? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=920.62s)]
*  And what did he say that he — [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=921.62s)]
*  A couple of days ago. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=922.62s)]
*  The Press. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=923.62s)]
*  And what did he tell you that gave you the assurance that he wanted peace? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=924.62s)]
*  Well, that's what I do. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=927.62s)]
*  My whole life is deals. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=928.62s)]
*  I know pretty good. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=929.62s)]
*  And I really — I've known him for a long time. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=930.62s)]
*  I've dealt with him for a long time. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=935.62s)]
*  He had to suffer through the Russia hoax. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=937.62s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia was a hoax. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=940.62s)]
*  It was all Biden. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=942.62s)]
*  It was nothing to do with him. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=943.62s)]
*  So he had to suffer through that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=944.62s)]
*  And he was able to do that. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=946.62s)]
*  I think that he wants to make a deal, and he'd like to see it end. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=948.62s)]
*  That's all I do. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=953.62s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=954.62s)]
*  My whole life, that's what I do, is make deals. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=955.62s)]
*  What do you have to say to — [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=957.62s)]
*  I'm in the middle of a mess because this is a real mess. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=958.62s)]
*  It's a very dangerous one. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=961.62s)]
*  If this doesn't get solved now, it's not going to get solved for a long time. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=963.62s)]
*  So I hope we're going to — I hope we're going to get it solved. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=967.62s)]
*  In the back, please. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=969.62s)]
*  The Press. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=970.62s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=971.62s)]
*  Prime Minister Stalmer claimed repeatedly that his government believes in free speech [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=972.62s)]
*  and is not engaged in censorship. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=976.62s)]
*  But especially his government arrests people for means and thought crimes, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=978.62s)]
*  and even more so than is pressuring American companies to censor Americans on its behalf. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=982.62s)]
*  How can he be a reliable, trustworthy partner when he says things that are demonstrably false on such an important topic? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=989.62s)]
*  The President. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=995.62s)]
*  Well, we actually spoke to him about that yesterday, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=996.62s)]
*  and we thought they took it very, very much too far. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=997.62s)]
*  JD was very strong on it. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1000.62s)]
*  So was I. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1002.62s)]
*  So was Marco. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1004.62s)]
*  And we've been speaking to him about it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1005.62s)]
*  Marco, would you like to say something about that? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1007.62s)]
*  Yeah, we have concerns, obviously, with the conduct of — particularly as it impacts Americans. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1009.62s)]
*  And there's real concern that American speech, which is online, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1014.62s)]
*  could fall into the hands of the British or any country's jurisdiction. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1017.62s)]
*  And so this is a point the Vice President made of Munich, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1020.62s)]
*  and I think it's a very compelling one, that what unites us with Europe, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1023.62s)]
*  as much as anything else, is these shared values, and one of them being free speech. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1026.62s)]
*  And so if Americans are threatened by it, we're going to need to take action in that regard. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1030.62s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1035.62s)]
*  It's actually a very important question. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1037.62s)]
*  We spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, and others at lunch yesterday. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1039.62s)]
*  And I know that Secretary of Commerce Lutnick followed up in private meetings last night. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1044.62s)]
*  This is really important. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1050.62s)]
*  We believe Americans have the right to speak their mind, even if we in this room disagree with them. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1052.62s)]
*  They have the right to speak their mind in the public square, which is often online these days. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1056.62s)]
*  And we're going to defend that right as it pertains to American companies and American citizens vigorously if we have to. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1061.62s)]
*  I do think that under the President's leadership, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1067.62s)]
*  we're going to find common ground with our friends in the UK on this question, but it remains to be seen. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1069.62s)]
*  The principle that will guide us is we believe in free speech in this country, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1074.62s)]
*  and we'll fight for it for American citizens. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1078.62s)]
*  Mr. President, on the deal, is there any other oil and gas component for the deal? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1080.62s)]
*  A little bit. We'll see. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1085.62s)]
*  On LNG? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1087.62s)]
*  But we're not really looking for that so much. We've got a lot. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1088.62s)]
*  We have more than anybody in the world by far. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1090.62s)]
*  So no, we're not talking about it too much, but a little bit. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1093.62s)]
*  I think it affects also. But for the most part, no. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1095.62s)]
*  And sir, is there any agreement from Ukraine to purchase U.S. LNG as part of the deal? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1099.62s)]
*  No. No. We don't need that. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1107.62s)]
*  Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you about it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1110.62s)]
*  You just mentioned that you guys spoke to Vladimir Putin a couple of days ago. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1112.62s)]
*  Just to be clear, that's a new call, not the one that you were talking about. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1115.62s)]
*  I've spoken to him on numerous occasions. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1118.62s)]
*  Okay. And how was the latest call? What did you discuss? How did it go? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1121.62s)]
*  Are you serious with that, Greg? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1126.62s)]
*  I am. I'd love to know. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1128.62s)]
*  It went well. I think we're going to have a deal. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1129.62s)]
*  On the minerals, Mr. President, some of those minerals are in the east of Ukraine, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1133.62s)]
*  not far from the front lines and in areas that Russia has occupied. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1136.62s)]
*  Will you direct President Putin to withdraw his forces from those areas if there's U.S. interests? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1139.62s)]
*  Well, we'll take a look at it at the time. We have a lot of area. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1145.62s)]
*  It's a very big area we're talking about. So we'll take a look. I'll study that and I'll see. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1148.62s)]
*  And who will protect those minerals if they are U.S. interests? Would that be Ukrainian forces? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1153.62s)]
*  We'll protect them. The agreement will protect them. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1157.62s)]
*  U.S. forces? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1159.62s)]
*  The agreement. Yeah, we're signing an agreement. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1160.62s)]
*  So you're saying that Russia tries to invade or there's Russian aggression in your spot? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1162.62s)]
*  I just told you I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1166.62s)]
*  And if that were going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1168.62s)]
*  If I thought that was going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1170.62s)]
*  Some people may wonder why. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1172.62s)]
*  You know, you ought to focus on CNN on survival, not asking me these ridiculous questions. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1174.62s)]
*  Why would the public want to know? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1179.62s)]
*  Focus on surviving because CNN's got such low ratings, I don't think they're going to survive. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1181.62s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1185.62s)]
*  I already mentioned Poland. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1188.62s)]
*  Poland was under Russian control for decades after the Second World War. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1191.62s)]
*  When I was a kid, I looked at the United States not only as the most powerful country, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1197.62s)]
*  the richest country in the world, the country that has great music, great movies, great muscle cars, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1203.62s)]
*  but also as a force for good. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1210.62s)]
*  And now I'm talking with my friends in Poland, and they are worried that you align yourself too much with Putin. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1214.62s)]
*  What's your message for them? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1221.62s)]
*  Well, if I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1224.62s)]
*  You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1230.62s)]
*  Hi Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1234.62s)]
*  That doesn't work that way. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1236.62s)]
*  I'm not aligned with Putin. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1238.62s)]
*  I'm not aligned with anybody. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1239.62s)]
*  I'm aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1241.62s)]
*  I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1245.62s)]
*  You see the hatred he's got for Putin. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1249.62s)]
*  It's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hatred. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1251.62s)]
*  He's got tremendous hatred, and I understand that, but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with him either. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1253.62s)]
*  So it's not a question of alignment. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1262.62s)]
*  I'm aligned with the world. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1265.62s)]
*  I want to get the thing said. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1267.62s)]
*  I'm aligned with Europe. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1268.62s)]
*  I want to see if we can get this thing done. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1269.62s)]
*  You want me to be tough? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1273.62s)]
*  I could be tougher than any human being you've ever seen. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1275.62s)]
*  I'd be so tough, but you're never going to get a deal that way. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1277.62s)]
*  So that's the way it goes. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1281.62s)]
*  One more question. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1282.62s)]
*  I will respond to this. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1283.62s)]
*  So look, for four years in the United States of America, we had a president who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1286.62s)]
*  And then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1293.62s)]
*  The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1298.62s)]
*  We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States' words mattered more than the president of the United States' actions. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1304.62s)]
*  What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1315.62s)]
*  That's what President Trump is doing. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1319.62s)]
*  Can I ask you? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1321.62s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1323.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1324.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1325.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1326.62s)]
*  So he occupied our parts, big parts of Ukraine, parts of East and Crimea. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1327.62s)]
*  So he occupied it on 2014. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1334.62s)]
*  So during a lot of years, I'm not speaking about just Biden, but those time was Obama, then President Obama, then President Trump, then President Biden, now President Trump. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1338.62s)]
*  And God bless now, President Trump will stop him. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1351.62s)]
*  But during 2014, nobody stopped him. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1354.62s)]
*  He just occupied and took. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1357.62s)]
*  He killed people. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1359.62s)]
*  You know what the contact was? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1360.62s)]
*  2015. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1361.62s)]
*  2014. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1363.62s)]
*  2014. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1364.62s)]
*  2014. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1365.62s)]
*  So he killed. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1366.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1367.62s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1368.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1369.62s)]
*  But during 2014 till 2022, the situation was the same. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1370.62s)]
*  People had been dying on the contact line. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1375.62s)]
*  Nobody stopped him. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1378.62s)]
*  You know that we had conversations with him, a lot of conversations, my bilateral conversations. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1380.62s)]
*  And we signed with him, me, like a new president. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1385.62s)]
*  In 2019, I signed with him the deal. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1389.62s)]
*  I signed with him, Macron and Merkel. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1393.62s)]
*  We signed ceasefire, ceasefire. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1396.62s)]
*  All of them told me that he will never go. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1399.62s)]
*  We signed him with gas contract, gas contract. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1402.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1407.62s)]
*  But after that, he broken the ceasefire. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1408.62s)]
*  He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1410.62s)]
*  We signed the exchange of prisons, but he didn't do it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1414.62s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1418.62s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1422.62s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1424.62s)]
*  Yes, but if you are not strong... [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1428.62s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1429.62s)]
*  Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1435.62s)]
*  You should be thanking the president to bring it into this conflict. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1441.62s)]
*  Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1444.62s)]
*  I have been to... [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1448.62s)]
*  And come once. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1449.62s)]
*  I've actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1450.62s)]
*  Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1459.62s)]
*  We have problems. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1463.62s)]
*  And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1464.62s)]
*  A lot of questions. Let's start from the beginning. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1473.62s)]
*  Sure. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1475.62s)]
*  During the war, everybody has problems. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1476.62s)]
*  Even you. But you have nice ocean. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1479.62s)]
*  And don't feel now. But you will feel it in the future. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1481.62s)]
*  God bless. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1485.62s)]
*  You don't know that. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1486.62s)]
*  God bless. God bless. You will not have a war. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1487.62s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1489.62s)]
*  We're trying to solve a problem. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1491.62s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1493.62s)]
*  I'm not telling you. I'm not saying on this question. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1494.62s)]
*  Because you're in no position to dictate that. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1496.62s)]
*  That's exactly what you're doing. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1497.62s)]
*  You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1498.62s)]
*  We're going to feel very good. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1503.62s)]
*  You will feel influence. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1504.62s)]
*  We're going to feel very good and very strong. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1505.62s)]
*  You will feel influence. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1507.62s)]
*  You're right now not in a very good position. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1508.62s)]
*  You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1510.62s)]
*  And he's happy to be right about it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1513.62s)]
*  From the very beginning of the war, Mr. President, I was... [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1515.62s)]
*  You're not in a good position. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1518.62s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1519.62s)]
*  With us, you start having cards. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1520.62s)]
*  I'm not playing cards. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1522.62s)]
*  Right now, you're not playing cards. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1523.62s)]

*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1534.62s)]
*  I'm with all respect to your name. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1539.62s)]
*  Far more than a lot of people said they should have. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1541.62s)]
*  Have you said thank you once? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1544.62s)]
*  A lot of times. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1545.62s)]
*  No, in this entire meeting that you said thank you. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1546.62s)]
*  Even today. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1548.62s)]
*  You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1549.62s)]
*  Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1553.62s)]
*  and the President who's trying to save your country. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1557.62s)]
*  Please, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can speak... [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1562.62s)]
*  He's not speaking loudly. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1567.62s)]
*  He's not speaking loudly. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1568.62s)]
*  Your country is in big trouble. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1569.62s)]
*  Can I answer? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1571.62s)]
*  No, no. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1572.62s)]
*  You've done a lot of talking. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1573.62s)]
*  Your country is in big trouble. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1574.62s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1575.62s)]
*  You're not winning. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1576.62s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1577.62s)]
*  You're not winning this. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1578.62s)]
*  You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1579.62s)]
*  Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1582.62s)]
*  From the very beginning of the war, we've been alone. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1585.62s)]
*  And we are thankful. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1587.62s)]
*  I said thanks in this cabinet. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1588.62s)]
*  You haven't been allowed. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1589.62s)]
*  We gave you through this stupid President $350 billion. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1590.62s)]
*  We gave you military equipment. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1595.62s)]
*  And you met our brave but they had to use our military. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1597.62s)]
*  If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1600.62s)]
*  In three days. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1608.62s)]
*  I heard it from Putin. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1609.62s)]
*  In three days. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1610.62s)]
*  This is something to do in two weeks. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1611.62s)]
*  Maybe less. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1613.62s)]
*  Of course, yes. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1614.62s)]
*  It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1615.62s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1618.62s)]
*  Just say thank you. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1619.62s)]
*  I said it a little time ago. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1620.62s)]
*  Accept that there are disagreements. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1622.62s)]
*  And let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media when you're wrong. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1625.62s)]
*  We know that you're wrong. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1631.62s)]
*  But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1632.62s)]
*  I understand, sir. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1635.62s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1636.62s)]
*  That's why I kept this going so long. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1637.62s)]
*  You have to be thankful. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1639.62s)]
*  You don't have the cards. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1641.62s)]
*  You're buried there. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1643.62s)]
*  You're people that died. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1644.62s)]
*  I can tell you. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1646.62s)]
*  You're running low on soldiers. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1647.62s)]
*  Listen. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1648.62s)]
*  You're running low on soldiers. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1649.62s)]
*  It would be a damn good thing. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1651.62s)]
*  Then you tell us, I don't want to cease fire. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1653.62s)]
*  I don't want to cease fire. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1655.62s)]
*  I want to go. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1657.62s)]
*  And I want this. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1658.62s)]
*  Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I'd tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1659.62s)]
*  Of course we want to stop the war. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1666.62s)]
*  But you're saying you don't want to cease fire. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1668.62s)]
*  But I said to you, we're guaranteed. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1669.62s)]
*  Because you'll get a ceasefire faster than a degree. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1671.62s)]
*  I ask our people about ceasefire. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1673.62s)]
*  What they think. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1675.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter for you. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1676.62s)]
*  That wasn't with me. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1677.62s)]
*  That was with a guy named Biden who was not a smart person. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1678.62s)]
*  That was with Obama. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1683.62s)]
*  It was your president. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1685.62s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1686.62s)]
*  That was with Obama who gave you sheets and I gave you javelins. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1687.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1690.62s)]
*  I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1691.62s)]
*  Obama gave you sheets. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1694.62s)]
*  In fact, the statement is Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1696.62s)]
*  You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1701.62s)]
*  With us, you have the cards. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1706.62s)]
*  But without us, you don't have any cards. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1708.62s)]
*  One more question to Mr. Vice President. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1710.62s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1713.62s)]
*  It's going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1714.62s)]
*  What if Russia breaks this fire? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1718.62s)]
*  What if Russia breaks these talks? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1721.62s)]
*  What do you do then? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1723.62s)]
*  I understand that it's a heated conversation right now. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1725.62s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1728.62s)]
*  She's asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1729.62s)]
*  What if anything? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1732.62s)]
*  What if a bomb drops on your head right now? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1734.62s)]
*  Okay? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1737.62s)]
*  What if they broke it? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1738.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1739.62s)]
*  They broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn't respect him. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1740.62s)]
*  They didn't respect Obama. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1743.62s)]
*  They respect me. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1745.62s)]
*  Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1747.62s)]
*  He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1749.62s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1754.62s)]
*  You ever hear of that deal? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1755.62s)]
*  That was a phony, that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1756.62s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, Shifty Adam Schiff. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1761.62s)]
*  It was a Democrat scam. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1764.62s)]
*  And he had to go through that. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1766.62s)]
*  And he did go through it. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1768.62s)]
*  We didn't end up in a war. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1769.62s)]
*  And he went through it. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1771.62s)]
*  He was accused of all that stuff. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1772.62s)]
*  He had nothing to do with it. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1774.62s)]
*  It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1775.62s)]
*  It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1778.62s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1781.62s)]
*  And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1783.62s)]
*  The 51 agents. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1789.62s)]
*  The whole thing was a scam. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1791.62s)]
*  And he had to put up with that. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1792.62s)]
*  He was being accused of all that stuff. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1794.62s)]
*  All I can say is this. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1796.62s)]
*  He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1798.62s)]
*  He did, maybe. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1804.62s)]
*  Maybe he didn't. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1805.62s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1806.62s)]
*  But he didn't break them with me. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1807.62s)]
*  He wants to make a deal. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1808.62s)]
*  I don't know if he can make a deal. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1809.62s)]
*  The problem is I've empowered you to be a tough guy. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1811.62s)]
*  And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1815.62s)]
*  And your people are very brave. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1819.62s)]
*  But you're either going to make a deal or we're out. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1821.62s)]
*  And if we're out, you'll fight it out. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1824.62s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1826.62s)]
*  But you don't have the cards. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1830.62s)]
*  But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1832.62s)]
*  But you're not acting at all thankful. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1836.62s)]
*  And that's not a nice thing. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1838.62s)]
*  I'll be honest, that's not a nice thing. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1839.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1841.62s)]
*  I think we've seen enough. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1842.62s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1844.62s)]
*  This is going to be great television. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1845.62s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg&t=1848.62s)]
