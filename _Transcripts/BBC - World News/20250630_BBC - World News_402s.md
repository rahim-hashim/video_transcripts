Video Description: The US must rule out any further strikes on Iran if it wants to resume diplomatic talks, Tehran's deputy foreign minister has told the BBC.
 
Majid Takht-Ravanchi said the Trump administration told Iran through mediators that it wanted to return to negotiations this week, but had not made its position clear on the "very important question" of further attacks while talks are taking place.
 
The US and Iran were involved in talks over Iran's nuclear programme when Israel struck Iranian nuclear sites and military infrastructure earlier this month and Iran responded with missiles.
 
The US became directly involved in the conflict on 21 June when it bombed three of Iran's nuclear sites.

*  Iran has insisted on its right to continue enriching uranium just over a week after the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=0.0s)]
*  US joined Israel in bombing its main nuclear sites. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=6.48s)]

*  Posting on social media, Donald Trump said he was not speaking to Iran's leaders or offering [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=20.48s)]

*  facilities. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=32.0s)]
*  And in the last few minutes, Iran has responded with a foreign ministry spokesperson saying [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=33.0s)]
*  we cannot rely on the US president's statements and changing positions. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=38.44s)]
*  Our chief international correspondent, Liz De Sette, is being allowed to report in Iran [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=44.08s)]

*  This law from Iranian authorities applies to all international media organisations [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=53.76s)]
*  operating in Iran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  Here's Liz's report. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  A city in the eyes of the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  Tehran. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=67.32s)]
*  Where the fragile truce holds. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=69.08s)]
*  On the streets, reminders of the 12-day war. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=71.66s)]

*  One of Iran's top diplomats wants to make clear when bombs fell this month, they were [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  negotiating with America. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=86.08s)]
*  He insists that can't happen again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  We are hearing from Washington telling us that they want to talk. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=91.04s)]
*  So by the way, no date has been set. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=97.04s)]
*  President Trump talked about this week. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=100.76s)]
*  I'm telling you, I'm telling you that we have not agreed to any date. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=102.48s)]
*  We have not agreed to the modality. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=107.84s)]
*  Right now we are seeking an answer to this question. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=111.2s)]
*  Are we going to see a repetition of an act of aggression while we are engaging in dialogue? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=116.68s)]
*  Satellite imagery shows Iran's nuclear sites were badly damaged. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=124.92s)]
*  But Iran still says it won't stop enriching uranium. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=129.32s)]
*  Why should we agree to such a proposal? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=133.28s)]
*  Because Iranians on this visit have told us that Iran has paid too high a price for enriching [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=137.52s)]
*  uranium, causing suspicions even among your European partners. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=144.04s)]
*  About why you were enriching to 60 percent, it wasn't necessary. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=148.32s)]
*  First of all, 60 percent is something which is being used for peaceful purposes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=153.4s)]
*  But it did create this situation of suspicion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=159.4s)]
*  The level of that can be discussed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=162.52s)]
*  The capacity can be discussed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=165.44s)]
*  But to say that you should not have enrichment, you should have zero enrichment, and if you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=168.04s)]
*  do not agree we will bomb you, that is the law of the jungle. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  But they would say Iran has to do more to reassure the world that its nuclear program, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=177.04s)]
*  its ballistic missile program, isn't threatening. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=180.72s)]
*  We were discussing with Americans. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=183.12s)]
*  We were in the middle of talks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  All of a sudden we face a clear act of aggression. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=189.32s)]
*  And those who are criticizing us, they should criticize the way that we have been treated. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=193.72s)]
*  They should criticize the Americans. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=199.64s)]
*  They should criticize the Israelis. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=201.64s)]
*  And if they do not have the guts to criticize America, they should keep silent, not try [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=203.68s)]
*  to justify the aggression. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=209.68s)]
*  Iranians worry the dark of war will return. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=214.36s)]
*  Their days lived with no guarantee. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  Life will get better or worse. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=221.44s)]
*  Their lives held hostage to age old enmities. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=224.16s)]
*  That report by the BBC's Least Dissent in Tehran there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=230.12s)]
*  As the ceasefire between Iran and Israel continues, Israel's prime minister says his country's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=235.56s)]
*  12-day war with Tehran has opened up many opportunities to release the remaining hostages [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=246.24s)]
*  But Benjamin Netanyahu stressed that the only way to end the conflict was to eliminate [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=247.56s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=252.44s)]
*  It comes as a wave of Israeli airstrikes across much of Gaza overnight has reportedly triggered [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=253.72s)]
*  the displacement of hundreds of Palestinian families. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=260.36s)]
*  The bombardment follows one of the largest evacuation orders issued by Israel since the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=264.44s)]
*  war with Hamas resumed in March. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=270.08s)]
*  Our correspondent Wera Davies is in Jerusalem. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=273.08s)]
*  He gave us the latest on what the prime minister had to say. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=276.24s)]
*  This was the prime minister on one hand basking in the glory of a military victory over Iran. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=280.36s)]
*  Mr Netanyahu said that it had presented opportunities including first of all, said the prime minister, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=286.68s)]
*  to free the hostages remaining in Gaza and then the military victory against Hamas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=292.88s)]
*  Now, those words were seized upon by many in Israel, including the families of the hostages [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=297.64s)]
*  still being held because they said it was the first time that Mr Netanyahu had really [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=302.2s)]
*  emphasised first of all the need to release those 20 or so living hostages in Gaza and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=306.64s)]
*  the bodies of 25 or so hostages who are dead. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=313.64s)]
*  Now, they've always accused Mr Netanyahu of prioritising military victory against Hamas [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  before the release of the hostages. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=322.24s)]
*  Now, it's too early to tell, I think, really, if this is a change of emphasis from the Israeli [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=323.64s)]
*  government, particularly because overnight we've seen an intensification of Israeli air [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=327.8s)]
*  strikes over parts of northern Gaza in particular. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=332.36s)]
*  Over the weekend, the Israeli army had warned thousands of residents of Gaza City and parts [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=335.72s)]
*  of northern Gaza to evacuate their homes in anticipation of these air strikes. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=340.64s)]
*  First-hand reports from Gaza overnight talk about perhaps some of the most intense air [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=345.4s)]
*  strikes since the resumption of the war in March. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=349.2s)]
*  The first building that was hit in eastern Gaza City, for example, was a former school [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=354.76s)]
*  where hundreds of families had been sheltering from the war and there were said to be several [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  fatalities there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  So it's too early to say, I think, whether there's pressure on Netanyahu to give time [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  towards trying to achieve a ceasefire deal, release the hostages and the end of the war [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  as he's being insisted to do publicly by Donald Trump, or whether the Israeli army is preparing [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=375.56s)]
*  for the end of the war. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=381.96s)]
*  One thing we have heard over recent days are rumours in the Israeli press that some members [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=386.96s)]
*  of the Israeli military are near to thinking that perhaps they have finally achieved or [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  they're near to achieving all of their military aims in Gaza. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=396.12s)]
*  But the war certainly does continue. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcqZddaz3_I&t=399.47999999999996s)]
