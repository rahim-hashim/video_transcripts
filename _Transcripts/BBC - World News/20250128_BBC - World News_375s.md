Video Description: Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned home to northern Gaza on foot, with many returning to find their homes reduced to rubble. 
 
As many as 700,000 people fled from Gaza City and the surrounding areas during the early weeks of the war.
 
The UN estimates that around 70% of the Gaza Strip's buildings have been damaged or destroyed since October 2023, with much of the worst destruction in the north.

*  According to Hamas officials, more than 300,000 displaced Palestinians moved from southern [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=0.0s)]
*  parts of Gaza where they had been seeking shelter from the war, back to northern Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=4.64s)]

*  For 15 months, home was a place Gazans carried inside them, whatever else they carried, whatever [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=29.08s)]
*  they lost. Today the road home was reopened, reclaimed, remembered. The war made nomads [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=38.92s)]
*  of Gaza's people. This journey is the one they'd waited to make. Rizak Al Qasas was [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=48.28s)]
*  walking slowly, his granddaughter's pace, family survivors, old and young. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=55.84s)]
*  I collected her father in pieces from Khan Younis. Thank God I'm crying from happiness. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=65.4s)]
*  I don't want anything except to enter my land, even if I only eat mud. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=71.72s)]
*  More than half a million people were displaced from northern Gaza during the war, some of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=80.48s)]
*  those returning now fearful of what home will look like, others who don't remember it at [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=84.8s)]
*  all. My feeling is indescribable. What am I expecting? We will see the same destruction [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=92.72s)]
*  that we have seen here. There is no alternative. We're going from emptiness to emptiness. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  This is the home many return to. Satellite images suggest three quarters of Gaza City's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=109.16s)]
*  buildings have been damaged or destroyed. Houses burnt, businesses looted, relatives [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=114.84s)]
*  still buried in the rubble. Hamas officials have called for 130,000 emergency tents to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  shelter people returning to the north. Gaza's displaced, still homeless, even after coming [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=128.88s)]
*  home. The road outside once divided by military checkpoints, now a place of reunions. Israeli [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=136.12s)]
*  soldiers withdrawn, replaced by familiar faces. The impact of this truce is taking hold, but [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=148.84s)]
*  talks on extending it into a permanent ceasefire, talks on Gaza's future haven't yet begun. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=158.28s)]
*  For Gazans, the road back home is open, but the path ahead is unclear. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=165.28s)]
*  Lucy Williamson, our correspondent Nick Beek is following developments from Jerusalem and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=173.28s)]
*  told us about the journeys many Palestinians are making as they return to their homes in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=179.08s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=183.88s)]
*  We're getting some really vivid accounts of people who've made the trip from the south [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  back to the north. They set off, they say, with great expectations and hope that finally [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=189.28s)]
*  they're able to go back to their neighborhoods after 15 months of war. But so many people [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=195.56s)]
*  are saying that actually when they turn the corner, they get back to the streets that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  they knew. There's nothing remaining of their houses. In some cases, maybe just one room [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=204.92s)]
*  is still standing, a fragment of the house that they knew. Lots of people are saying [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=210.72s)]
*  this and also the lucky ones are very much in the minority, those whose homes have been [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=215.28s)]
*  spared. At the same time, charities are saying that at the moment they've got an opportunity [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=221.16s)]
*  to bring in more aid. They've really boosted the amount of medicine and other supplies [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  getting in, but there's a really big problem. They talk about the electricity and the water [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  being these essentials that simply aren't there at the moment. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=236.24s)]
*  What help is there then available to them in terms of aid getting through? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=241.52s)]
*  Well, this is the big question because as part of this ceasefire deal, which is for [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=248.52s)]
*  now holding, although it's fragile by nature, at least 600 trucks are supposed to be coming [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=252.32s)]
*  into Gaza every day. A week ago, just in the hours after the ceasefire came into effect, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=258.4s)]
*  there was something like 900 trucks every day. That had fallen to around 300 last Friday. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=265.11999999999995s)]
*  Not immediately sure why that is, but charities say they are bringing things in. I mean, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=270.67999999999995s)]
*  emergency shelter is really important and so we're talking about tents, in some cases [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=277.44s)]
*  caravans. These are seen as essential because people may well have gone home, if you put [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=281.88s)]
*  it like that, but their houses aren't there. And so shelter is really, really important [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=287.55999999999995s)]
*  for people in the days and weeks to come. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=292.4s)]
*  And Nick, from the Israeli side, the hostage releases, some of the worst possible news [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=295.32s)]
*  coming for some families who have been waiting so long. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=301.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. I mean, we've got five weeks left of this initial phase of the ceasefire [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=306.32s)]
*  deal. There are 26 hostages who are due to be released in that time and the Israeli government [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=311.84s)]
*  saying yesterday that Hamas had given them information that eight of those 26 hostages [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  had died. It's worth pointing out that that figure had been reported quite widely in the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=324.56s)]
*  Israeli media over the past couple of weeks or so, but clearly for those families that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=329.52s)]
*  is confirmation, as best as they can have it at this moment, information coming from [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=334.72s)]
*  Hamas that their loved ones have been killed. As you were saying, the hostage exchange continues [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=338.92s)]
*  and what we'll see is on Thursday three more hostages being released and then another three [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=345.52s)]
*  at the weekend. And of course, at the same time, lots of Palestinian prisoners currently [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  in Israeli detention in Israeli prisons, they will be released as well. So this quite complicated [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  system, which of course took months to be arrived at, continues. And for now, despite [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=361.68s)]
*  this hiccup we saw at the weekend, it is progressing, Martin. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xp0zwpPG4&t=368.68s)]
