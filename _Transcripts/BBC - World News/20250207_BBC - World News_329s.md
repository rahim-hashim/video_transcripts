# Is Project 2025 shaping Donald Trump’s policy in the US? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4)
*  It's not even three weeks since President Trump's inauguration and we've seen a blizzard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=0.0s)]
*  of executive orders and a total reshaping of the way things are being done. Now in the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=4.4s)]
*  run-up to the election, Donald Trump battered away concerns that Project 2025, a conservative [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=9.88s)]
*  blueprint for dismantling federal government, could shape his second term. So where are [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  we? Well, Russell Vout, who's an architect of Project 2025, has just been confirmed to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  lead the White House Budget Office. President Trump has offered incentives to for federal [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=25.78s)]
*  workers to resign or face being laid off, a move that's being challenged in the courts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=31.04s)]
*  And the Department of Justice is trying to force the FBI to release the identities of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=36.660000000000004s)]
*  staff who investigated the January the 6th riots. A judge has ordered a halt to that, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=40.06s)]
*  saying there is no question that releasing the names would put FBI agents in significant [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=44.74s)]
*  and immediate dangers. Just a few of the things that are currently at play. Let's speak to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  Scott Lucas, a professor in American Studies at University College Dublin. Scott, welcome [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=55.42s)]
*  here to the programme. So as I said there, we're less than three weeks since the inauguration. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=60.18s)]
*  Where are we, do you think? Where we are, it needs to be stated clearly amidst all these [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=65.5s)]
*  dizzying news reports, is a systematic effort by Donald Trump and by Elon Musk to effectively [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=71.9s)]
*  take apart the U.S. government. And by take apart, I mean by closing certain departments [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=81.55999999999999s)]
*  and agencies without going through Congress, by firing thousands of personnel, by trying [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  to coerce or cajole thousands of others to resign, by shutting down entire federal programmes, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=94.8s)]
*  including the U.S. foreign aid programme, and by severely restricting the ability of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=101.96s)]
*  U.S. specialists in government to cooperate with colleagues around the world on health, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=106.68s)]
*  education, environment and other areas. I was reading an article by Edward Luce in the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  Financial Times today, whose first line was that Donald Trump is making good on his threats, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=118.36000000000001s)]
*  driving a cyber truck through the U.S. Constitution. From your answer, I suspect you agree with [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=124.64000000000001s)]
*  that basic assessment. In terms of Project 2025, how far down that road are we in less than the three weeks? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=130.84s)]
*  What's interesting is that this was in plain sight, that this intention to take apart the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=139.72s)]
*  agencies and bend under Trump's will was in Project 2025, even though he lied, he knew nothing about it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=144.2s)]
*  And they have gotten quite a way into doing that because they bypass the courts, they bypass Congress. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=150.52s)]
*  In other words, that U.S. system of checks and balances is gone. So to give you some extremes, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=157.8s)]
*  where are we already facing this? That is that the government services organization, which is supposed [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=163.0s)]
*  to oversee U.S. agencies, is effectively paralysed. They aren't able to operate because Musk and his [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=168.84s)]
*  people are going in, getting sensitive records, are issuing commands or emails, calling on people [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  to resign. The CIA is facing the unprecedented effort of having to hand over the names of its agents [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=183.08s)]
*  in an unclassified way, something that violates every principle of security [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=190.84s)]
*  because it's being demanded. And of course, we're looking at the FBI and the Justice Department [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  facing effectively a paralysis on any type of meaningful investigation, all because Donald Trump [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  and Elon Musk do not, well, they want retribution over the investigation of January the 6th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=205.24s)]
*  You mentioned a list and I've got a few more because Elon Musk, access to the payment details [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=210.12s)]
*  in the Treasury and of course that lead civil servant who's been there for decades, forced out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=216.44s)]
*  You have what I had mentioned about the FBI, you were talking about the CIA, the pushing or trying [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  to push out all those federal workers. When you see that array of all these different things going [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=227.48s)]
*  on, which is the thing that concerns you most? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  You could pick any one of those and talk about it being unprecedented and dangerous. Think about [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=235.72s)]
*  the idea of the records of almost every American being in the hands of men between 19 and 26 year [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=240.6s)]
*  old with no expertise, but who could find out about people's health record, about their payments [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=247.72s)]
*  records. Think about the fact that American national security is now compromised at a time [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=253.64s)]
*  of great international crisis. Think about the fact that entire health programs in the US and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=259.56s)]
*  abroad like HIV prevention programs are paralyzed, but put it all together, we are talking about the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=264.52s)]
*  attempt effectively to bring an autocracy into the United States and I know what that word means. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=271.56s)]
*  And by autocracy, I mean you can choose Donald Trump or you can choose the health of the US [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  system, you cannot choose both. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=282.52s)]
*  Just a sentence or two in terms of all those legal challenges that are currently in play, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=284.76s)]
*  do you see any prospect of them being able to hold the ring? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=289.8s)]
*  The problem with the legal challenges and they need to be broad is that unless the courts can [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  effectively stay, not just say that it is wrong what is happening, but that they can actually say [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=299.24s)]
*  there should be no further pursuit of records or of firings by the mosque people or by the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=305.08s)]
*  Trump people, they will try to operate, they will take all the time they can before the courts [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=311.8s)]
*  intervene and that could be weeks or even months. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=316.76s)]
*  Scott Lucas, we have to leave it there, but thanks for taking time to speak to us and thanks for that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=319.8s)]
*  analysis. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMeq64dDv4&t=324.12s)]
