*  The controversial influencer Andrew Tate has been accused of putting a gun in a woman's face. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=0.0s)]
*  In court documents seen by BBC News, four women are suing the self-proclaimed misogynist in the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=5.44s)]
*  High Court. Accusing him of rape or assault, Mr Tate denies all the women's claims, saying [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=10.56s)]
*  they are untrue and a pack of lies. Lucy Manning reports. Andrew Tate in the black hoodie, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=15.76s)]
*  accused in Romania of rape and trafficking, which he denies. But here in the UK, four women are [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=23.04s)]
*  suing him at the High Court, claiming he raped or assaulted them. Sienna Nother Realname has told [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=28.96s)]
*  the BBC why they've taken out a civil case. We want the public to know how kind of an evil [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  man he really is. A good result would be justice for our side and to be believed, I think, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=41.92s)]
*  to just be believed for everything we've said. Documents filed at the High Court have been seen [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  by the BBC. They set out the women's allegations from 2013 to 2015. Prosecutors here decided not [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=53.76s)]
*  to charge him. The documents claim he threatened one with a gun. On one occasion, putting a gun [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=61.92s)]
*  in her face, it says, and then pointing it at her while saying things like, I'm a boss, I'm a G, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=68.88s)]
*  you're going to do as I say, or they'll be held to pay. Another woman claims the defendant raped her. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=76.24s)]
*  She was crying. He had his hand around her neck. As she tried to tell him that she did not want [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=83.44s)]
*  him to do what he was doing, he would strangle her more forcefully. Sienna claims during sex, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=89.12s)]
*  the defendant strangled her to the point where she lost consciousness. She was not able to defend [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=96.32s)]
*  herself whilst being strangled. Andrew Tait in his 67-page defence submission claims the women [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=101.6s)]
*  can't sue him because too much time has passed and texts and emails will have been lost. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=109.76s)]
*  He also denies all the claims, calling them gross fabrications, a pack of lies, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=116.48s)]
*  and untrue. He claims all the sexual activity was consensual and he wasn't violent or controlling [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=123.76s)]
*  towards them. Andrew Tait also denies the claim he put a gun in one defendant's face. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=132.24s)]
*  Sienna also claims she saw a gun but didn't know if it was real. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  He says there may have been a toy gun in the house. There was a gun on his sofa. I didn't [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=142.96s)]
*  really mention it to him or anything but I distinctly remember it being there and kind of being [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=148.24s)]
*  a bit freaked out by it because it's not really something you see in the UK. On the other claims [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=152.72s)]
*  made by Sienna, his defence submission says they had consensual sex, the defendant did not pin her [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=158.08s)]
*  down or do anything violent, he did not strangle her or simulate strangulation. Andrew Tait has [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=164.88s)]
*  now been allowed by Romanian authorities to travel to other countries but Sienna wants him [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=171.84s)]
*  extradited. It's just horrible to see. It just makes you feel like maybe men feel like they can [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=176.88s)]
*  get away with anything. I think the UK should be pushing a lot harder. I think they've had an [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=183.04s)]
*  opportunity to do that and they haven't. Andrew Tait facing allegations in the UK, US and Romania. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdb1TKCClM&t=187.51999999999998s)]
