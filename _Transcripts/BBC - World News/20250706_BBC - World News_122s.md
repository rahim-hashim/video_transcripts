Video Description: Elon Musk says he is launching a new political party, weeks after dramatically falling out with US President Donald Trump.
 
The billionaire announced on his social media platform X that he had set up the America Party, billing it as a challenge to the Republican and Democratic two-party system.
 
However, it is unclear if the party has been formally registered with US election authorities. Musk, who was born outside of the US and is thus ineligible to run for the US presidency, does not say who will lead it.
 
He first raised the prospect of forming a party during his public feud with Trump, which saw him leave his role in the administration and engage in a vicious public spat with his former ally.

# Elon Musk says he is launching new political party | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [July 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8)
*  Now in the US, Elon Musk has announced he is launching a new party, the American Party, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=0.0s)]
*  to rival the Republicans in next year's midterm elections. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  This comes after President Donald Trump signed his tax cut and spending bill into law on [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=8.92s)]
*  Friday, which the billionaire had fiercely opposed. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=13.0s)]
*  Our North America correspondent, Aruna Day Mukherjee, has more from Washington. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=16.48s)]
*  Well, Elon Musk had said earlier on as well that if this tax and spending bill of President [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=20.16s)]
*  Donald Trump does pass, he will be floating a new political party. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=25.82s)]
*  And in line with that, on the 4th of July, that is America's independence, he put out [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=29.26s)]
*  a poll on his social networking website X in which he asked people, or rather his followers, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=33.22s)]
*  whether they wanted independence from America's two-party system. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  Now about a million plus people responded to that, and out of that 65% voted a yes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=42.58s)]
*  Now that is what prompted him to make this announcement. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=47.94s)]
*  It's very hard to assess whether this is kind of a large sentiment, whether there's enough [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=51.78s)]
*  appetite for actually a new political party to be formed in the country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=57.339999999999996s)]
*  That would be very hard to assess because this was in the end just a poll that was put [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=61.28s)]
*  out on the social networking site and to his followers. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=64.8s)]
*  But given the optics, that's what's most important. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=69.3s)]
*  This is Elon Musk who has repeatedly criticized Donald Trump's tax and spending bill. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=73.3s)]
*  He was the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency who said that the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=78.0s)]
*  Republicans who came to power and formed government based on promises that they would be reducing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=81.94s)]
*  spending are doing exactly the opposite with this bill. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=86.78s)]
*  So this is Elon Musk's attempt at perhaps testing waters to see what kind of reactions [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=89.8s)]
*  does this give out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=96.7s)]
*  So it remains to be seen how this is actually taken up. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=97.7s)]
*  Donald Trump in the past has responded and criticized Elon Musk as well, saying that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=100.2s)]
*  he's only opposing the bill because this would mean that he would lose incentives for his [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=104.12s)]
*  EVs. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=107.83999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk himself has said that, look, he's ideologically committed to the fact that he [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  wants to save money for America. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=112.52s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=115.16s)]
*  Very, very unclear. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=116.16s)]
*  We're still waiting for any kind of major political reactions to come in to his announcement. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WZktQlsFW8&t=117.16s)]
