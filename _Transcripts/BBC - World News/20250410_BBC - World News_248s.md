Video Description: A Russian-American citizen who was arrested for donating Â£39 to a US-based charity providing humanitarian support to Ukraine has been released in a prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington.
 
Amateur ballerina Ksenia Karelina, a Los Angeles resident, had been in prison in Russia for over a year after being found guilty for treason in Yekaterinburg and sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony.
 
Karelina was reportedly exchanged in Abu Dhabi for dual German-Russian citizen Arthur Petrov, who was arrested in Cyprus in 2023 and accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Russia for manufacturers working with the Russian military.

# Woman jailed in Russia over Ukraine charity donation freed in US prisoner swap | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw)
*  Now Russia and the US have carried out another prisoner swap. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=0.0s)]
*  Ksenia Karolina, a Russian-American dancer [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=4.0s)]
*  who was jailed by a Moscow court for donating [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=6.88s)]
*  to a Ukrainian charity, is on her way back to the US. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=9.68s)]
*  In return, the Americans have released [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=13.8s)]
*  a Russian-German national, Arthur Petrov. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=15.76s)]
*  The prisoner swap took place in Abu Dhabi early on Thursday. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=18.84s)]
*  Well, to get more on that story, let's go live to Moscow [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  and speak to our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=25.72s)]
*  So Steve, what's all this about? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=28.88s)]
*  Well, interestingly, a short while ago, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=33.68s)]
*  the Kremlin declined to comment on these reports. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=35.32s)]
*  But the FSB, Russia's domestic security service, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=38.04s)]
*  issued a statement basically confirming it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  So what do we know? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=43.64s)]
*  This prisoner swap, two people are involved. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=44.64s)]
*  So the Russians have released Ksenia Karolina, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=48.64s)]
*  who is a Russia-US dual national. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  She's a resident of Los Angeles, an amateur [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=55.4s)]
*  ballerina. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=59.72s)]
*  Last year, she came back to Russia to visit her family. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=60.72s)]
*  She was arrested. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  She was convicted of treason, her crime [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=64.32s)]
*  being that she donated around $50 to a US-based charity [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=68.16s)]
*  that supports Ukraine. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=72.28s)]
*  And she was sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=73.32s)]
*  So she's been freed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  The Russians have freed a Russian-German dual national, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=78.44s)]
*  Arthur Petrov. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=82.72s)]
*  He was arrested on Cyprus in 2023 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=84.68s)]
*  at the request of the Americans. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=88.48s)]
*  He was extradited to America. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=90.08s)]
*  He was accused of conspiring to ship sensitive US [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=92.28s)]
*  microelectronics to Russia. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=97.68s)]
*  So he's been freed by the Americans. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=100.84s)]
*  And I think this adds to the desire by both Moscow [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=104.56s)]
*  and Washington to kind of boost relations, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=110.56s)]
*  improve the atmosphere between Russia and America. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=112.84s)]
*  There are talks going on today in Istanbul, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=115.64s)]
*  diplomatic talks about improving the functioning [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=118.68s)]
*  of diplomatic missions, Russian and American. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  So you can see where this is leading. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=124.76s)]
*  Even though there's been very little progress in terms [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=128.4s)]
*  of ending the war in Ukraine, US and Russia, I think, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=131.0s)]
*  determined to do what they can to improve [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  their bilateral relations right now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=137.68s)]
*  Indeed, because this is the second prisoner swap [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=139.44s)]
*  between the two nations in as many months, isn't it, Steve? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=141.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=147.6s)]
*  Since Donald Trump returned to the White House, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=148.36s)]
*  the second such prisoner swap, I think, was in February, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  wasn't it, that we saw the American teacher, Mark Fogle, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=154.08s)]
*  who'd been in prison in Russia on drugs charges. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=158.44s)]
*  He was released. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=161.28s)]
*  Alexander Vinnick, who had been accused of cybercrime, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  I think, or convicted of cybercrime in America, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=168.68s)]
*  he came back to Russia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=171.56s)]
*  I mean, it's quite interesting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=174.0s)]
*  As I say, this is all about improving relations [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=175.48s)]
*  between Russia and America. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=178.44s)]
*  And yet, you do get the sense that Donald Trump [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=180.28s)]
*  has become frustrated at the lack of progress [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=183.12s)]
*  in terms of ending the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=185.88s)]
*  He's expressed frustration about what Russia's doing, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=189.4s)]
*  the continued bombing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=192.32s)]
*  And also, there's been a sense of frustration here in Russia [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=194.0s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=197.4s)]
*  Some of the headlines, actually, in the Russian papers [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=198.44s)]
*  in the last few days have been quite incredible. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=201.18s)]
*  I mean, there was one paper a couple of days [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=203.46s)]
*  ago that accused the Trump administration [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=205.62s)]
*  of administrative insanity. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  One paper yesterday said that Donald Trump was conducting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=210.34s)]
*  affairs chaotically and throwing pieces of complex jigsaw [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=213.38s)]
*  puzzles up in the air, hoping that when they come down [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=217.82s)]
*  on the ground, that they form some kind of rational picture. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=220.9s)]
*  So those are the kind of things that the Russian papers [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=224.4s)]
*  have been writing about Donald Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=226.62s)]
*  And yet, we see from the talks in Istanbul, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=228.26s)]
*  we see from the prisoner exchange [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=231.26s)]
*  that still Moscow and Washington seem [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=233.7s)]
*  committed to improving bilateral relations, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=236.66s)]
*  no matter what happens with the war in Ukraine. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=240.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's really interesting. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=243.62s)]
*  As always, we love to have you on. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=244.94s)]
*  Steve Rosenberg, our Russia editor. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Nv_VbyOEw&t=246.29999999999998s)]
