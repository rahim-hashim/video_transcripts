# Trump: 'We're building the wall anyway' - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40)
*  As I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=0.0s)]
*  Just so you know, we're building the wall anyway. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=8.4s)]
*  They say that progress has been made with this committee. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=12.8s)]
*  Just now, just now, I said, wait a minute, I got to take care of my people from Texas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=16.0s)]
*  I got to go. I don't even want to hear about it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=28.0s)]
*  I don't want to hear about it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=34.0s)]
*  So I don't know what they mean, progress is being made significant. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=36.4s)]
*  Now, what did happen is the Democrats were being hit really hard on the concept of releasing criminals into our society. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=40.0s)]
*  That has not been playing well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  So maybe progress has been made, maybe not. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  But I had a choice. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=52.8s)]
*  I could have stayed out there and listened, or I could have come out to the people of El Paso and Texas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=54.2s)]
*  I chose you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwfL-PPD40&t=62.2s)]
