# President Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukraine ready to work on peace deal | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU)
*  Hello and welcome to BBC News. Let's start with that breaking news. It is an important [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=0.0s)]
*  development in the Ukraine war because President Zelensky has said that Ukraine is ready to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=5.08s)]
*  come to the negotiating table as soon as possible. This is what he posted just a few minutes [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=11.48s)]
*  ago. He says he and his team are ready to work under what he describes as President [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=17.6s)]
*  Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. He says the first stages to end the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=22.56s)]
*  war could be the release of prisoners and a truce in the sky and on the sea if Russia [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=28.48s)]
*  does the same. President Zelensky regretted, he said, the way the meeting in the Oval Office [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=33.52s)]
*  went on Friday and that it was time to make things right. And he said Ukraine was ready [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  to sign the Minerals and Security Agreement. Let's go straight to Washington, straight [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=44.36s)]
*  to our correspondent Tom Bateman. And Tom, well, this is President Zelensky trying to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=49.16s)]
*  put things right. I assume there hasn't been any sort of reaction there, but significant [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=55.32s)]
*  in terms of the climb down on just about everything. Well, I think there's some very significant [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=61.24s)]
*  language in that statement, not least mentioning President Trump twice, echoing really some [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=68.08s)]
*  of the talking points that Mr. Trump himself likes to emphasise. I think it's particularly [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=74.44s)]
*  notable that President Zelensky talks about the Javelin anti-tank missiles that President [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=78.92s)]
*  Trump had authorised during his first term for Ukraine. It's something he often talks [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=85.08s)]
*  about. And here you have Mr. Zelensky sort of echoing his gratitude for that as being [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=89.16s)]
*  a sort of key starting point and saying that he is ready to sign this Minerals Agreement. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=94.32s)]
*  Now, he had said over the weekend that he was ready to sign it. And indeed, clearly, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=99.64s)]
*  he was ready to sign it when he came to the White House because they had organised this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=103.68s)]
*  mutual or joint signing ceremony that was supposed to happen after a working lunch after [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=107.84s)]
*  that meeting in the Oval Office, after which Mr. Zelensky was rather unceremoniously ejected [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=113.44s)]
*  from the White House. But here you have, I think, both in sort of tone and the specifics [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=120.64s)]
*  of what he is talking about here, an attempt to try to rebuild this after the intense pressure [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=126.6s)]
*  that the White House has been putting on, culminating in the form of President Trump [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=133.0s)]
*  last night deciding that he would cease or pause, in their language, military assistance [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=137.96s)]
*  to Ukraine. So a huge amount of arm twisting of President Zelensky going on here by the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=143.12s)]
*  Trump administration. And this feels like the sort of attempt at a response. The question, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=149.16s)]
*  as you say, is whether or not it will be enough. I assume also, and it is an assumption, that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=153.8s)]
*  everything that the White House has announced about the pause would effectively stay in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=159.36s)]
*  place until all of this has actually happened. Well, I think so, because clearly Mr. Trump [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=164.84s)]
*  is trying to use that pause as a way to leverage Mr. Zelensky to do what he wants. I have to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=172.6s)]
*  say, there are sort of two things going on here, and it is hard to know which the administration [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=180.4s)]
*  wants Mr. Zelensky to respond to the most. One is about signing the deal and about basically [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=184.44s)]
*  signing up to a quick ceasefire that Mr. Trump wants, but without security guarantees. Now, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=190.88s)]
*  Mr. Zelensky references that right at the end of his statement. He says he sees the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  agreement or the minerals agreement as a path towards these security guarantees. He was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=201.84s)]
*  saying something a bit similar again on Friday, so it is not a radical change in the message [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=207.12s)]
*  he is giving, but I think the fact he is emphasising that he will sign this without security guarantees [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=211.52s)]
*  at the moment, but still expects them or hopes for them or needs them in the future. But [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=217.36s)]
*  the other thing is about really the sort of emotive element of this. Remember, Mr. Zelensky [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=222.08s)]
*  was humiliated by the administration in the Oval Office. He was told that he was ungrateful, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=227.56s)]
*  even though he has said thank you dozens of times to the US over its military assistance, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  and told that he was disrespectful. So that adds another dimension to this. It is a bit [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=240.88000000000002s)]
*  harder to see if this will be enough and how he comes back from that. We had really more [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=245.96s)]
*  insults from key members of the administration towards Mr. Zelensky overnight, with Jason [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=250.52s)]
*  Miller, a key advisor to President Trump, referencing what he called Mr. Zelensky's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=256.0s)]
*  track suit, saying that he needs to stop goofing around. This was something he said overnight, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=262.0s)]
*  saying that that behaviour needs to stop. Also, Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, talking [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=268.36s)]
*  about Mr. Zelensky in the sense that he said he needs to basically sign this agreement [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=274.4s)]
*  and expecting him to sort of respect President Trump, say that he loves America. So that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  element of things is a bit harder to determine because there was a huge diplomatic breakdown [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=290.4s)]
*  clearly, and they're sort of expecting some will see Mr. Zelensky to basically grovel [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=295.28s)]
*  to get relations back on track. So we'll have to see now over the coming hours, we've [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=301.44s)]
*  got this key speech in Congress from Mr. Trump tonight, how he responds to this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=305.76s)]
*  Tom, thanks very much. As you were finishing that answer, we were seeing the pictures from [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=310.04s)]
*  the weekend with President Zelensky meeting Keir Starmer. Let me also tell you that the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=314.28s)]
*  Prime Minister, we have heard, had a call with President Zelensky this afternoon. Downing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=319.36s)]
*  Street said that more discussions and details are expected shortly, but it is safe to assume [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=325.96s)]
*  that Keir Starmer used as the bridge to try to repair the damage of Friday after that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=333.32s)]
*  London summit, trying to bolster European support for President Zelensky, but try to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=341.28s)]
*  repair the damage between Ukraine's president and America's president. So we wait for more [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  details of that Downing Street call, but let's talk to Carl Bildt, who's the former Prime [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=351.96s)]
*  Minister of Sweden. Carl, welcome back to the programme. Just your headline thought, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=358.08s)]
*  these are lines that have just come in in the last five, 10 minutes, your snapshot judgement [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=364.28s)]
*  on what you're hearing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=369.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, what happened in the announcement coming out of the US is, of course, stabbing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=371.0s)]
*  the back of Ukraine, ceasing or pausing military supplies. The purpose or the aim is, of course, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=377.04s)]
*  to weaken Ukraine so that Ukraine can then be forced into submission to demands coming [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  in from the White House or demands coming from perhaps a deal that Trump is going to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  do with President Putin. So it is serious. It's a stab in the back. The purpose is to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=395.92s)]
*  weaken Ukraine. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DedP5GyfU&t=403.08000000000004s)]
