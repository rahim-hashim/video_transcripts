*  pours military aid to Ukraine, Russia continued to attack. On that Friday, Donald Trump accused [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=6.44s)]
*  President Zelensky of gambling with World War III, of not being ready for peace. This [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=12.32s)]
*  week there's been no such criticism of Putin. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  And hours after Zelensky's White House meeting, there were Russian strikes in Kharkiv. A medical [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=20.44s)]
*  facility was damaged, patients were evacuated, a child was among the injured. On Saturday, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=25.02s)]
*  Russia struck a military training ground in eastern Ukraine. Local reports say 32 people [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=31.22s)]
*  died. Russia claims it was five times more. Then, on Tuesday evening in Washington, President [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=35.9s)]
*  Trump said of Russia, the US had received strong signals that they're ready for peace. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=42.06s)]
*  Also on Tuesday, Russia struck the city of Odessa. Officials say a 77-year-old man was [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  killed by shrapnel and parts of the city were left without heat, power and water. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=52.86s)]
*  Lest there was any doubt, on Wednesday, a key Putin ally posted that inflicting maximum [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=58.78s)]
*  defeat on the enemy on the ground remains our main task today. Hours later, a strike [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  on a hotel in President Zelensky's hometown killed four people. This footage shows emergency [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  services at the scene. And there's been no let up. Thursday night brought a huge series [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  of Russian attacks. Ukraine says energy infrastructure was targeted and that 18 people, including [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=80.62s)]
*  four children, were wounded. This was the first attack of this scale since America [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=86.38000000000001s)]
*  stopped sharing intelligence. Also through the week, Ukraine struck oil facilities inside [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=91.42s)]
*  Russian territory. And on the front line, it continued its resistance as Russia continues [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=96.98s)]
*  to slowly take territory. America may have fundamentally changed its approach to this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=102.58000000000001s)]
*  war, but Russia hasn't. Ukraine says there have been nearly 19,000 drone strikes in the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=107.54s)]
*  last week, most near the front line. This map of Ukraine shows the regions affected [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=112.9s)]
*  by Russian attacks in the last week. Watching recent developments, Russian media has welcomed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=117.78s)]
*  the new American approach. The head of a state broadcaster declared Trump has shown himself [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=123.94s)]
*  to be a sane person. On Friday, the president took to social media, posting, based on the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=128.5s)]
*  fact that Russia is absolutely pounding Ukraine, I'm strongly considering large scale banking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=135.26s)]
*  sanctions, sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire. He added, to Russia and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=140.06s)]
*  Ukraine, get to the table right now. Also this past week, the funerals in Ukraine have [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=146.26s)]
*  continued, including those of the journalist Tetiana Kulik and the surgeon Pavlo Ivanchov. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=151.94s)]
*  Both were killed in a drone strike in the Kiev region two days before Zelensky's meeting [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  at the White House. Russia's attacks are a constant. America's support for Ukraine can [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=162.9s)]
*  no longer be described that way. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3x9ZKw0ldg&t=169.08s)]
