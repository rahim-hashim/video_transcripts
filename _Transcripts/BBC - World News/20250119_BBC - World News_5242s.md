Video Description: The long-awaited ceasefire in the war in Gaza has come into force after a delay of nearly three hours, and Gazans are beginning to return to their homes

The first three Israeli female hostages are expected to be freed later.

The ceasefire was due to start at 08:30 (06:30 GMT) on Sunday but was delayed last-minute after Hamas failed to give Israel the list of the three hostages in time - Hamas says it was due to "technical field reasons"

*  of UNRWA stands, its staff are working and they have been working all these months and have been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=0.0s)]
*  critical in the delivery not only of the humanitarian supplies but also think of the online learning that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5.44s)]
*  200,000 children in Gaza today are in one form or another able to enjoy. These are critical areas [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=11.76s)]
*  of work where only UNRWA over the decades of its mandate has delivered. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=19.44s)]
*  Finally Sigrid Kog, before we let you go, as you know feeding the people has tragically been a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=24.72s)]
*  political football in this war. Before you leave us, how do you define the extent of the humanitarian [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=31.44s)]
*  crisis now in Gaza as this ceasefire has finally started? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=40.16s)]
*  I'm not sure if I have words or I could find the definition. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=46.64s)]
*  I've often described it as inhumane conditions and beyond catastrophic, so not a second to waste I would say. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=51.04s)]
*  Thank you Sigrid Kog, the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, also the Senior [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator. Thank you very much for joining us on BBC News, giving [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=66.08s)]
*  us more details about what they expect to happen as part of the UNRWA's response to the crisis. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=72.48s)]
*  The UNRWA is part of the stepping up of urgently needed humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=79.52s)]
*  This is a crucial part of the process and my colleague Anna Foster who's in Tel Aviv is with [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  us now and we've heard so many times before that the aid will be delivered. Sigrid Kog seems to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  underline that this time there is a better chance and of course it's an integral part [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=97.6s)]
*  of what is meant to be a whole new phase in this punishing war which now of course is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=102.32s)]
*  in a ceasefire. How long it will last is of course the biggest question of all. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=108.64s)]
*  Yeah and such interesting I think an important insight as well as you say, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=116.32s)]
*  is just to really hear that you know in depth to go through all of the various things that have [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=120.48s)]
*  happened already and the complexity and the difficulty of what is to come and as you were [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=125.36s)]
*  saying there this particular agreement it is multifaceted. There are lots of different things [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=129.84s)]
*  that are part of it. One is as we were discussing there the idea of more aid moving into Gaza and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=135.76s)]
*  of course one of the key elements that will happen today here in Israel is the release of hostages. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=141.68s)]
*  Now I've been talking to you all morning all day so far from this part of Tel Aviv which is now [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=146.72s)]
*  known as Hostages Square. You'll be able to hear actually in the background the sound of a piano [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=151.84s)]
*  being played which happens very often and it sort of creates a surprisingly peaceful and tranquil [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=156.32s)]
*  atmosphere which actually when you consider the very high emotional torment of many people that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=163.52s)]
*  come and go through this square it is a real contrast and you know always there behind us is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=171.12s)]
*  the the number of days and hours that people have been without their loved ones 470 days so far. Now [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=176.0s)]
*  we've got those three names of hostages who are going to be released today. One of them [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=184.8s)]
*  is Emily Demary. She is a British Israeli hostage and a source close to her family has said just [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=189.44s)]
*  let me tell you a little of what she says. All Emily's mum Mandy wants to do is hug Emily but [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=196.08s)]
*  she won't believe it until she sees it. It's been a torturous 471 days but a particularly torturous [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=200.56s)]
*  24 hours. Again just referring to the need I think for that ceasefire to come in and particularly the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=207.2s)]
*  delay that we saw this morning until she's out and Mandy can actually see that she's out. It hasn't [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=211.92s)]
*  happened until it happens it's not done until it's done and there's a long road ahead. So that is a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=217.52s)]
*  source very close to the Demary family speaking to the BBC and we've been hearing as well this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  morning the stories of those people who are waiting to be reunited with their loved ones and one of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=228.4s)]
*  them is with me now. Harut Nimrodi. Harut thank you for joining us. I think it says a lot that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  that family members like you you know you still come out here you still speak to people like me [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=240.24s)]
*  you still you know you still don't know what's happened to Tamir so let's talk about him. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=246.0s)]
*  Tell us about him and tell us what happened to him on the 7th of October. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=251.68s)]
*  Well Tamir was taken when he was 18 years old he's an IDF soldier [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  but his unit actually he's it's Kogut which deals with humanitarian issues of the Palestinians in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=263.76s)]
*  Gaza so ironically he was taken early that morning. He managed to text me that morning [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=270.88s)]
*  asking me if I was okay he had no idea the terrorist was already inside his base while he [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=280.4s)]
*  was texting me and I asked him to take good care of himself and text me whenever he can [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=286.48s)]
*  and 20 minutes afterwards he was brutally taken by Hamas terrorists. The way we found out was [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=293.92s)]
*  through my youngest daughter she was 14 at the time and she came to me around four o'clock that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=301.12s)]
*  Saturday screaming that she's seeing her brother being abducted over the Instagram and she came [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  to me with this video where I saw my son hiding his face scared with his pajamas he was barefoot [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=314.48s)]
*  he had no glasses on and he was terrified and those were [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=324.8s)]
*  this is the last footage of him being led into Gaza [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=333.12s)]
*  while a terrorist is holding his neck and dragging him over the concrete walls into Gaza [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=337.6s)]
*  and this is the last footage of him. And I think it's important for people watching to know that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=344.8s)]
*  you don't receive updates you know you don't you don't have anything anything at all to let you know [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  how he is where he is what his condition might be it's just silence isn't it nothing at all. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  It's just silence I spoke with the president of the Red Cross and she said there's no way for us [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=364.0s)]
*  to get in and check on the hostages because Hamas won't let us and so here I am with no clue what [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=373.04s)]
*  happened to my son if he's being bullied or he gets food or sunlight or if he even still alive [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=382.32s)]
*  I have no idea. And I said right at the start that these conversations every time you tell the story [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=394.32s)]
*  it hurts but it's important for you to keep telling the story to keep Tamir's picture as you can see [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=400.72s)]
*  there his name to keep that out there so people don't forget about him and the others who are being [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=407.2s)]
*  that is true I owe it to Tamir and I owe it to my daughters that looks at me every day and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=412.32s)]
*  needs to see me fighting for Tamir and for them for their future. I don't know what is going to be [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  next as as the hostages will return and there will be fewer in captivity we are very scared that we [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=428.32s)]
*  will lose the support of the public and it's really necessary that everybody will stick with [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=437.44s)]
*  us till the end till the last one is home. And we've been talking about those 33 hostages that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=445.44s)]
*  are due to be released in this first phase but it's particular groups of people and sadly Tamir [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=451.84s)]
*  being a soldier being on duty at that time you know that these these next six weeks will not [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=457.52s)]
*  include him you know that already so there's that extra pressure for you for things to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=463.2s)]
*  to go well the things to keep moving forward. Of course this is not the deal we hope for [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=467.6s)]
*  we really wanted to see even though it's it could be a phase a few phases but still to have a done [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=473.6s)]
*  deal with everything agreed in the beginning would be much easier for us to go through but when we [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=480.24s)]
*  know that that only on the 16th day they will start discussing the details of the second phase [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=486.8s)]
*  it's it's really scary for us not knowing if we will see our children back home who will survive [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=493.12s)]
*  who would last that long we have no idea. I know it's enormously difficult and I thank you for [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=499.12s)]
*  for telling us about Tamir once again thank you very much for being with us here in in [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  Hostages Fire thank you so much. In Tel Aviv and those are stories that we we hear and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=511.12s)]
*  have reflected on a lot as you were saying in the last 470 days or so always difficult to tell but [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=516.56s)]
*  I think it's it's something that these families have have made a really concerted effort to do [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=522.56s)]
*  to make sure that those those pictures those images and you see it around the square here in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=528.16s)]
*  Tel Aviv you there are posters of those individuals that have been here for the whole of the last 15 [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  months you know those pictures have really been burned into the public consciousness here in [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=539.52s)]
*  Israel you see them when you arrive at the airport you see them on billboards here in Tel Aviv you [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  see them absolutely everywhere you go and and it is not something that's ever forgotten here in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel that you know the situation with the hostages is is always there it is always at front of mind [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=555.6s)]
*  and on a day like today where we saw that delay in the ceasefire this morning we know how difficult [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=560.64s)]
*  it's been for those families and as we were saying Emily Damari's family is speaking to the BBC and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=565.12s)]
*  just really explaining how enormously difficult it is at a moment like this and until they actually [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=572.16s)]
*  until they actually have her back with them you know they just have absolutely no idea at all [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  whether that will whether that will happen whether that next stage of the of the agreement will push [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=586.64s)]
*  through whether things will happen the way that they are supposed to so while we're continuing to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=591.92s)]
*  bring you coverage of this story through the day and as we were saying there are various elements [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=598.56s)]
*  to what will happen today the release of Israeli hostages also much later on today we expect [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=602.16s)]
*  it will be probably into the evening the release also of Palestinian prisoners who are being held [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  in Israeli jails around 90 or so of them we expect to be released from Ofer prison in the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=613.92s)]
*  occupied West Bank we're told that of that 90 or so the majority will be women around probably 15 [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=620.4s)]
*  teenagers and 10 men but again that is a list of names which has been agreed and decided upon [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=626.4s)]
*  by Hamas and Israel I'm going to say in consultation but but you know the crucial [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=634.0s)]
*  underlying context of that is the consultation all goes through mediators they are not direct [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=639.12s)]
*  discussions that ever happened between Israel and Hamas you were hearing about the Qatari side of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=644.56s)]
*  things the Egyptian side of things and also crucially the US side of things as well and the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=649.28s)]
*  way that that momentum from the incoming president Donald Trump many people think has really pushed [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=655.2s)]
*  this ceasefire agreement to where we are just now let's talk about the situation for people [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=660.4000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza as well who many of whom are hoping to start to return home today and many of whom are [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=666.24s)]
*  hoping that the start of a more significant amount of humanitarian aid will start to move into Gaza [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=672.1600000000001s)]
*  let's hear from Medecins Sans Frontières in Gaza Dr Mohamed Abu Mugassab joins us now doctor thank [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=678.88s)]
*  you for being with us just explain to us if you would because I think for many people it is it [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=686.08s)]
*  is almost impossible to imagine the conditions in Gaza imagine the difficulty for civilians living [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=691.92s)]
*  there what have you been seeing and witnessing in your work there I mean first of all that's [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=698.16s)]
*  good news today that the ceasefire has been claimed at least I mean but 470 days we were [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=706.48s)]
*  calling to for this ceasefire which is was too late I mean there is massive destruction in Gaza [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=714.96s)]
*  if you are in Gaza you will see the massive destruction you see your population of 1.9 [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=722.0s)]

*  from from more basic injuries as well from from lack of food from lack of water lack of sanitation [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=856.16s)]
*  all of those things have had a huge medical impact as well haven't they I mean during this 470 days [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean all the health structure was totally destroyed I mean it was all the hospitals [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=872.88s)]
*  partially destroyed or totally destroyed clinics everywhere so I mean we saw some [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=879.76s)]
*  pathological diseases that has been not before 7th October I mean the malnutrition the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=886.8s)]

*  mean now since 400 days they are here a lot of them have died because there is no chemotherapy [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=904.0s)]
*  there is no treatment so I mean the the there is a huge need to rebuild and to develop now the in [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=909.9200000000001s)]
*  the coming days the health structure [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=919.36s)]

*  who's with Medecins Sans Frontieres in Gaza we can talk to our correspondent Jonah Fisher who is [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=926.88s)]
*  in Israel Jonah you are at one of the medical facilities where we believe that those released [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=932.72s)]
*  three hostages when that time comes will be taken to and treated later on today [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=940.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah that's right Anna I'm at the Shiba hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv the officials here [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=944.4s)]
*  are pretty sure that this is going to be the end destination for the hospital for the hostages if [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  they need medical treatment I don't know if you can see behind me but they're certainly [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=956.64s)]
*  starting to put the barriers up around the place because they are expecting lots of people [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=961.4399999999999s)]
*  potentially to come down here to the hospital as you can see the hospital is closed and the [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=965.28s)]
*  hospital as you said it's not going to be until 4 p.m local time that's two gmt that we are expecting [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=973.12s)]
*  the hostages to be handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross in Gaza they will then we are told be given [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=980.4000000000001s)]
*  to the IDF the Israeli Israeli Defense Force taken across the border into Israel where their [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  needs will be assessed and then more than likely they will be flown by helicopter to this hospital [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=992.72s)]
*  and then brought in to receive medical treatment and quite possibly this will also be the place [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1000.56s)]
*  where they're reunited with their families [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1005.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah that's a really key moment Jonah isn't it last time around when we saw hostages released [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1010.2399999999999s)]
*  during the ceasefire and we often saw you know those those very heartwarming moments here in [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1014.88s)]
*  Israel where families were reunited finally with with their loved ones [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1021.52s)]
*  Yeah and I think it's important to say that this might be different you know that earlier [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1026.32s)]
*  hostage release in November of 2023 came you know just a month or so after the hostages were taken [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1030.96s)]
*  we're now 15 months in who knows what conditions that these three women who will be released today [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1037.84s)]
*  if all goes according to plan are in there were reports that two of them had been injured at the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1046.56s)]
*  point when they were taken by Hamas so it's unlikely to be well it's not going to be I think [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1052.32s)]
*  we can say pretty clearly it's not going to be a public reuniting with the family I think [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1059.6799999999998s)]
*  almost all of the journey of the hostages out of Gaza to this hospital and then probably inside [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1065.4399999999998s)]
*  this hospital will take will be taking place outside public view I think Israel is very [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  mindful of the fact that these women will have had quite a quite frankly awful time [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1078.48s)]
*  in Gaza for the last 15 months they may have serious medical needs and they will need [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1083.28s)]
*  privacy both of them and their families to come to terms with it and to receive the treatment that they need [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1088.64s)]
*  Yeah Jonah thank you we'll keep in touch Jonah Fisher at the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1096.24s)]
*  Sheba hospital not too far just in the suburbs here in Tel Aviv and as he was saying there as well [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1099.6s)]
*  it's worth making that point that when those reunions actually happen those videos that we [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1104.24s)]
*  very often see of those moments of reunion are filmed by the Israeli government and distributed [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1111.28s)]
*  to broadcasters they do sort of make a point in those early hours and days of sort of giving [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1117.44s)]
*  people those privacy but also satisfying the you know the need actually here in Israel when [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1122.4s)]
*  the you know the need actually here in Israel when people are released you know people they [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  appreciate they put a lot of stock in those moments of hope so that there's often you know [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1135.1200000000001s)]
*  efforts that go on to actually to put that out there in the public consciousness so that people [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1139.1200000000001s)]
*  can see those those reunions starting to happen and starting to take place let's bring out our [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  world affairs editor John Simpson John it's always good to talk to you thank you for joining us [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1148.8s)]
*  Um this is a it's not in any way sadly an unprecedented moment is it it is the latest [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1155.12s)]
*  chapter in a a very very long book when it comes to this conflict here in the middle east [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1161.28s)]
*  Absolutely I mean I've been reporting on this kind of thing since the 1970s and even in the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1167.12s)]
*  1970s it was a an old long-running story um I was trying to work out how many people have had [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1175.6799999999998s)]
*  Nobel prizes peace prizes for having quote sorted out the situation I mean so a lot of people it's [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1185.12s)]
*  more than more than half a dozen um and yet of course we're as far from peace I would say [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1193.9199999999998s)]
*  actually possibly even farther uh than at any stage we've been I mean the bitterness the anger [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1201.6799999999998s)]
*  on both sides is absolutely intense and without some kind of willingness on one side or the other [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1208.72s)]
*  to give ground to accept the um the presence of of the other uh as as a legitimate [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1217.8400000000001s)]
*  neighbor um you're not going to get peace so this is yes I mean we've all got to be grateful [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1226.16s)]
*  that after such a long time more than 400 days uh we've the guns and the missiles and the [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1234.0s)]
*  and the bombs have gone silent of course they were still flying this morning and more people [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1243.2s)]
*  died even in that short space of of time this morning but that we've got to be grateful for [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1249.28s)]
*  that of course and this chapter may actually be coming to an end but that's all it is it's just [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1256.56s)]
*  another chapter and of course on part of the difficulty is that when we we talk about [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1264.48s)]
*  peace which is quite a generic sounding concept one of the great issues here in the Middle East [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1272.96s)]
*  is that is that peace you know a sustainable future looks very different depending on who you are [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1277.68s)]
*  yes yes precisely that um I think we do need to work out uh it's perhaps too early to be [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1284.4s)]
*  definitive about it but who's who's the winner here who's the loser um Hamas of course are [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1292.64s)]
*  claiming that they've won um it's not difficult to make out a case for saying that Israel has [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1300.0s)]
*  Israel has done enormous damage to its enemies both Hamas and Hezbollah and [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1307.68s)]
*  at a distance Iran uh nevertheless um the the question remains very strong of [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1315.28s)]
*  whether Israel has done what it promised well what what uh Prime Minister Netanyahu promised [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1326.24s)]
*  to eradicate Hamas and one of the most interesting things I thought recently was [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1333.6799999999998s)]
*  that the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken now just out of a out of a job of course um warned [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1339.9199999999998s)]
*  Israel that American intelligence told them that uh the Hamas's had replaced all of those what [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1347.36s)]
*  17 000 fighters that it had lost in the in the in the bombing and that Hamas's numbers at any rate [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  were up to what they had been before [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1366.0s)]
*  and of course John there's something about this this region as well where it is is such a [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1372.24s)]
*  you know a confluence a tying together of geopolitics in different parts of the world [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1376.8s)]
*  you know when we we widen things up we talk about the US support for Israel or we talk about the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1381.68s)]
*  impact that the Russians have had in in Syria until very recently you know wherever you are [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1387.3600000000001s)]
*  in the world you know often those those channels those rivers they flow and they they come together [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1392.5600000000002s)]
*  in sometimes unexpected ways here in the Middle East yeah very nicely put yes exactly that is what [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1397.6000000000001s)]
*  what has always been there I mean sometimes the players are different um Iran has only assumed [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1405.12s)]
*  real prominence in the last well 10 12 years and serious uh influence in the last six years um [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1413.68s)]
*  but when we talk about the Middle East you know I mean it's such a such a uh a kind of an easy [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1424.48s)]
*  expression to use and it's perhaps the necessary one but we are really talking about Israel and [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1431.44s)]
*  the Palestinians and what's happened here is that both sides have become fiercer and more hostile [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1438.48s)]
*  than I think really at any time over the last 50 years and the there's a a personal bitterness [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1449.8400000000001s)]
*  about it with many many people on both sides a real anger a sense of having been damaged and [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1459.52s)]
*  um and seriously affected by the actions of the other side [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1468.72s)]
*  John while while you're here you're also a very good person to talk to about how characters [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1477.84s)]
*  individual characters often leaders have such a big part to play in this the sort of person that [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1483.12s)]
*  you have been interviewing for decades it often uh the the turn of things like ceasefire agreements [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1488.8s)]
*  or alliances or wars often come down to the decisions made by by one or two individuals in [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1495.36s)]
*  power absolutely absolutely right um and we we did it's not just the Middle East I mean you know [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1501.84s)]
*  the decision to invade um uh Ukraine was made essentially by one man by by Vladimir Putin [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1509.12s)]
*  in this case of course it's it it is different um but we're talking about a decision which was a [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1518.56s)]
*  long time in the making of preparations for the Hamas attack of the 7th of October 2023 [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1526.8s)]
*  um knowing uh I suspect the reaction that it would create such a huge attack uh as that would [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1535.28s)]
*  create within Israel absolutely unquestionable that Israel would react with great anger and [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1546.48s)]
*  really really hard and Hamas is I mean it's very difficult to know about the inner workings of [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1554.8s)]
*  something like Hamas uh or or Iran behind it but I suspect the feeling was that um it would it would [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1562.48s)]
*  trick Israel into uh doing the kind of thing that would lose it international support and [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1572.72s)]
*  whatever about the situation on the ground whatever about uh the uh the the future of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1582.16s)]
*  Gaza and the future of uh any kind of of hostility between the Palestinians and Israel [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1590.64s)]
*  the fact is that Israel's response to the 7th of October attacks have lost it support uh really [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1598.24s)]
*  right across the world now Israelis would say I mean Israeli friends of mine would say well [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1607.76s)]
*  where is it where does it get us anyway having having the friendship of uh of of nations but [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1613.6s)]
*  it does it does affect things and my feeling is that from henceforth Israel will be um more much [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1620.6399999999999s)]
*  more bound in by uh the hostility of other countries it's now I mean it'll be impossible [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1630.08s)]
*  for Prime Minister Netanyahu to uh to travel through large parts of Europe and other parts [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1636.72s)]
*  of the of the world because of the International Criminal Court uh investigation into his uh [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1643.68s)]
*  involvement in all of this and I think Israel will find itself much more circumscribed uh in [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1651.3600000000001s)]
*  future as a result of this and that is a sort of in a way of a very negative uh success for Hamas [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1659.04s)]
*  but nevertheless it is a a sort of success [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1666.24s)]
*  John always always valuable to get your uh your thoughts your insights on these things thank you [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1672.56s)]
*  for joining us John Simpson there our world affairs editor I just want to uh replay you [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1676.96s)]
*  a press conference which happened a little earlier um this is Gideon Sa Israel's foreign minister [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1682.96s)]
*  and he was speaking after that ceasefire finally came into effect a quarter past 11 local time [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1689.1200000000001s)]
*  this morning reflecting on some of the stumbling blocks early this morning and also what might [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1694.72s)]
*  happen next any agreement with the terror organization is a bad event releasing terrorists [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1698.48s)]
*  from our jails is a heavy price with risks and there are also other dimensions including risks [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1708.72s)]
*  uh we are facing as you know uh we had uh this Friday [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1720.0s)]
*  a very serious debate in the government meeting [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1734.08s)]
*  one of the factions as you know quit from the government there is a public debate [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1738.88s)]
*  uh I don't undermine the arguments of those who oppose [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1744.64s)]
*  the framework for the release of the hostages eventually we are doing it because of our [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1753.76s)]
*  commitment to our brothers and sisters who are under captivity from over than 15 months already [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1761.44s)]
*  and we will do our utmost to release them [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1774.88s)]
*  we hadn't changed our minds on the conditions of the framework for the release of the hostages [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1781.68s)]
*  Hamas did and at least through major issues [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1788.48s)]
*  it's not us that says not only us that they were not ready for a hostage deal before it is [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1793.76s)]
*  secretary of state Blinken John Kirby Jake Sullivan all of them said it explicitly [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1804.8s)]
*  and I believe the reason is the huge achievements of Israel during its war [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1813.76s)]
*  achievements of Israel during its war that had changed the regional reality [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1820.72s)]
*  I want to thank our American friends both administrations the outgoing administration [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1830.48s)]
*  president Biden's administration and the in-going administration Trump's administration [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1838.72s)]
*  for their huge efforts during the last weeks in order to reach this agreement [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1846.24s)]
*  I want to make it clear Israel is committed to achieve and the government of Israel is committed [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1859.28s)]
*  to achieve all the goals all the objectives of the war that the security cabinet determined [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1866.48s)]
*  that includes the return of all our hostages [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1881.1200000000001s)]
*  the dismantle of Hamas governmental and military capabilities [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1886.16s)]
*  and to make sure that the Gaza Strip will not be a threat to the state of Israel and to its citizens [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1896.4s)]
*  this war could have ended long ago if Hamas would have laid down its weapons and [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1906.96s)]
*  hand over our hostages [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1919.52s)]
*  that is Gideon Sa' Israel's foreign minister speaking at a press conference a little earlier [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1921.92s)]
*  on this morning he was taking some questions as well very much focused on the delay to that [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1927.3600000000001s)]
*  ceasefire talking about why how it was resolved but also looking ahead to the rest of this process [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1934.56s)]
*  as we were saying you know today is is one day at the beginning of phase one of a three phase [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1940.48s)]
*  process which will last ultimately once you get to phase three in the reconstruction of Gaza [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1946.4s)]
*  something that will last for years let's get some reaction shall we because that ceasefire as we've [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1950.16s)]
*  been reporting here on BBC News all day was supposed to start at 8 30 local time it eventually happened [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1956.48s)]
*  nearly three hours later 11 15 was when it was officially formally declared so let's get the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1962.64s)]
*  thoughts of people in Jerusalem the hostages have to come back and we have to get them back [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1968.96s)]
*  the hostages have to come back it's a very very difficult deal [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1975.04s)]
*  lots of terrorists are being released and it's terrible but we have no option [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1978.48s)]
*  and another thing is that it's not such a great deal for us either i'm just praying that most of [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1982.48s)]
*  the hostages come home alive please god and that this suffering ends here we release killers they [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1988.08s)]
*  will come back to kill we know it for sure and we are it's very hard what we are doing and it's very [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=1996.16s)]
*  hard we're dealing with the terrorists they're cheating us every time again and again and we [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2003.12s)]
*  feel very very heavy it's like a heavy feeling i can't do nothing i'm always thinking about the [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2009.1999999999998s)]

*  uh that that deal to the worst deal unfortunately we're going to do that but [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2024.08s)]
*  it's very very hard people don't nobody's really happy about what's going to happen [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2029.92s)]
*  we're happy to release the hostages we're really happy to have them home but we know what the cost [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2036.48s)]
*  going to be thoughts there are people in jerusalem this morning reacting to the ceasefire which has [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2043.68s)]

*  morning for that to actually come into force after that delay that we saw but we now know [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2060.08s)]
*  which hostages will be released we know that around 90 or so palestinian prisoners will be [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2064.56s)]
*  released from israeli jails and also we know that people within gaza will be starting to move and [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2070.08s)]
*  are already starting to move back to the homes the i mean in many cases their homes won't still be [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2076.4s)]
*  standing but people do want to go back to the areas that they've been displaced from to see [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2081.76s)]
*  what is remaining and to try and rebuild their lives and aid and help is a crucial part of that [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2086.7200000000003s)]
*  more of that again is supposed to come in under this deal things like food water things to help [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2093.1200000000003s)]
*  the basic infrastructure of course medical help is really at the center of that we've we've heard [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2098.88s)]
*  many times during this conflict about the incredibly difficult situation in hospitals in [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2104.4s)]
*  gaza the impact of the fighting both on the buildings and the staff who work within them [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2110.64s)]
*  and i spoke a little earlier to dr mohammed abu mughassi he is with msf medicine frontier in gaza [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2115.7599999999998s)]

*  mean but 470 days we were calling to for this ceasefire which is was too late i mean there is [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2131.2s)]
*  massive destruction in gaza if you are in gaza you will see the massive destruction you see your [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2139.04s)]
*  population of 1.9 million 900 000 living in the south evacuated the north area you have [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2144.08s)]
*  hospitals which are partially destructed i mean everything in terms of life here is totally [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2152.4s)]
*  destroyed i mean the situation is was catastrophic and i think now uh the only thing the good thing [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2158.88s)]
*  that there will not be any kind of uh military actions people will at least have no fear but [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2165.76s)]
*  i mean the pain is coming you know i mean people will go back will try to go back to their [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2174.0s)]
*  demolished homes houses and i think the shock will be there when they see [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2178.88s)]
*  how things are especially in gaza city and the north [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2185.92s)]
*  city [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2188.8799999999997s)]
*  there is a clause in this deal although it doesn't actually come into play until further down the [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2191.8799999999997s)]
*  line whereby people who need extra and better medical treatment in gaza will be able to to leave [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2196.08s)]
*  to to come and actually get that now that is not to say that medical professionals like yourself [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2203.3599999999997s)]
*  haven't been doing your absolute best there but you know you've really been restricted haven't you [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2209.12s)]
*  with a lack of supplies a lack of hospital buildings in some case you know there are people [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2212.96s)]
*  who desperately need to get out of gaza to get additional medical treatment [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2218.0s)]
*  exactly as you mentioned i mean with all the the lack of medical disposables materials to enter [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2222.48s)]
*  to gaza the capacity of the hospitals these hospitals are field hospitals or partially [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2229.6s)]
*  functioning hospitals remaining they are not able to really treat all the patients there is a patient [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2234.64s)]
*  that needs specialized treatment and they need to be evacuated medically evacuated abroad to other [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2240.0s)]
*  hospitals in the region or in europe so i hope with this ceasefire with opening of rafa terminal [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2244.72s)]
*  again there will be thousands of patients that need to be referred abroad for specialized treatment [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2251.2s)]
*  and what about the more basic infrastructure that people are struggling with because we [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2260.64s)]
*  we talk about the patients that you have to deal with who have been who have been affected who've [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2264.7999999999997s)]
*  been wounded by airstrikes but also we know that there are people you know suffering from [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2270.32s)]
*  from more basic injuries as well from from lack of food from lack of water lack of sanitation [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2276.0800000000004s)]

*  hospitals partially destroyed or totally destroyed clinics everywhere so i mean we saw some [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2298.64s)]
*  pathological diseases that has been not before 7th october i mean the malnutrition the [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2306.24s)]

*  chemotherapy there is no treatment so i mean the there is a huge need to rebuild and to [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2328.8s)]
*  develop now the in the coming days the health structure [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2337.52s)]
*  and that gives you a really good insight into some of the medical issues that doctors have faced [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2344.72s)]
*  in gaza where they haven't often been working in hospitals or where hospitals have been attacked [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2351.04s)]

*  delays they have to do with a lot of of details and and logistical issues that go into the [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=2914.08s)]

*  ceasefire and the next phases of what's to happen in Gaza goes that there probably won't be any [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4324.719999999999s)]
*  rebuilding for quite some time? I've met with a number of people from my neighborhood and we [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4331.36s)]

*  reconstruction process started so that we hope that the ceasefire [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4352.24s)]

*  to clear the rubble and to set up camp there with other people in your neighborhood. What [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4380.8s)]
*  is the feeling there now that the ceasefire has pretty much just come into effect in the last [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4386.56s)]
*  couple of hours? What's the mood on the streets? You talked about people returning and seeing [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4391.12s)]
*  very little left or trying to recover the bodies of their loved ones. Is there [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4395.28s)]
*  a sense of hope though for the future at this point in time? In fact I've interviewed a lot of [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4399.2s)]
*  people who are returning back to their homes. However, as I told you, they are happy that they [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4407.36s)]
*  are going back home but they are suffering and feeling much pain that they find their homes [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4414.0s)]
*  destroyed and they don't return with their loved ones. A lot of families were displaced, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4422.96s)]
*  complete families and now they are going home with losing one, two, three or more members. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4434.08s)]
*  So that these are the two main reasons for their suffering and they find their homes destroyed and [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4443.68s)]
*  they are returning half of the family or they are returning losing many members and many loved ones [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4451.04s)]
*  during their displacement or before the displacement. Some families who were forced [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4458.88s)]
*  out of their homes left some of their relatives behind and they returned home and found their homes [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4465.68s)]
*  destroyed and pumped over the heads of their relatives and they started to remove the rubble [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4474.08s)]
*  in order not to replace the rubble of their homes with looking for the remains of their loved ones [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4481.12s)]
*  who were killed under the rubble of their homes by the Israeli occupation attacks. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4489.76s)]
*  Mota, there's a huge need for aid right across the Gaza Strip especially there in the north. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4495.5199999999995s)]
*  What's your understanding of how that aid could be distributed? Are you aware of that at all? We [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4500.96s)]
*  understand there are first aid trucks now arriving in Gaza under the ceasefire. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4506.64s)]
*  I think there will be no problem with distributing the aid because during the war and the genocide, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4514.4800000000005s)]
*  human and international NGOs, some of them local NGOs used to distribute aid fairly. However, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4524.320000000001s)]
*  it was very low and very, but they used to distribute this aid fairly among the [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4535.2s)]
*  community and these people, these NGOs, international NGOs, were for the program and [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4551.28s)]
*  others including Oksan and others are able to do the mission and carry out the distribution process. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4560.56s)]
*  For the reconstruction, I think that this needs much effort from governments to do it. I don't [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4571.6s)]
*  think that NGOs, even the big NGOs like the UNRWA and others, they cannot do it alone, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4581.84s)]
*  but they need the efforts of governments and officials and they need the support of [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4593.68s)]
*  countries and others. Thank you very much for being with us. Mota Sam, Ahmad, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4602.72s)]
*  showing us the scenes as you return to the remains of your home in northern Gaza. Thank you. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4609.92s)]
*  In Israel, they are anxiously awaiting the return of three female hostages who have been put on a [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4618.8s)]
*  list by Hamas as a three who will be released today. Hemrut Nimrodi is the mother of one female [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4624.88s)]
*  hostage, Tamir Nimrodi, who is an Israeli soldier. She was taken by Hamas on October 7th. She is not [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4631.6s)]
*  on the list of those to be returned today. Her mother spoke to Anna Foster a little earlier. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4637.44s)]
*  Tamir was taken when he was 18 years old. He is an IDF soldier. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4643.12s)]
*  But his unit, actually, it's Kogut, which deals with humanitarian issues of the Palestinians in [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4650.96s)]
*  Gaza. So ironically, he was taken early that morning. He managed to text me that morning, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4658.0s)]
*  asking me if I was okay. He had no idea the terrorists were already inside his base while [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4667.52s)]
*  he was texting me. And I asked him to take good care of himself and text me whenever he can. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4673.52s)]
*  And 20 minutes afterwards, he was brutally taken by Hamas terrorists. The way we found [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4681.12s)]
*  out was through my youngest daughter. She was 14 at the time. And she came to me around 4 o'clock [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4687.68s)]
*  that Saturday, screaming that she's seeing her brother being abducted over the Instagram. And [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4694.88s)]
*  she came to me with this video where I saw my son hiding his face, scared with his pajamas. He was [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4701.280000000001s)]
*  barefoot. He had no glasses on. And he was terrified. And those were... [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4711.28s)]
*  This is the last footage of him being led into Gaza while a terrorist is holding his neck and [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4720.24s)]
*  dragging him over the concrete walls into Gaza. And this is the last footage of him. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4730.639999999999s)]
*  And I think it's important for people watching to know that you don't receive updates. You don't [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4737.04s)]
*  have anything, anything at all to let you know how he is, where he is, what his condition might be. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4744.48s)]
*  It's just silence, isn't it? Nothing at all. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4751.2s)]
*  Just silence. I spoke with the president of the Red Cross. And she said, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4753.04s)]
*  there's no way for us to get in and check on the hostages because Hamas won't let us. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4758.799999999999s)]
*  And so here I am with no clue what happened to my son, if he's being bullied or [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4764.88s)]
*  he gets food or sunlight or if he's even still alive. I have no idea. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4776.48s)]
*  And I said right at the start that these conversations, every time you tell this story, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4783.12s)]
*  it hurts. But it's important for you to keep telling the story, to keep Tamir's picture as [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4788.24s)]
*  you can see there, his name, to keep that out there so people don't forget about him and the [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4793.84s)]
*  others who are being held. That is true. I owe it to Tamir. And I owe it to my daughters that [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4798.24s)]
*  looks at me every day and needs to see me fighting for Tamir and for them, for their future. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4804.56s)]
*  I don't know what is going to be next as the hostages will return and there will be fewer. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4813.6s)]
*  In captivity, we are very scared that we will lose the support of the public. And it's really [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4822.48s)]
*  necessary that everybody will stick with us till the end, till the last one is home. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4829.759999999999s)]
*  And we've been talking about those 33 hostages that are due to be released in this first phase, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4836.48s)]
*  but it's particular groups of people. And sadly, Tamir being a soldier, being on duty at that time, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4840.959999999999s)]
*  you know that these next six weeks will not include him. You know that already. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4847.759999999999s)]
*  So there's that extra pressure for you for things to go well, for things to keep moving forward. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4852.0s)]
*  Of course, this is not the deal we hoped for. We really wanted to see, even though it could be [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4857.44s)]
*  a few phases, but still to have a done deal with everything agreed in the beginning would be much [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4865.12s)]
*  easier for us to go through. But when we know that only on the 16th day they will start discussing [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4871.44s)]
*  the details of the second phase, it's really scary for us. Not knowing if we will see our [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4878.48s)]
*  children back home, who will survive, who would last that long. We have no idea. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4884.16s)]
*  Harold Nimroddi, the mother of Israeli soldier Tamir Nimroddi, who was kidnapped by Hamas. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4889.839999999999s)]
*  Well, earlier my colleague, Lis Dussett, spoke to Sigrid Karg, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4895.28s)]
*  UN's special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4898.639999999999s)]
*  I think it's a very fluid and fragile situation. We also know that people have been [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4902.48s)]
*  more than desperate for so many months. Chaos has to be factored in, but we have tried with Qatar, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4907.44s)]
*  with the US, with Egypt, and in very effective cooperation with the Israelis to try to find ways [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4914.0s)]
*  in which to channel that. There are agreements with the civilian police, so we are hopeful [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4920.0s)]
*  that the risk of chaos can be as mitigated as possible. But one should expect joy, despair, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4926.08s)]
*  people out in the streets. It will not be easy, but we have prepared to the extent this is humanly [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4934.56s)]
*  possible. You mentioned the civilian police. They are the police of Hamas. They'll be wearing [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4940.24s)]
*  the blue uniforms. Hamas, of course, has been significantly weakened during these 15 months [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4948.56s)]
*  of war. Do they really have the ability and the will to take on what you know, because you've [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4954.16s)]
*  been dealing with it in your work, the criminal gangs who have been attacking the aid convoys as [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4960.64s)]
*  they enter Gaza, a sign of the desperation there? Well, the proof of the pudding here [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4966.0s)]
*  lies in the eating. I think there's another factor not to be underestimated, the civilians themselves. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4973.4400000000005s)]
*  They know aid is coming for them. They have endured criminal activity. They have also been a victim [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4979.6s)]
*  of the looting that's taken place. It has deprived them of this critical essential [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4986.64s)]
*  assistance that was being sent, even though it was too low in volume and too little over time. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4991.68s)]
*  I think the balancing act lies in the constant flow in the implementation. And as I said, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=4997.76s)]
*  I can't exclude a form of chaos erupting. I also can't predict right now that all will be well with [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5003.68s)]
*  the civilian police, but we are hopeful that the security arrangements that are put in place [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5010.0s)]
*  and with the assistance on the Egyptian side, that we can help manage this and mitigate this. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5015.68s)]
*  I think the importance is also the effective implementation of this deal. Also, when it comes [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5021.52s)]
*  to the volume that has now been agreed to both to the south and the north of Gaza, food, all kinds [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5027.04s)]
*  of other items and fuel so the facilities could be running. It's a complex operation. One of the most [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5034.08s)]
*  complex I would venture in this day and age under these conditions. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5039.6s)]
*  So 600 trucks. As you know, we've heard time and again this word flow, that aid hundreds of trucks [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5047.200000000001s)]
*  will flow into Gaza and they never did. The numbers, as you know, have been far, far short [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5054.64s)]
*  of what is needed. Are you convinced that the logistics are in place in terms of the UN being [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5060.8s)]
*  able to deliver the aid, the Israelis allowing and not holding them up by strenuous inspections? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5067.28s)]
*  Are you sure that there will be the flow this time? Well, we've made, we've gone through, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5073.28s)]
*  we've dotted the T, we've crossed the T's and dotted the I's in recent days. My colleagues, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5079.2s)]
*  technical teams have been in Cairo precisely for that purpose, speaking with the Israelis, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5084.48s)]
*  the Qataris, Egyptians and the US. There's a fairly detailed agreement in place. We know that [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5090.16s)]
*  assistance will come from Israel, West Bank, the very effective Jordan route that has been working. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5097.12s)]
*  Trucks are entering as we speak from Egypt via Kerem Shalom and aid will continue to flow from [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5103.44s)]
*  Ashdod. Am I sure with the certainty 100% things can happen? But these are the arrangements and as [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5111.599999999999s)]
*  my Qatari colleague described, there are operational crisis cells and rooms in place [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5121.12s)]
*  to troubleshoot if and when something risks derailing. The flow is important, the continuity [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5126.48s)]
*  and of course ultimately, as we've often said, the distribution to people inside Gaza. Nothing matters [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5132.72s)]
*  if it doesn't reach me. As you know, the Israelis, when they've been challenged about the small [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5140.4s)]
*  number of aid trucks, they've always said that hundreds of trucks are there ready to move, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5148.56s)]
*  but the United Nations didn't have the capability to deliver the food. As part of this process, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5152.56s)]
*  have you been able to send in more people into Gaza to help, been able to strengthen your own [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5157.76s)]
*  logistics, your own chain, supply chain to ensure that the performance will be better? [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5164.72s)]
*  Well, this is one of the areas we continue to work on to scale up, but don't forget, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5172.72s)]
*  that most of our staff in Gaza are Palestinian civilians who are there working. A lot of Palestinian [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5178.240000000001s)]
*  NGOs and ultimately my own colleagues. This aid delivery doesn't depend solely on the UN. We are [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5184.080000000001s)]
*  a big motor, including of course UNRWA, the backbone of most of these operations, but there [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5191.200000000001s)]
*  are also bilateral support mechanisms in place now, as well as an important role that the NGOs [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5196.88s)]
*  will play. It's a combined effort. What it does show, however, with this agreement in place [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5202.72s)]
*  and with the early hours of it being implemented, it shows the power and difference political will [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5209.04s)]
*  makes. Systems can be there. If there's not the political will to execute decisions taking, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5216.400000000001s)]
*  everything else fails. There is the political will. We need to make sure that the pressure is [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5223.280000000001s)]
*  sustained and international commitments also to finance and to help accelerate the assistance [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5228.24s)]
*  are there and remain in place. Gaza is not saved overnight. The UN's Stig Reid card that [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7F-YOePkT8&t=5234.24s)]
