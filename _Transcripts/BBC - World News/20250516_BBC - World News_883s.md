Video Description: Recent events in the Middle East have shown Iran is prepared to attack its enemies far beyond its borders. 
Through direct strikes on Israel or via the regime’s network of proxies - what Tehran calls it’s ‘axis of resistance’. 
But further afield, the regime is also waging a clandestine conflict - targeting individuals it sees as enemies of the state. 
Over the past three years, Western intelligence services say there has been a surge in these lethal operations.  
The BBC World Service’s Jiyar Gol has been investigating the growing number of Iranian backed assassination plots and tracing the criminal networks working on behalf of the regime.

# BBC Eye investigates attacks against critics of the Iranian regime on foreign soil | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA)
*  For decades, Iran has been carrying out targeted attacks against critics of the regime living [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=0.0s)]
*  abroad. Iranian journalists and dissidents around the world have increasingly found themselves [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=10.84s)]
*  caught in the crosshairs. I've been following plots carried out by criminal proxies around [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=19.64s)]
*  the world. One name keeps coming up again and again, an organized crime boss, Najib Sharifi Zindashti. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=37.72s)]
*  This is the story of a chilling connection between Iranian security forces and international criminal [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=47.36s)]
*  networks. In 2017, Saeed Kareem was assassinated on the streets of Istanbul. He run a series of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=65.84s)]
*  TV channels, Gem TV, that aired western movies and series to Iran. In the eyes of the Islamic regime, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=90.64s)]
*  the programs were against Islamic values. Well, our correspondent, Gia Gold joins us now from [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=99.16s)]
*  Istanbul. Some other people on social media, they say there was a lot of murky businesses. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=106.92s)]
*  It might be actually some sort of business feud or gangs related issue, but what we know [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=112.52s)]
*  definitely Iranian regime wasn't happy with the kind of program he was showing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=117.42s)]
*  Just two years later, Masoud Moulavi Vardinjani, a former member of the Iranian Revolutionary [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=122.18s)]
*  Guards Corps, who had defected, was assassinated in Istanbul. He had been publishing details of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=134.06s)]
*  corruption at the highest level in Iranian leadership on his Telegram account called [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=141.46s)]
*  Black Box. An Iranian diplomat on his way to Tehran was arrested in Istanbul Airport, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=146.94s)]
*  but was later released after he claimed diplomatic immunity. I got hold of this copy of the Turkish [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=154.78s)]
*  court document and the investigation around the assassination of Saeed Kareem Yan in Istanbul. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=168.98s)]
*  There is a suspect name here, Najib Sharifi Zindashti. I've heard that name before, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=174.82s)]
*  but in connection with drug trafficking, not political assassination. Timur Suikhan is one [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  of Turkey's leading investigative journalists and has exposed crime and corruption at the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  same time. He was the driver of Zindashti, who had done his research on crime, and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  also showed the target to the investigators at the time of the murder. Even after Kareem Yan died, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  this driver went to Zindashti, and a phone call with Zindashti was received. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  A year later, Zindashti was arrested in connection with the killing. He was held for six months, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=248.14s)]
*  but was then released. In October 2020, another dissident was targeted. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=263.82s)]
*  Habib Chaab was lured from Sweden to Turkey and abducted. The Iranian regime accused Chaab of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=279.02s)]
*  plotting attacks against Iranian security forces. He was smuggled back to Iran, where a confession [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  was extracted. After a show trial, he was convicted and executed. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=297.1s)]
*  Zindashti's nephew was arrested in Turkey in connection with the kidnapping and served time in prison. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  So, who is Naci Zindashti? Zindashti was known to be a notorious drug trafficker in Turkey. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=317.82s)]
*  But is there more to him? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=328.14s)]
*  Turkey is one of the meeting points of drug routes from the East and criminal gangs supplying drugs [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=348.62s)]
*  to Europe in the West. Zindashti grew up in the border area of Iran that has seen drugs traffic [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=355.26s)]
*  for decades. Someone who knows his history and whose identity we are concealing for his own safety [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=362.7s)]
*  says drug running is what brought him to the attention of the authorities while he was still [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  a young man in Iran in 1996. He is portrayed here by an actor. Naci was arrested for drug smuggling [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=380.06s)]
*  and sentenced to death, but rumors later surfaced that he killed a prison guard and had escaped from [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=389.73999999999995s)]
*  Tehran prison. Now we finally understand the true reason behind his release. If someone is sentenced [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=396.06s)]
*  to death and kills a prison guard and escapes, there is no doubt that he will be executed by [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=403.5s)]
*  Iranian Islamic laws. So, the only plausible way for him to return and live freely would be [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=409.98s)]
*  if he'd been working for Iran's intelligence services. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=419.74s)]
*  Zindashti, who the U.S. authorities say is an asset of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=433.5s)]
*  is the prime suspect in each of the plots against the Iranian dissidents in Turkey. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=459.42s)]
*  In 2017 for the murder of Saeed Karimian. In 2019 for the murder of Masoud Moulavi Vardinjani. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=467.42s)]
*  In 2020 the abduction of Habib Chabd. Turkey has charged Iranian diplomats and people linked [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=476.94s)]
*  to Zindashti for their roles in the plots. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=485.02s)]
*  This is not the first time, but there was always a connection between the organizations and the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=515.02s)]
*  intelligence agencies. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=520.86s)]
*  Zindashti was only Karimian, Vardinjani and Habib Chabd's drug smuggling. There were other [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=525.98s)]
*  murders in the case. Despite these heavy charges and despite the large file, the release [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=534.6999999999999s)]
*  of Zindashti was a huge scandal. It shocked us all. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=540.62s)]
*  A year later, Nodiz Zindashti was implicated in yet another plot, this time more than 5,000 miles away, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  just outside the U.S. capital in Maryland. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=560.22s)]
*  The feds charged one Iranian and two Canadian nationals for plotting the murders of two [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=565.26s)]
*  Maryland residents, one of whom had defected from Iran, according to court documents. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=569.98s)]
*  We have seen that the IRGC and Quds Force are a part of Iran's efforts to undertake both lethal [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  plots, plots to kidnap and also to harass dissidents and other perceived opponents. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=582.22s)]
*  I think there is a growing body of evidence and some of this evidence is now public following the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=588.46s)]
*  January indictment and the sanctions that we imposed on Zindashti and his code conspirators [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=594.3s)]
*  about this plot. And I think what we've seen is, you know, this is one example of the Iranian [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=600.8599999999999s)]
*  regime's efforts to use transnational plotting to coordinate with organized criminal groups in [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=607.02s)]
*  order to target its perceived opponents. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=614.38s)]
*  In December 2023, this document was filed in the District of Minnesota against [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=617.26s)]
*  Hell's Angels members. What is interesting here, the prosecutor refers to the target as [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=628.9399999999999s)]
*  victim number one who had defected from Iran. It is very clear whoever this person was [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=637.66s)]
*  must have been a member of Iranian establishment. That's why they were so angry they came after [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=646.46s)]
*  this person. This document also transcribes an online chat on how to kill victim number one [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=653.26s)]
*  and Zindashti has been communicating with this criminal group. He says it must be overkill. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  Eventually they agree on US$370,000. And Zindashti said, you have to make a show, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=670.06s)]
*  make an example of him. We got to erase his head from his torso. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=679.26s)]
*  We have seen evidence of this kind of coordination between Iranian government officials [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=686.3s)]
*  and criminal organizations, whether it's drug traffickers, organizations such as the Hell's [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=693.26s)]
*  Angels. And I think some of this evidence is now public as we've seen through the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=698.62s)]
*  publication of the indictment against Zindashti and his network. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=703.1s)]
*  The UK Domestic Security Services, MI5, has reported 20 credible plots against Iranian [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=713.34s)]
*  nationals in the UK. We're determined to protect those individuals. We're determined to protect [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=720.38s)]
*  free and fair broadcasting and journalism from the UK. And we are going after, hard, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=726.38s)]
*  those individuals who either think they can project that from places like Iran, or they think that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=734.78s)]
*  they can simply enter into a contract with organized or low level criminals to do that [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=741.26s)]
*  dirty work for them. In January 2024, the UK government sanctioned Zindashti to members of [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=746.54s)]
*  his gang convicted in relation to plots in Turkey, two Iranian diplomats, and Unit 840 of the elite [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=754.54s)]
*  Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=763.0999999999999s)]
*  The IRGC and Iranian intelligence turned a blind eye or permitted him to traffic drugs domestically [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=768.6999999999999s)]
*  and internationally. In exchange, he aids them to the targeted abductions and killings of Iranian [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=777.34s)]
*  dissidents abroad. We put all the issues raised in this film to Iranian officials, but didn't [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=784.86s)]
*  receive a response. I managed to track down a rare interview that Zindashti had done with a [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=792.38s)]
*  journalist from Iran who asked him about his involvement in the plots and attacks. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=799.26s)]
*  Over the last two years, intelligence services both in the US and abroad say lethal operations [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=859.42s)]
*  against critics of the regime have accelerated. Meanwhile, the alleged kingpin behind many of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=868.78s)]
*  these plots, Naji Zindashti, remains a wanted man. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzgGsjuAdA&t=876.14s)]
