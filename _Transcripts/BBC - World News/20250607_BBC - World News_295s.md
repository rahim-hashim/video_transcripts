# How Ukraine's operation 'Spider Web' in Russia unfolded | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o)
*  Ukraine called it Operation Spiderweb. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=0.0s)]
*  It claimed over 100 drone attacks on military targets across Russia. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=3.0s)]
*  The media called it audacious. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=7.0s)]
*  And this was an extraordinary, unprecedented attack on Russia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=10.0s)]
*  Let's look at what Ukraine did on June 1st and how it was done. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=14.0s)]
*  Russia says air bases in five regions were targeted, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=18.0s)]
*  but the planes were only damaged in two. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=21.0s)]
*  Ukraine says four bases and 41 military aircraft were hit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=24.0s)]
*  In addition, BBC Verify has found evidence of attacks at these four bases, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=28.0s)]
*  one of them thousands of kilometres from Ukraine. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=32.0s)]
*  As for what precisely was targeted, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=35.0s)]
*  President Zelensky says the drones were aimed exclusively at military targets, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=37.0s)]
*  specifically the equipment used in strikes against Ukraine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=41.0s)]
*  To build a picture of what happened, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=45.0s)]
*  BBC Verify has been analysing drone footage, other videos and satellite imagery. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=47.0s)]
*  Let's start with Belaya Air Base in the east of Russia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=52.0s)]
*  This footage is from a Ukrainian drone used in the operation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=55.0s)]
*  It shows a Tu-95 long-range bomber. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=59.0s)]
*  It can launch cruise missiles and has been used by Russia to attack Ukraine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=62.0s)]
*  Next, this is a satellite image of the same base from May. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=66.0s)]
*  It shows several of this type of plane. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=71.0s)]
*  Compare that with this satellite image of the same base after the attack. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=73.0s)]
*  Three of the planes we can see are badly damaged, possibly destroyed, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=78.0s)]
*  and a wider view of the satellite image shows other planes were damaged too. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=82.0s)]
*  There's also this video taken near the base that clearly shows smoke from the attack. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=87.0s)]
*  And if that's Belaya Air Base, we also have video from Ivanovo Air Base, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=92.0s)]
*  which is northeast of Moscow. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=97.0s)]
*  This drone footage was released by Ukraine on Wednesday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=99.0s)]
*  In it, we see two Russian aircraft being approached. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=102.0s)]
*  These are Beriev A-50s. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=105.0s)]
*  They're early warning aircraft and can see threats hundreds of kilometers away. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=107.0s)]
*  They've been used in the war too. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=112.0s)]
*  As the drone seems to make contact with the aircraft, the footage cuts out. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=115.0s)]
*  It's very likely the planes were hit, though satellite analysis is inconclusive. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=119.0s)]
*  And as we've learned more about Operation Spiderweb, one question keeps being asked. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=124.0s)]
*  How did Ukraine do this? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=129.0s)]
*  It says the operation was directed by the chief of Ukraine's security service [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=132.0s)]
*  and took 18 months to plan. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=136.0s)]
*  And while using drones in war isn't new, what Ukraine had planned certainly was. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=138.0s)]
*  Ukraine says first the drones were smuggled into Russia. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=144.0s)]
*  Then wooden cabins were also transported into Russia. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=147.0s)]
*  This image released by Ukraine shows how the drones were then hidden under the roofs of the cabins. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=151.0s)]
*  We don't know when this was done. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=157.0s)]
*  The cabins were then placed onto trucks and were transported to locations near the targets. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=159.0s)]
*  This was done reportedly without the drivers knowing what was in their cargo. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=164.0s)]
*  Then, when the time came, the roofs of the cabins were opened remotely and the drones were able to fly out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=168.0s)]
*  This video, taken close to Belaya Air Base, shows this happening. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=175.0s)]
*  As the drone emerges in the distance, there's already smoke rising from the air base. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=179.0s)]
*  The drones that were used are known as quadcopters. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=185.0s)]
*  They have four propellers, they can carry explosives, and they also have cameras. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=188.0s)]
*  This allows the pilot to operate the drone remotely with the help of a video feed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=193.0s)]
*  And Ukraine gave us more detail on this in a post. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=198.0s)]
*  It says the drones were sometimes flown by pilots, but sometimes when the signal was lost, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=201.0s)]
*  they were flown by AI along pre-planned routes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=205.0s)]
*  Then, when contact was made with the target, explosives were automatically triggered. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=209.0s)]
*  For its part, Russia says not all of these attacks were successful. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=215.0s)]
*  It claims at military airfields in Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur regions, all terrorist attacks were repelled. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=218.0s)]
*  We can't confirm this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=225.0s)]
*  What's not disputed is that these attacks happened and that some damage was done. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=227.0s)]
*  So, what impact will the operation have on the war? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=231.0s)]
*  First, the attacks have hurt Russia's military capability. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=235.0s)]
*  This is undoubtedly an operation that will go down in military history. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=239.0s)]
*  And when one puts that in context, you know, the losses in context to Russia's overall capability, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=243.0s)]
*  that's a significant chunk of Russia's strategic bombing force. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=249.0s)]
*  This was an attack on Russia's military capacity and also on its security. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=253.0s)]
*  These are embarrassing attacks because these air bases in Russia really should have been secured better. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=258.0s)]
*  This is a country that is at war. This is a country with nuclear bombers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=263.0s)]
*  This is a country that should be expecting attacks even inside the territory. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=268.0s)]
*  But Russia appears to have not seen this coming. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=273.0s)]
*  And as the war continues in Ukraine, most experts agree these attacks won't fundamentally change the conflict. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=276.0s)]
*  But they have exposed Russian vulnerabilities and have shown a new type of attack. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=282.0s)]
*  President Zelensky said this operation was designed to tell Russia it is not safe. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=287.0s)]
*  By that measure, it succeeded. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YuMxd44Y5o&t=292.0s)]
