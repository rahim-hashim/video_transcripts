Video Description: Two months after Israel closed all crossings to the Gaza Strip, there are warnings that mass starvation could be imminent.
The UN's World Food Programme and Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, recently said they have used up all their stocks of food aid.
A few dozen remaining food kitchens are now the only source of a daily meal for hundreds of thousands of people.
Israel shut all crossings to Gaza on 2 March - preventing all goods, including food, fuel and medicines from entering - and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. 
It said these steps were meant to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages it still holds.

# Gaza mass starvation warning | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k)
*  Two months after Israel closed all crossings to the Gaza Strip, there are warnings that mass starvation could be imminent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=0.0s)]
*  The UN's World Food Programme and UNRWA, the Agency for Palestinian Refugees, say they've used up all their food stocks and there's little left to buy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=7.0s)]
*  A few dozen remaining food kitchens are the only source of a daily meal for hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=17.0s)]
*  Let's speak to our Middle East correspondent Yolande now. These warnings are dire, Yolande. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=23.0s)]
*  That's right. And what we've seen in the past day or so are more powerful statements coming from top UN officials about this blockade that has gone on now for two months in Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=30.0s)]
*  You had the emergency director of the World Health Organisation saying that what was unfolding was an abomination. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=43.0s)]
*  He said if we don't do something about it, we're complicit in what is happening. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=50.0s)]
*  And then he had the UN's humanitarian chief saying this was a cruel and collective punishment of Palestinians. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=54.0s)]
*  And he said that quite simply blocking aid kills. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=61.0s)]
*  Now, Israel has previously denied that there is a hunger crisis in Gaza, and it's just not clear at the moment when aid will be allowed back in. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=65.0s)]
*  A hot meal is hard to come by in Gaza, but for needy families in the south, a delivery is on its way. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=77.0s)]
*  Today's dish is koshary made with lentils, rice and a tomato sauce, cooked in a community kitchen by American Near East Refugee Aid. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=85.0s)]
*  This will feed about 6,000 people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=95.0s)]
*  Sami Muttar says his team is doing the best it can in desperate circumstances. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=107.0s)]
*  In the past, we used to cook rice with meat, with protein. Now there is no any type of meat or vegetables also. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=112.0s)]
*  Entered Gaza, the people rely on our meats. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=121.0s)]
*  Israel blocked all goods to Gaza two months ago, and then resumed its military offensive, saying this was to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=126.0s)]
*  Food stockpiled during the ceasefire at the start of this year has all but run out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=136.0s)]
*  We used to receive more than 100 trucks every week. And now we don't have anything in our warehouse. There is no food parcels, no flower bags. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=142.0s)]
*  Within two weeks, Gaza's community kitchens, a last lifeline for so many, will have to shut down. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=157.0s)]
*  If the situation will continue with the closure of the crossings, Gaza will face again the risk of starvation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=164.0s)]
*  El Mouassi is a sprawling tent camp for displaced people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=174.0s)]
*  Conditions here are tough and getting tougher. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=182.0s)]
*  This man's been searching unsuccessfully for bread. Now he can feed his family of seven. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=185.0s)]
*  Others are also thankful for the handouts. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=192.0s)]
*  At this time it's excellent because there's no cooking gas, no food. I collect leaves to start a fire just so we can have a cup of tea. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=196.0s)]
*  Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid, but humanitarian workers say they closely monitor their supplies. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=205.0s)]
*  With rising cases of acute malnutrition among children, there are warnings that starving civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=212.0s)]
*  For now in Gaza, as the cooking pots are washed up, there's no choice but to live day by day, hoping that tomorrow will finally bring relief. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=224.0s)]
*  Today, aid officials and Palestinian residents in Gaza have been talking about how there were some significant looting incidents involving aid earlier this week. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=235.0s)]
*  Five in total on Wednesday. They were at the UN's main complex for UNRWA in Gaza, also at some businessman stores and in community kitchens as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=248.0s)]
*  UNRWA has said there were thousands of displaced people involved in the raid on its premises and that medicines were stolen from its pharmacy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=261.0s)]
*  There were some cars damaged as well. The UNRWA spokeswoman has said that this, while devastating, is not surprising in the face of total systemic collapse. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=271.0s)]
*  Those are her words. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=282.0s)]
*  What signs are there, if any, that international pressure is having any effect on Israel to lift the blockade? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=283.0s)]
*  It's notable that some of Israel's closest allies have spoken out about this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=290.0s)]
*  We had a statement that was from its closest European allies, the UK, Germany and France, really demanding that the blockade stop and stop the blockade. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=296.0s)]
*  We had also President Trump one week ago, so supportive of Israel, telling journalists that he had told Israel's Prime Minister that Israel has got to be good to Gaza. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=309.0s)]
*  It's got to allow food and medicines in. But we have not seen any change in Israeli policy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=319.0s)]
*  In fact, from those particularly on the Israeli side, we have seen a lot of change. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=325.0s)]
*  We have not seen any change in Israeli policy. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=333.0s)]
*  In fact, from those particularly on the far right in Israel's government, there is strong support for the continuation of this policy to put pressure on Hamas, they say, to bring back the hostages. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=336.0s)]
*  How widely felt is that support amongst the Israeli public? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=350.0s)]
*  You start to see a very mixed response around the Israeli public, where certainly in recent polls we saw a lot of support for a ceasefire that would prioritise bringing back the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=357.0s)]
*  It's thought that up to 24 of those are still alive. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=373.0s)]
*  The reason Israel has said that it is holding off from ending the war in accordance with what Hamas has been demanding is that it says its military goal is to dismantle Hamas in terms of its military and governing capabilities to remove it as a threat to Israel. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=378.0s)]
*  Yiland, for the moment, thank you very much. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1AAhdccQ3k&t=395.0s)]
