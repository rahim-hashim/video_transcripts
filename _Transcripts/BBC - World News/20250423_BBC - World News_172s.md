*  Mark just talk us through what's been happening there [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=65.3s)]

*  Crowding onto the square watching that service that was on big screens behind me as the coffin of Pope Francis was taken from the residence where he lived during his 12 years as Pope [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=75.1s)]
*  The Santa Marta residence inside the Vatican [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=86.1s)]
*  And it was taken to St. Peter's Basilica where it now lies before the altar of the confession [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  An altar beneath which it is believed that the tomb of St. Peter lies [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  Of course remember popes are thought to be by the faithful successors to St. Peter [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  It is an altar that is covered by a bronze baldekin which was designed and created by the Baroque 16th century artist Bernini [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  And then that lies below the fantastic gilded dome of St. Peter's Basilica which is from Michelangelo [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=116.7s)]
*  And then that basilica will be open until midnight today and tomorrow for the faithful to file in to try to catch a glimpse of Pope Francis who lies in that open coffin [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=123.7s)]
*  He's been temporarily embalmed, he's wearing a mitre, his red vestments, he's holding rosary beads [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  And then on Friday the basilica will close at 7pm ready for that funeral to start on Saturday morning [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=140.5s)]
*  A funeral that will attract world leaders, royalty and heads of state from around the world [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=146.5s)]
*  And then following the funeral the coffin will be taken across Rome to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=152.5s)]
*  Which is where Pope Francis wants to be buried [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=158.5s)]
*  It's more than a century since a pope was not buried at the Vatican [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=161.5s)]
*  It's much more symbolic of how Francis wanted a humbler, simpler end to his life [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP_p1finWdc&t=165.5s)]
