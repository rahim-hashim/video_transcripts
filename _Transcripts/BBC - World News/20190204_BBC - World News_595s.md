Video Description: Female genital mutilation (FGM) is increasingly being performed on babies and infants in the UK, we have been told.
FGM expert and barrister Dr Charlotte Proudman said it was "almost impossible to detect" as the girls were not in school or old enough to report it.
In one case, in Yorkshire, a victim was just one month old.
Anna Collinson reports, in the days following a landmark first conviction for FGM in the UK.

# FGM 'being performed on UK babies' - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 04, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc)
*  It was the most cruelest thing for a child to experience, in my opinion it is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=0.0s)]
*  Female genital mutilation. It's child abuse and a crime. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=13.24s)]
*  Stop cutting your girls. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=18.48s)]
*  After a 34-year wait, the UK has had its first FGM conviction. Now our investigation has [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=21.96s)]
*  found victims are getting younger so parents can avoid detection. The youngest we've been [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=27.76s)]
*  told of was just one month old. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=32.56s)]
*  I have certainly come across instances where FGM has been performed on babies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=35.52s)]
*  People contact the Victoria Derbyshire programme a lot, but over the summer we received one [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=47.44s)]
*  which really caught our attention. At that point we had no idea where it would lead us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=51.919999999999995s)]
*  I need you to help me with social services, hospital and police for the lies they have put on my family. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=58.0s)]
*  They took my child saying I did FGM on my child. My child fell on a cupboard. I need your help. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=64.8s)]
*  For legal reasons we can't identify anyone involved, but the mother told us she and the father had been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=74.08s)]
*  accused of performing FGM on their three-year-old daughter. We spoke to her lawyer and arranged for [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=79.04s)]
*  us all to meet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  But when I met the parents, the mother's attitude had completely changed. She did not want to talk about what had happened. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=87.2s)]
*  At one point she leaned in close to me and asked me not to speak to anyone but her because they couldn't be trusted. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  When I said I couldn't do that, she seemed frustrated. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=98.56s)]
*  Soon after our meeting, the pair were arrested and charged. Their trial took place at the Old Bailey where a jury [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=102.72s)]
*  heard the girl, who we're going to call Jade, was deliberately cut with a sharp instrument. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=108.08s)]
*  Jade lost a considerable amount of blood and later told police a witch had cut her. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  The father was acquitted but the mother was found guilty of female genital mutilation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=118.24s)]
*  Figures estimate 137,000 women and girls in England have been victims of FGM. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=125.44s)]
*  So why has a conviction taken so long? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=131.36s)]
*  That morning was about being held down, your legs yanked apart and your genitals literally ripped apart. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=134.48s)]
*  You saw the cutter every time she brought her hands up. The blood was everywhere. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=145.2s)]
*  Hibba Wadir was six years old when a special party was thrown for her. She was told it would make her a woman. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=151.76s)]
*  She just kept on cutting, just kept on cutting as if... [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=158.08s)]
*  It was normal for her to hear screams. You drown, you drown in that pain and it was... [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=164.48s)]
*  It was the most cruelest thing for a child to experience. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=177.12s)]
*  In my opinion it is. It's not only that day it stays with you for life. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=186.16s)]
*  It's a life sentence. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=192.55999999999997s)]
*  There are many women like Hibba who underwent FGM and then came to the UK [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  but it's also being practiced on girls who are from Britain like the case involving three-year-old Jade. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  Her mother believed it was the right thing to do to keep her daughter clean, to keep her daughter pure. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=208.32s)]
*  Her mum didn't believe for one minute she was committing child abuse but she was. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=215.27999999999997s)]
*  Pupils as young as 11 are being told a true story similar to that of Jade and Hibba. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  We've been told as many as 60,000 girls in the UK are at risk of FGM every year. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=228.72s)]
*  The deliberate cutting of the female genitals is an act of control to prevent sexual enjoyment. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=234.32s)]
*  It can also lead to long-term health problems and even death. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=239.84s)]
*  These pupils aren't at risk but their teachers believe it's important they're aware of it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=243.76s)]
*  This story has been, it's touched me because being a boy and having a female sibling, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=248.24s)]
*  or I'm pretty sure some of you boys have female siblings, imagine this going through. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=254.16s)]
*  It's the most horrible thing I can imagine. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=258.8s)]
*  For so long FGM has been hidden but the Freedom Charity says it's seen a rise in schools requesting [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=262.72s)]
*  its workshops. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  Stand up if you want to see FGM stop. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=270.64s)]
*  We're about to show a short graphic that shows different types of FGM. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=273.68s)]
*  We're using artwork not actual images. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=277.2s)]
*  There are four main types of female genital mutilation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=282.0s)]
*  The first involves removing all or part of the clitoris. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  Type two is even more invasive. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=290.8s)]
*  Along with the clitoris, the labia, also known as the lips, is removed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=292.88s)]
*  Type three is the most severe form of FGM. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=298.32s)]
*  The vaginal opening is narrowed by cutting and removing the labia. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=301.04s)]
*  The edges are then stitched together leaving a tiny opening for urine and menstrual fluid. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=304.48s)]
*  Other painful procedures include pricking, scraping or burning the genitals. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  People are reporting FGM to emergency services. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  We found more than 900 calls were made in a five year period. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=322.16s)]
*  The Crown Prosecution Service has only had 36 referrals from the police since 2010. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=326.0s)]
*  Now we have one historic conviction. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=330.8s)]
*  It's really astounding that we haven't had an FGM conviction since 1985, since the Act was initially introduced. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=334.8s)]
*  People are concerned about cultural sensitivities. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=342.8s)]
*  They're worried about being branded racist and so they're reluctant to intervene. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=345.52s)]
*  On top of that you have a practice that's being performed on a very private area of the country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=349.2s)]
*  Experts say authorities need a more joined up approach when dealing with FGM. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=354.16s)]
*  It's claimed children's services can be unsure when to intervene. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=358.16s)]
*  Doctors aren't always reporting it to the police and even if they do, officers don't always know what to do. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=362.16s)]
*  We've also been told victims are getting younger, which makes it harder to detect. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=368.16s)]
*  There's a lot of anecdotal data to show that FGM is now being performed on babies. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=372.16s)]
*  These girls who are only a few weeks old or months old, they are not at school, they're not at nursery. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=378.16s)]
*  And so it's very difficult for any public authorities to become aware of the practice. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=384.16s)]
*  And so by performing it at such a young age, they're evading the law and making sure that the families are not going to be subject to a prosecution. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=388.16s)]
*  One police force says one in four of its reports of FGM were aged three or under. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=398.16s)]
*  Out of those 17 reports, the youngest was just one month old. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=402.16s)]
*  France has taken a much tougher stance on FGM compared to the UK. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=412.16s)]
*  So we've come to Paris to meet the woman responsible for more than 100 convictions. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=416.16s)]
*  FGM has dominated Linda Vey-Keriel's legal career. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=420.16s)]
*  And as soon as you enter her flat, it shows you're a woman who's been in prison for more than a decade. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=424.16s)]
*  And as soon as you enter her flat, it shows. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=430.16s)]
*  Everywhere you look are folders, books and piles of paper about the procedure. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=437.16s)]
*  Much of the content is too distressing to broadcast. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=441.16s)]
*  This is how very many children are completely destroyed. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=446.16s)]
*  That photo is truly shocking, isn't it? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=454.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=456.16s)]
*  Linda believes high-profile convictions are the best way to prevent FGM. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=457.16s)]
*  She's also very clear about who is to blame. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=461.16s)]
*  Parents are responsible. They want it. They pay for it. They bring the child to the CTAH. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=464.16s)]
*  They are the most responsible. The CTAH, you know, she does what she's paid for. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=470.16s)]
*  All children in France undergo regular genital checks until the age of six. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=478.16s)]
*  Doctors are expected to report any cases of physical abuse. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=483.16s)]
*  In your system, you need the victim to come and complain. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=488.16s)]
*  But how can you expect a child to complain against her parents? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=493.16s)]
*  I mean, it's for the society to protect children and to come and to take the initiative. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=498.16s)]
*  As soon as the mutilation is documented, and the only way to document it is to have a medical examination. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=505.16s)]
*  There may be people watching who would be horrified at the idea of their little girl undergoing a check. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  What would you say to them? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't understand that, because what is at stake is the life and good health of babies, of children. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=528.16s)]
*  We've spoken to lawyers in the UK who support medical checks being introduced here, but for others it's a horrifying idea. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=539.16s)]
*  Nobody wants to end FGM more than me. Nobody does. But there is many other predictive ways to end FGM. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=547.16s)]
*  Vital ways, as I said, education. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=555.16s)]
*  After decades of secrecy, the first FGM conviction is a historic moment for the UK. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=559.16s)]
*  It's hoped it'll encourage more victims to come forward, safe in the knowledge they'll not only be believed, but taken seriously. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=565.16s)]
*  We need more cases of FGM that come before the courts and more cases that result in a conviction, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=572.16s)]
*  because that will send out a public message that FGM is not tolerated in this country [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=577.16s)]
*  and that people will feel the full force of the law. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOmh-phOLoc&t=581.16s)]
