Video Description: Three Israeli hostages have been handed to the Red Cross in Gaza, before their transfer to Israel, the Israeli military confirms.

Before the handover, Hamas named them as 31-year-old Doron Steinbrecher, dual British-Israeli Emily Damari, 28, and 24-year-old Romi Gonen.

Hamas says for every hostage released, 30 Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails. 

The long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza came into force after a last minute delay, with displace Palestinians beginning to return to the cities they fled.

# Israel says it has received three hostages, after they were released in Gaza ceasefire | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4)
*  The IDF, the Israel Defence Forces have made an announcement now saying that the Red Cross [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=0.0s)]
*  has communicated that the three Israeli hostages were transferred to them and are on their [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=5.72s)]
*  way towards IDF and ISA forces in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=10.56s)]
*  So basically the pictures that you are still seeing in the background here, that is a loop [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=14.84s)]
*  of a handover that has already happened and those Red Cross vehicles are now moving through [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=20.36s)]
*  Gaza towards that handover point. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=26.68s)]
*  Now as Jonah was explaining there, everything has been put in place. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=30.2s)]
*  This was a process that was actually used during the last ceasefire where Hamas hands [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=34.56s)]
*  the hostages over to the Red Cross as we've been seeing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  We've seen in the past different routes being used. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=46.32s)]
*  There was one particular occasion, one hostage release where they actually brought a different [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=48.84s)]
*  route out of Gaza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=53.04s)]
*  Instead of being taken down to the south, they were actually brought out through a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=54.08s)]
*  much quicker route halfway down the strip because one of the hostages needed urgent [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=58.0s)]
*  medical attention. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=63.08s)]
*  But the way that these things normally work is that they go down, they are handed over [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=64.08s)]
*  to IDF forces and we've been watching those live pictures as well of Reim in the south [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=68.24s)]
*  of Israel where the Israel defence forces will take possession, if you like, of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=73.8s)]
*  hostages. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=83.16s)]
*  They will check them over and then they will take them as quickly as possible. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  They take them by helicopter just to make that journey as quick as possible. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  They will take them to Sheba Hospital where we were seeing and hearing Jonah just a few [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=93.0s)]
*  minutes ago and then that process of rehabilitation, of medical treatment but also crucially of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=98.28s)]
*  reuniting them with their families. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=105.16s)]
*  That will begin. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=108.04s)]
*  One element of what is happening just at the moment. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=109.04s)]
*  Also we've been watching the scenes at Offa Prison as well in the occupied West Bank where [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=112.48s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners will be released, they will climb onto buses and they will be taken [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=116.16s)]
*  to also be reunited with their loved ones as well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=122.4s)]
*  You can see the pictures of preparations there at Offa Prison. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=126.64s)]
*  Things happen in a certain order as well. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=129.72s)]
*  The music is getting very loud by the way, as you can hear behind me. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=132.76s)]
*  It happens in a certain order and the handover of the hostages has to happen before the release [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=137.48s)]
*  of the Palestinian prisoners. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=143.28s)]
*  But let's just have a listen to what people in Jerusalem had to say about the ceasefire [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=144.56s)]
*  deal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=150.4s)]
*  The hostages have to come back. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=151.4s)]
*  It's a very, very difficult deal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=154.36s)]
*  Lots of terrorists are being released and it's terrible but we have no option. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=157.08s)]
*  And another thing is that it's not such a great deal for us either. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm just praying that most of the hostages come home alive, please God, and that this [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  suffering ends for them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  We release killers, they will come back to kill. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  We know it for sure and it's very hard what we are doing and it's very hard. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=175.44000000000003s)]
*  We're dealing with the terrorists. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  They're cheating us every time again and again and we feel very, very heavy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=183.32s)]
*  It's like a heavy feeling. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=188.68s)]
*  I can't do nothing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=189.88s)]
*  I'm always thinking about the terrorists going back to Jerusalem. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=191.4s)]
*  The way I see it, it's between a bad deal to the worst deal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=197.32s)]
*  Unfortunately we're going to do that but it's very, very hard. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=205.68s)]
*  God is really happy about what's going to happen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=211.88s)]
*  We're happy to release the hostages. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=214.44s)]
*  We're really happy to have them home but we know what the cost is going to be. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=216.16s)]
*  Well that is what people in Jerusalem were saying a little earlier today about that ceasefire [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=223.28s)]
*  and you saw and heard the atmosphere there and I just want to show you and really bring [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  you into this picture that you're seeing here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=237.24s)]
*  It's not officially called Hostages Square in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=240.64s)]
*  It's the square outside the Tel Aviv Museum of Art but it is a place that has become synonymous [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  with the Israeli hostages in the 470 days since they were taken and you can hear the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=249.32s)]
*  very loud music that's being played. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=256.64s)]
*  Many people have got their phone torches in the air. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=258.88s)]
*  They're joining in. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=261.32s)]
*  They're singing with this music. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=262.32s)]
*  The volume has really been turned up just in the last few minutes and that has coincided [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=263.84s)]
*  with the announcement from the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces, that those three hostages [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=269.92s)]
*  have been handed across. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's have a look at pictures in Rayim. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=281.08s)]
*  Rayim in the south of Israel is where those hostages are going to be handed over and also [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=285.68s)]
*  offer prison in the occupied West Bank as well. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  We were looking earlier on at the buses there that will be used to take Palestinian prisoners [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=294.56s)]
*  to reunite them with their families. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=299.68s)]
*  So there are a few different things going on at the moment. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=302.36s)]
*  We're going to be bringing you obviously live pictures from those different locations as [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=306.12s)]
*  we're speaking so you can see exactly what's happening. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=309.6s)]
*  So this is of the prison that you're watching at the moment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=314.44s)]
*  We saw some people gathering there earlier on today waiting for that handover, essentially [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=317.36s)]
*  that freeing of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  Around 90 of them are supposed to be released as part of the first phase of this deal. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=326.28s)]
*  30 or so Palestinian prisoners for every Israeli hostage who's being released today. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  The majority of them today, we're told, are women with around 10 or so men. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=336.52s)]
*  But as you can see the scene behind me here, the sound that you're also hearing now as [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  well, that is Israeli TV news which is being broadcast on the big screen there behind me. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=348.32s)]
*  People now going very quiet to listen to what's being said, to listen to sort of every crumb [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=356.6s)]
*  of information as it's imparted there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=362.6s)]
*  So you can see really it is a lot busier. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=370.68s)]
*  I've been talking to you all day today from here in Hostages Square and you can really [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=372.68s)]
*  see how the numbers have swelled from earlier on today. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=378.0s)]
*  This is often a place that people are drawn to. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=382.1s)]
*  They've held regular rallies here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=387.54s)]
*  Every Saturday night, there was one yesterday evening as well, where people come. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=390.3s)]
*  Often they're addressed by families of the hostages. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=396.14000000000004s)]
*  There've been released hostages who have come here and taken to the stage and actually addressed [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=399.94s)]
*  the crowds here as well. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  When you look around this place as well, you are surrounded by the faces and the images [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=408.42s)]
*  and the names of those hostages. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=413.42s)]
*  It's been such an integral part of the Israeli consciousness for the last 15 months while [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=416.46000000000004s)]
*  this war has gone on. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=422.62s)]
*  And a lot of the pressure on the Israeli government has come from here as well. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=424.18s)]
*  People here, some of those hostage families have been unhappy with the government's handling [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=428.98s)]
*  of this day. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=434.46s)]
*  They feel like it should have taken 470 days for their loved ones to be released. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=435.46s)]
*  They wanted to see a deal achieved far sooner. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=439.58s)]
*  So there's been a lot of emotion this war. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=443.38s)]
*  I remember the time of the last ceasefire when there was almost a celebratory atmosphere, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=445.09999999999997s)]
*  a relief as people were being released last time round. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=451.38s)]
*  This has been a scene at times of anger as well. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=454.94s)]
*  What it is at the moment is people gathering in quite some numbers, watching and waiting [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=458.62s)]
*  as the three Israeli hostages who've been released today, who we now know are with the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=465.5s)]
*  Red Cross, are making their way towards the southern part of Gaza where they'll be handed [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=471.14000000000004s)]
*  over to the Israeli military and that process will begin to actually get them back onto [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=477.74s)]
*  Israeli soil. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=484.1s)]
*  And then of course the release of Palestinian prisoners will begin as well. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=485.54s)]
*  And I think Lis Ducet, our chief international correspondent who's still with us, I think [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=489.34s)]
*  there's a sense of relief for many people at this point because, you know, 10 or so [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=493.66s)]
*  hours ago it looked like this deal may falter before it even began. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=499.18s)]
*  People thought that they might not see what they're seeing now at Ofer prison here in [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=504.58s)]
*  Tel Aviv. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=509.66s)]
*  And I think there is a huge amount of relief that this ceasefire did come into place. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=510.66s)]
*  And so far is holding and appears to be going according to that very delicate and detailed plan. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=515.0200000000001s)]
*  Yes, and the hours it has taken from the moment where the ceasefire finally began after a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=524.3000000000001s)]
*  three-hour delay, the process began of handing over three women, the first three hostages, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=530.7s)]
*  to be released in this first phase, which is called the humanitarian phase, in exchange [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=537.5s)]
*  for 30 Palestinian prisoners, for three Israeli hostages. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=542.34s)]
*  And we understand that there will be 50 Palestinian prisoners released for every Israeli female [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=548.9s)]
*  soldier who is expected to be released in this first phase. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=554.98s)]
*  And now it's just down to the final minutes and these extraordinary scenes on it where [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=559.38s)]
*  you are. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=564.18s)]
*  Everyone could be watching that at home, but this desire to be there, to be in that square [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=565.18s)]
*  where so many people, as you mentioned, have gone there. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=570.4200000000001s)]
*  Some people have been going there day after day because it is a place where they have [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=573.86s)]
*  found solace, where they have been able to raise their voices. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=578.1800000000001s)]
*  As you say, the mood in that square has changed over the last 15 months. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=582.58s)]
*  Now there's been a lot of anger because when they hear reports that the ceasefire, which [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=588.6600000000001s)]
*  was finally agreed, was a ceasefire which was on the table in May, so said President [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=593.34s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=598.36s)]
*  And they feel that time has been wasted, lives have been lost, Palestinian lives have been [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=599.36s)]
*  lost in the thousands. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  So too, they're not sure how many Israeli hostages would have died in captivity. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=606.4s)]
*  But these are these final moments where moments of tension, moments of happiness, people holding [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=612.52s)]
*  their breath. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=618.72s)]
*  And this will be watched across Israel, a nation where it's extraordinary that, you [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=619.72s)]
*  know, in Israel they say, as you've heard it so many times, Anne, how the country believes [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=626.28s)]
*  that they changed forever after October the 7th, everywhere you go. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=630.92s)]
*  And today in that square, the banners of the hostages, they line all the streets and squares [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=634.92s)]
*  in Tel Aviv, in many other cities, they line the hallways in Israel's, the international [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=640.32s)]
*  airport in Ben Gurion just outside Tel Aviv. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=646.0s)]
*  They feel that these are their sisters and brothers and family members, that there's [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=649.66s)]
*  been this solidarity and solidarity among the families too. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=654.9s)]
*  And people will be watching around the world because this is such as one of those exquisite [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=658.94s)]
*  human moments of rare happiness, which will give rise to cautious hope that this can be [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=663.98s)]
*  the beginning of something where all of the hostages will go home. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=671.98s)]
*  Those who are alive and the remains of those who did not survive so that their family knows [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=676.94s)]
*  at least what happened. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=681.9s)]
*  And then the hundreds of Palestinian prisoners who will go home, many of them have been languishing [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=683.52s)]
*  in prison under administrative detention, not yet being charged, never knowing when [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=688.86s)]
*  they would be free. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=694.76s)]
*  This is a time of intense emotion on both sides in this deeply, deeply political deal, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=696.0s)]
*  in a war that this region has never, the likes of which the region has never seen, and so [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=704.8s)]
*  many hope that there will be an end to that war, but it's fraught with risk. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=710.2s)]
*  But this moment is one, a very, very human moment. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=718.2s)]
*  And you can see from the reaction here, you can see from people's faces, you can see families [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=721.0s)]
*  holding each other, parents putting their arms around children, people wrapped looking [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=726.2s)]
*  at the screen, cheering, those explosive impressions of joy. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  And they saw just the smallest, smallest moment, the suggestion that those women were being [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=737.88s)]
*  handed over, somebody's back in a vehicle and the way that people cheered and whooped. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=742.2800000000001s)]
*  While we're speaking, Lisa, as well, we're staying on these live pictures of Reim in [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=747.52s)]
*  southern Israel, that we're seeing minibuses pulling up to the helicopters, because the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=751.64s)]
*  next stage will be to take those three hostages to Sheba Hospital, where preparations have [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=757.1600000000001s)]
*  been put in place to receive them. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=764.5s)]
*  And then also after that, again, as you were saying, Lisa, we will see the release of 90 [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=767.28s)]
*  or so Palestinian prisoners today. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=772.8s)]
*  And this is something that the deal has on repeat, isn't it? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=775.36s)]
*  It's three phases, but this first phase, this first six weeks, 42 days, there's a lot of [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=779.36s)]
*  movement like this to come if all goes well, isn't there? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=785.96s)]
*  Yes, three every Saturday for the next several weeks, and then perhaps on the last Saturday [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=789.64s)]
*  at what's supposed to be the end of this first phase, the remaining alive, women and children, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=798.6s)]
*  the elderly will be released. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=806.24s)]
*  And then that will, well, the discussion, the negotiations, which are certain to be [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=809.0s)]
*  very, very difficult, far more difficult than for this first phase, 16 days into this process [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=814.24s)]
*  as well, the negotiations will begin on that second phase, where they will then discuss [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=819.5s)]
*  the freeing of the male soldiers. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=824.42s)]
*  And Hamas, in this terrible, terrible trade in human lives, will be demanding a higher [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=826.74s)]
*  number of prisoners, because they see them as, and it's horrible to be able to say it, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=833.7s)]
*  but such is the nature of this merciless war that, and Palestinians describe the people [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=838.1s)]
*  in prison, their people in prisons as hostages too, being held there against as well, not [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=844.66s)]
*  being charged. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=849.0999999999999s)]
*  And so there's a price in this process. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=850.0999999999999s)]
*  So in that second phase, it will be the male soldiers. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=852.4599999999999s)]
*  And that's why, Anna, we've been hearing, you've been hearing when you speak to people [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=855.9s)]
*  that of those holding their breath, it is the people who know, whose male relatives [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=859.5799999999999s)]
*  who are soldiers or who are young, they know they will not be released in this first phase. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=865.18s)]
*  They share the joy of the families who will share their love, because it's been this intense [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=870.4s)]
*  coming together of all the families, sharing in their joys, even those who've lost their [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=874.94s)]
*  loved ones, they rejoice when they see someone else's relative, sister, daughter, grandfather, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=880.3000000000001s)]
*  father coming home, because they somehow feel that that's something for them as well, even [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=887.42s)]
*  though their own relative didn't survive this ordeal. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=893.62s)]
*  And so today, there will be rejoicing among all the hostage families, even those who are [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=899.02s)]
*  hoping against hope that this moves to the second phase and that there is a chance in [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=904.5400000000001s)]
*  the second phase after those first 42 days, if all goes smoothly, that there will be then [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=910.22s)]
*  the beginning of a process that they too can have an evening like this, where they are [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=917.22s)]
*  within literally touching distance of embracing their loved ones again. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=922.5s)]
*  It's something that they've every day, they've lived this nightmare of never knowing whether [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=927.5s)]
*  they're here and they still don't know whether their loved ones will finally come home alive. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=931.86s)]
*  We were talking earlier here in the square to exactly one of those mums, her son Tamir, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=938.86s)]
*  a soldier, he was based at Erez that day, she was saying that she has heard nothing, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=944.3000000000001s)]
*  nothing at all, doesn't know if he is alive, doesn't know if he's been killed in captivity, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=949.7s)]
*  but something she said was really interesting and she was absolutely sharing those sentiments [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=954.0600000000001s)]
*  that you described there, the joy for fellow hostage families, people who have been bound [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=959.1s)]
*  together by these most traumatic circumstances, who have gained strength and support from [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=964.46s)]
*  each other, but what she was saying she was worried about is the fewer hostages that are [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=970.62s)]
*  still being held. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=975.46s)]
*  She was concerned that attention would be drawn away, international pressure would be [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=976.46s)]
*  drawn away as those numbers of hostages being held in Gaza dwindled, because that's been [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=981.3s)]
*  a big part of this, hasn't it? That's why hostage families have talked about their ordeal, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=986.0999999999999s)]
*  that's why they've been so keen to put the pictures, the images of their loved ones in [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=992.3399999999999s)]
*  the public eye, because they know that often it is international pressure that leads to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=996.8599999999999s)]
*  a breakthrough like this one. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1002.54s)]
*  Yes, they must be hoping tonight that in being part of this extraordinary moment, this rollercoaster [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1006.06s)]
*  of a moment, that the nation will rally then and will demand with even stronger voice that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1014.06s)]
*  this process has to continue, that the hostages must be made the priority in these efforts [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1021.06s)]
*  to try to end the war. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1028.06s)]
*  And we've seen, Anna, even senior Israeli generals and the Israeli defence forces, even [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1030.06s)]
*  the defence minister who eventually was let go, Yoav Galan, saying that we've achieved [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1036.06s)]
*  everything we can militarily in Gaza, we must put the lives of the hostages first. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1042.06s)]
*  And it is, as you say, it has been the hostages' family, not just gathering in Hostages Square, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1047.06s)]
*  those marches that they've done, they were joined at one point by the history trade unions, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1052.06s)]
*  the largest trade union in Israel, people coming together and raising their voice, marching [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1057.06s)]
*  towards Jerusalem to the prime minister's residence, who of course has been saying that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1061.06s)]
*  he has been putting the lives of the hostages first, that there was two war aims, as he [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1066.06s)]
*  has said repeatedly, to destroy Hamas and to bring the hostages home. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1071.06s)]
*  But there is so much bitterness and anger, as you've heard yourself, among the hostages' [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1075.06s)]
*  family. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1080.06s)]
*  They feel that they have been sacrificed and that the lives of their loved ones have not [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1081.06s)]
*  been put first. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1086.06s)]
*  And yes, there is this fear that once the women, the children, the elderly come home, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1087.06s)]
*  the most, the more vulnerable hostages come home, that once it gets to the soldiers, the [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1092.06s)]
*  male soldiers, that interest will not be sustained. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1097.06s)]
*  But there is a hope in this process that even though we hear about the risks, that once [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1102.06s)]
*  it starts, and it's clearly starting now in all its intensity, that there will be a momentum [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1107.06s)]
*  and it will be very difficult to stop this process as it starts moving in this direction. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1113.06s)]
*  And certainly we heard today from the Qatari government spokesman Majed Al Ansari, Qatari [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1118.06s)]
*  in Egypt are now going to play, they played a key role in the mediation, which got to [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1123.06s)]
*  this point. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1127.06s)]
*  They will now play a key role in the implementation of it, for watching for the violations, having [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1128.06s)]
*  people on the ground to improve the logistics. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1133.06s)]
*  They are calling them for international pressure. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1136.06s)]
*  They are hoping that the new administration, which takes charge tomorrow in the White House, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1138.06s)]
*  that they won't stop at simply pushing this, helping to push. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1143.06s)]
*  And they played a big role in pushing it over the line. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1146.06s)]
*  President-elect Trump saying, I want it done by the 20th. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1149.06s)]
*  Well, it has been done by the 20th, but they will have to be there at the table, putting [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1152.06s)]
*  pressure on both sides to keep this process going. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1157.06s)]
*  There are so many dangers along the way, but people must be hoping against hope tonight [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1161.06s)]
*  that this will continue. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAo7xOG0Pa4&t=1167.06s)]
