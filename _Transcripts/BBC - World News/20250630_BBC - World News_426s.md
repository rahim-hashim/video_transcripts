# What you need to know about the Land Back movement in New Zealand | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw)
*  Let's look now at a BBC World Service podcast that's running later today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's going to look at the land back movement where indigenous groups seek to reclaim control [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=4.0s)]
*  and governance over their ancestral lands taken from them around the world. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=8.88s)]
*  This program will highlight the movement in North America where nearly 99% of indigenous [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=13.44s)]
*  land has been seized since the arrival of European colonizers. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=18.16s)]
*  There have been similar issues facing the Māori in New Zealand, Aotearoa, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=21.76s)]
*  who have been fighting to reclaim land confiscated more than 150 years ago. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=25.52s)]
*  Well let's cross over to Aotearoa, New Zealand and go to Queenstown. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=31.12s)]
*  We can speak to Claire Charters who is a Māori academic who specialises in indigenous people's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=34.72s)]
*  legal rights, also a former advisor to the UN General Assembly and our news reporter [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=39.28s)]
*  who has also worked on this podcast, Vanessa Igoe. Good to have you both with us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Claire, can I start with you? Before we talk about the Māori claim over land, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  they're pushed to get it back. Can you explain to us, Claire, what land actually means for Māori? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=53.84s)]
*  Well I think land for different Māori means different things for different tribes but [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  overall we see, well we understand land to be papatūānuku which is Earth's mother. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  Might be an okay translation I guess. So she is our ancestor, she is someone we need to look [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=72.64s)]
*  after as we would our relation. So you know her importance is not just as a resource or something [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=78.88s)]
*  to walk across. Her importance is deeply embedded in our culture and our understanding of ourselves [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=86.16s)]
*  and our spiritual world. So what does this phrase Claire to you mean, this land back phrase? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=93.6s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Well you know it is to me basically a euphemism for decolonisation of some form or [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=100.56s)]
*  other. I think it extends beyond the actual giving the land back or title to land. I think it means [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=109.52s)]
*  something more like transformation of governance of societies so that you decolonise in some way [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=117.04s)]
*  or form. So in Aotearoa we often think about constitutional transformation to become less [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=124.32s)]
*  of a sort of Westminster type constitutional system to something that is more pluralist. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  But then of course you know land back is part of this, the spaces where we can practice and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=136.56s)]
*  revive our culture, spaces where we can also try and find some economic benefit to deal with, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=142.24s)]
*  you know poverty, that we're some of the sickest in the country, that we die earlier and that sort [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=150.16s)]
*  of thing. So it's a very broad term and it definitely extends but far beyond the idea of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=155.76s)]
*  title transferring over. Vanessa one of the things we're looking at a lot today is climate change [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=162.48s)]
*  because of the heat that we're experiencing in Europe. What are the potential benefits in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=168.88s)]
*  terms of the climate change, the movement to sort of stop climate change when it comes to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=174.24s)]
*  indigenous people? Yeah when indigenous people reclaim the land they use traditional techniques [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=178.4s)]
*  like controlling for wildfires and conserving animals and that's often been found to be useful [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=183.68s)]
*  to adapt and mitigate climate change and this is being seen by environmental bodies like the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=189.36s)]
*  United Nations and the IPCC report and one of these examples that we actually looked at in the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=193.44s)]
*  podcast was that the Nari Nari people in Australia, they won back land in Australia and went back [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=198.0s)]
*  to the wetlands and all of the animals had disappeared because of irrigation systems [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  and they took apart all of these water systems and the water began flowing again and all the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=206.8s)]
*  animals came back. So this is a trend that's actually being seen across different countries [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=210.72s)]
*  like Australia, Brazil and Canada. Claire can I ask you about the treaty principles Bill? I mean [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  you'll need to explain it to our international viewers. There is a treaty, a founding treaty in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  New Zealand, the Treaty of Waitangi but there has been so much controversy around this bill and it [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=226.0s)]
*  was defeated. How much has that brought this whole issue though into the public domain again in New [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=230.24s)]
*  Zealand and where is the debate at? Well the treaty principles Bill was incredibly divisive. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  What it tried to do was I guess legislatively define what the treaty means whereas we do have [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  a treaty that talks about the sharing of authority in New Zealand, our founding constitutional [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=251.52s)]
*  document and what the government was trying to do was say that it means in legislation something [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=258.24s)]
*  completely different, something about equality between peoples rather than the sharing of power. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=264.56s)]
*  So it was quite controversial for that reason but also because it really picked up on I guess fear [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=271.2s)]
*  of recognition of Māori rights on the one hand but also you know it really undermined the movement [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=281.28s)]
*  for greater recognition of Māori rights as well so it really brought those that tension to the fore [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=288.64s)]
*  which was very problematic and has not been a great experience for New Zealand or New Zealanders. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=294.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah as Claire was saying Vanessa there was a lot of tension as a result of this because there is [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  criticism isn't there of this land back movement not just in New Zealand but in other countries? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=307.36s)]
*  Yeah absolutely so the land back movement isn't without its criticisms there are people that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  believe that because this took place hundreds of years ago they shouldn't have to give the land back. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=315.92s)]
*  Also big businesses feel that land is actually valuable to things like farming and mining and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=320.24s)]
*  logging and governments aren't always uniform in their approach to this. Some governments actually [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=325.36s)]
*  encourage indigenous people to buy back the land like we see in the US in Fiji they have buyback [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=330.24s)]
*  schemes but then there are some that disagree with the land backs claims to want to govern the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=334.32s)]
*  land and we can see that with New Zealand Paul Goldsmith the treaty negotiations minister actually [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=339.36s)]
*  released a statement saying that the crown is sovereign in response to Māori claims saying that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  they've never ceded sovereignty to the crown over the land. Claire you've advised the UN General [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=349.12s)]
*  Assembly on these issues how receptive do you find international bodies at the moment? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=354.56s)]
*  Well it varies I mean there are so many different international bodies and I think was just [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=360.8s)]
*  mentioned earlier the climate change and the climate change context I think indigenous [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  people's voices are really heard because there's an understanding that our history our knowledge [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=370.48s)]
*  can be very useful in dealing with climate change consequences and mitigation and so on. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=376.32s)]
*  I think at the General Assembly level I was working on a particular project around enhancements [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=383.44s)]
*  indigenous people's participation at the United Nations. I think these things go back and forward [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=389.12s)]
*  but there is some tension around recognizing indigenous people's self-determination and I [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=396.08s)]
*  think we don't have to look far globally to understand that the concept of self-determination [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=401.44s)]
*  is a very live issue globally but there are also in the human rights domain I think there are some [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=406.48s)]
*  advances particularly but it depends on institution and topic really. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=414.96s)]
*  Claire really good to talk to you thanks for joining us. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayf-FbSxgiw&t=420.64s)]
