*  The UN Secretary General has expressed his deep concerns over tensions between India [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=0.0s)]
*  and Pakistan after the deadly attack on 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir. India [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  accuses Pakistan of being indirectly involved and says two suspects are Pakistani nationals. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=11.22s)]
*  India has suspended a landmark water treaty in response. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=17.68s)]
*  Bilawar Bhutto Zardari is chairman of the coalition party PPP and is the former foreign [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=21.72s)]
*  minister. He was asked about his remarks that if water doesn't flow to Pakistan, India's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=27.48s)]
*  blood will. But first, he rejected India's allegations and told the BBC's Pakistan correspondent [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=32.04s)]
*  Azad Amashiri that Pakistan is being scapegoated. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=38.18s)]
*  The Prime Minister has already offered for there to be an impartial investigation in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Pakistan. We, unlike many other countries across the world, have actually learned our [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=48.0s)]
*  And in the context of these same sort of linkages that these accusations that have existed in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=53.32s)]
*  the past, Pakistan has also undergone its own internal reform. So much so that before [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=59.6s)]
*  I was foreign minister, Pakistan was on the FATF gray list. While I was foreign minister, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=64.36s)]
*  Pakistan exited the FATF gray list, which means the international community also accepts [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  that Pakistan has no connection as of today to any such group. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=76.48s)]
*  But the State Department's most recent report still says there are terror groups like the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=80.96s)]
*  Shia-Tabarn Jain present. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=86.18s)]
*  I'm not going to go and litigate the details of the State Department report and the issues [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=87.92s)]
*  we have with that. The point that I'm trying to make is Pakistan has learned its lessons. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=94.5s)]
*  It's moved on from this, which is an old chapter in our history. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=100.08s)]
*  The Indian government and the Indian military is putting out so many statements. Every single [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=105.04s)]
*  day they are accusing Pakistan of initiating unprovoked gunfire across the line of control [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=109.46s)]
*  and initiating firing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=116.46s)]
*  There's no reason for Pakistan to want to... [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  Why is Pakistan not answering? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=119.86s)]
*  What is it for Pakistan to gain? In A, having a terrorist attack like this in Makhbuz-e-Kashmir, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=122.22s)]
*  or for us to initiate firing on the line of control? I know without hesitation that Pakistan [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  would just be responding to firings from the Indian side. In fact, at the end of the day, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=134.9s)]
*  the Indian side that's emotional right now is the Indian side that's being irrational [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  right now. I believe that Pakistan has responded very calmly to a whole host of absurd accusations. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=144.16s)]
*  You don't feel emotional right now? The reason I ask is because you made those comments over [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=152.1s)]
*  the weekend, and it was in reference to India's decision to unilaterally suspend the landmark [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  water treaty. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=163.66s)]
*  You said either water will flow or their blood will, referring to India. Do you think [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=164.64s)]
*  that's an unemotional, calm way of responding when tensions are so high? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=170.32s)]
*  I'm not stationed on the border with a gun in my hand. I don't hold any position in [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=174.64s)]
*  government. I was speaking to a political rally on the banks of the river Indus the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  day of or the day after this water treaty was violated by India. I think it was a post [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=183.72s)]
*  not only a rational reaction from my side, but an articulation of the feelings of the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=191.12s)]
*  people of Pakistan and my own people whom I was addressing. The government that is in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=197.24s)]
*  power has said that any decision that would implement the withdrawal from the Indus water [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=201.84s)]
*  treaty would be considered an act of war. As I'm sure you're aware, when there is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=209.78s)]
*  water, blood does flow. We don't have any rivers to shut off as a response to India. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=214.0s)]
*  It would mean an act of war if India was to weaponize water against the people of Pakistan. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6AzH0PW5P8&t=222.36s)]
