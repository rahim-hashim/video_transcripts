*  air and spinning. People started to fall off too because the chairs were bouncing. We all ran as [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=60.56s)]
*  fast as we could and left our skis behind. There were boards falling down. Let's speak to Jaime [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=68.08s)]
*  Pellegri who is at the Aston ski resort and was on the ski lift when it collapsed. Jaime thank you [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=75.04s)]
*  very much for joining us here on BBC News. Tell us what you saw, what happened to you? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=81.44000000000001s)]
*  Well hi everyone. It's been a very shocking day. So we were skiing as we normally do on weekends [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  in the Astur resort and suddenly we were in the dirt and it started to fall. It was very quick, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  everything happened in like seconds and we were lucky because in my case this chair was just at [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=103.44s)]
*  the beginning and we kind of took the floor. So we reached the floor with the chair and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=110.8s)]
*  everything happened in like seconds. So unfortunately we felt okay, no injuries and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=119.6s)]
*  the people surrounding us in the different chairs were okay but it's not been the case in the upper [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=127.6s)]
*  part of the chair where some injuries and some serious injuries happened. What did you see in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=132.96s)]
*  terms of how far people were falling? So in my case we had to take the chair like 15 to 20 seconds [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  before so it was six to seven meters up and my feeling was like a free fall, like you know free [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=153.44s)]
*  fall very quick, very fast until I think some security system probably functioned or because [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  when we reached the floor or the snow in this case and it was not that fast so it slowed down a bit [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=170.88s)]
*  but I think that in the upper part of the chair probably the distance to the snow was over 10 for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=179.28s)]
*  sure and 15 meters distance so really scary thing. Obviously the cause of this accident isn't yet [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=187.04s)]
*  known but could you see a cable come loose? We very fast again but we could say like the cable [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=195.76s)]
*  lost the tensity or yeah it started to break completely but maybe suddenly something happened [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=207.12s)]
*  for sure and in a matter of seconds the chairs in our side with the people who were going up [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=215.28s)]
*  started to fall at the same time altogether so yeah again very scary but very quick, very fast. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=223.12s)]
*  We've just been watching on a little bit of a loop some of the footage that you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=230.72s)]
*  filmed on your phone. Tell us how quick, here it is now, tell us how quickly help arrived because [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=235.27999999999997s)]
*  the conditions are excellent for skiing for sure and I imagine it could have been very busy this [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=245.2s)]
*  weekend. Yeah because again yeah the conditions were very very nice, it was called a very sunny day [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=252.56s)]
*  so a lot of people in the in the resort and my immediate reaction because I actually got [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=261.76000000000005s)]
*  attached to the chair so I had to get out of the chair on my own and I couldn't because the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=269.6s)]
*  distance once the chair rebounded it was like less than a meter away so we tried to help others [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  surrounding us but everyone was okay and then in a matter of like 10 to 15 minutes I think [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  the resort closed and they announced that it was going to close and then immediately we started to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=289.76s)]
*  see some ambulances come in and then helicopters and when we saw over four or five helicopters [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=296.96s)]
*  that's where we realized how important and how relevant the accident had been [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=305.28s)]
*  again for us was very lucky that we were in the safest place. There are reports that some people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=310.8s)]
*  were trapped on the chairlift after the accident happened for some time, do you do you know anything [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=318.24s)]
*  about them are they now down and safe? I mean the latest that I know is first all the rescue services [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=326.08s)]
*  were attending the injuries and we saw some and so some people injured in going you know down [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  helped by others and going down the resort to immediately go to ambulances to different [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=341.04s)]
*  hospitals in the region and that like one hour ago and the people in the chair were still there [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=347.36s)]
*  and I think the again the emergency systems were preparing a protocol to kind of rescue everyone [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=354.48s)]
*  hopefully before it's night time and we have still the sun there because it's cold in here so [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  that's going to be a difficult rescue for sure. And in terms of how those of you who thankfully [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=370.16s)]
*  were not hurt what help did you get were you were you advised and and moved away told to leave? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=376.8s)]
*  Yeah immediately again we tried to help the others and then we saw people working from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=385.6s)]
*  from the resort coming and in different transportation methods and you know with snow [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=392.72s)]
*  motorbikes and by foot and some of them were asking everyone if we were safe and then going up [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  asking turn by turn if people were feeling safe and yeah everyone kind of tried to move immediately [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=408.4s)]
*  then there was an announcement of evacuation of the of the resource so they could work better on [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=415.28s)]
*  the rescue and in transporting transporting the injured people who I believe some of them were [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  even evacuated in helicopter. Yes that's certainly the report that we've heard. Jaime we're really [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oIZN3sEPk&t=428.96s)]
