Video Description: India and the US need to work together successfully for a "prosperous and peaceful" 21st Century, US Vice-President JD Vance said in a speech calling for closer ties between the countries across sectors.
 
Vance, who is on a four-day visit to India, was speaking at a programme in the western city of Jaipur.
 
"But I also believe that if we fail to work together successfully, the 21st Century could be a very dark time for all of humanity," he added.
 
The vice-president's remarks came a day after he met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and both countries said they had made progress in negotiating a bilateral trade deal which Delhi hopes will help it avoid higher tariffs.

**BBC - World News:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0)
*  The Kashmir attack comes as the US Vice President J.D. Vance is in India to finalise the terms of a bilateral trade deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=0.0s)]
*  Both countries are aiming to grow bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=7.12s)]
*  But US tariffs on Indian imports threaten that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=12.88s)]
*  Goods from India are grappling with tariffs of 10% and could go as high as 26% if no agreement is reached. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=16.28s)]
*  After conversations with President Modi yesterday, Monday, J.D. Vance addressed business leaders earlier today to share more details about the prospective bilateral trade deal between both countries. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=23.92s)]
*  Today I come here with a simple message. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=36.04s)]
*  Our administration seeks trade partners on the basis of fairness and of shared national interests. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=38.44s)]
*  We want to build relationships with our foreign partners who respect their workers, who don't suppress their wages to boost exports, but respect the value of their labour. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=45.4s)]
*  We want partners that are committed to working with America to build things, not just allowing themselves to become a conduit for transshipping others' goods. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=55.36s)]
*  And finally, we want to partner with people and countries who recognise the historic nature of the moment we're in, of the need to come together and build something truly new. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=64.0s)]
*  A system of global trade that is balanced, one that is open, and one that is stable and fair. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Now I want to be clear, America's partners need not look exactly like America, nor must our governments do everything exactly the same way. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=84.72s)]
*  But we should have some common goals, and I believe here in India we do, in both economics and in national security. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=94.44s)]
*  And that's why we're so excited. That's why I'm so excited to be here today. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=102.24s)]
*  In India, America has a friend and we seek to strengthen the warm bonds our great nations already share. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=106.12s)]
*  JD, Vance speaking earlier today. We will be back in a few moments with more on the run up to Donald Trump's 100 days testing the waters in Ohio and sampling public opinion there around the world and across the UK. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UFIRQ93A0&t=113.48s)]
