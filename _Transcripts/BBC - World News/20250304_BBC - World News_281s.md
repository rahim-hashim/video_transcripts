Video Description: The leader of armed rebels that have taken control of two cities in the Democratic Republic of Congo has threatened to march on the nations capital of Kinshasa if his forces come under attack by government forces.
 
The M23 rebels have claimed control of the cities of Goma and Bukavu - the two largest cities in the mineral-rich east of the country - where they have been accused of committing human rights abuses.
 
The UN and the US have also accused neighbouring country Rwanda of arming the M23 rebels, something which Rwanda and Congo River Alliance leader Corneille Nangaa has denied.

**BBC - World News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk)
*  Now, the leader of a group of armed rebels who've swept through the east of the Democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=0.0s)]
*  Republic of Congo have told the BBC that they'll go all the way to the capital, Kinshasa, if [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=4.72s)]
*  they come under attack by government forces. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=9.8s)]
*  Well, Cornel Nanga, who heads an alliance which includes the M23 rebel group, claims [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=12.72s)]
*  that they are liberators who are defending themselves against the government. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=20.0s)]
*  The M23 now control Goma and Bukavu, the two largest cities in the mineral-rich east of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=24.48s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=31.48s)]
*  Well, according to the UN and the US, the rebels are backed by neighbouring Rwanda, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  something that Rwanda denies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=37.2s)]
*  Well, speaking to the BBC, Cornel Nanga denies receiving military assistance from Rwanda. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=38.6s)]
*  He also said he had no knowledge of any human rights abuses committed by the M23 group. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  MASSINIA International correspondent Paula Guerin sent us this report. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=51.2s)]
*  Cornel Nanga, the smiling face of the rebels on the march in the DRC, self-proclaimed liberators [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=59.36s)]
*  coming to clean up corruption. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=68.56s)]
*  He says they'll take the fight all the way to the capital, Kinshasa, if, as he claims, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  the government keeps attacking them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=77.98s)]
*  How did the anti-government M23 rebel group get this far? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=81.4s)]
*  With backing, weapons and 4,000 troops from neighbouring Rwanda, UN experts say. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=88.56s)]
*  That's something the rebels deny. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=96.08s)]
*  I don't know anything about Rwanda. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=98.08s)]
*  If they say that there are 4,000 fighters from Rwanda, I don't know, I didn't see them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=102.16s)]
*  So you don't receive any assistance from Rwanda? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=110.6s)]
*  I don't see the military assistance from Rwanda. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  So even though there is photographic evidence of Rwandan troops here in DRC, you say they [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=117.5s)]
*  are not here and not fighting with you? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  They can have their evidence. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  Me, I say that I don't have those evidence. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=126.84s)]
*  I have my fighting area and we have our own reason why we are fighting. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=130.12s)]
*  The M23 have been rounding up recruits to join their fight, willing or otherwise. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=137.76s)]
*  It doesn't pay to disagree. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=146.17999999999998s)]
*  Here police officers who surrendered to the rebels when they took the city of Bukavu are [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=150.6s)]
*  lined up for retraining. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  What choice did we have, one told us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=159.48s)]
*  Little choice at the barrel of a gun. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=162.88s)]
*  The M23 have a history of brutality, like the Congolese army and many armed groups in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=166.32s)]
*  the DRC. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=173.64s)]
*  Human rights groups have accused the M23 over the past few years of a whole range of abuses, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=176.48s)]
*  of systematic shelling, of mass rape, of killing of civilians. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=183.4s)]
*  They say this has been carried out by M23 fighters and they have documented these cases. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=188.88s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=195.76s)]
*  I didn't see the report. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=196.76s)]
*  I cannot respond for the report that I didn't read. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=199.92s)]
*  Are you not worried about these allegations? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=204.44s)]
*  No. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=205.92s)]
*  They've been made for years. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=206.92s)]
*  No. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=207.92s)]
*  I've never read those allegations and also we are also writing our own report for all [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=208.92s)]
*  these issues. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=217.2s)]
*  If a body like the UN or the Red Cross or Amnesty or Human Rights Watch, if all of these [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  people are saying the M23 is carrying out human rights abuses, do you not wish to look [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=224.06s)]
*  into that? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=229.46s)]
*  I think they are not the right people to make a report on this kind of issue. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=230.46s)]
*  But these reports have been made over years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=236.02s)]
*  Why have you not read them until now? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=238.38s)]
*  Give me one and I will be reading it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=240.74s)]
*  I can send you many. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=242.5s)]
*  Please, I appreciate it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  A massive M23 victory rally in Bukavu. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=247.74s)]
*  There were promises of change and development. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=252.86s)]
*  Then suddenly panic. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=257.98s)]
*  Explosions killed 11 people on the spot. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  Neighboring armies are already on the ground here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=266.86s)]
*  There are growing fears that the DRC could once again be at the centre of a regional [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P5qrRQyqSk&t=270.76s)]
