# Syria's Kurds battle Turkey months after Assad's fall | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ)
*  Welcome back. Syria's interim president has promised to form an inclusive government following [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=0.0s)]
*  talks at a landmark national dialogue conference to discuss the country's future following [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=6.12s)]
*  decades of Assad rule. But what does this mean for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=11.16s)]
*  forces who are not present at the talks? Well, Gia Gol has been to Kobani in northeast Syria [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=16.56s)]
*  where fighting is ongoing with Turkish-backed forces to speak to Kurds. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=22.92s)]
*  The iconic city of Kobani, where Kurds resisted a brutal siege by the so-called Islamic State [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=29.96s)]
*  militants ISIS. Now people celebrate the 10th anniversary of their liberation from the terror [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=37.0s)]
*  of ISIS. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=46.84s)]
*  Last night I lit candles for my brother and the martyrs of Kobani. It is both a joyful [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=50.44s)]
*  and a sorrowful day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  But freedom from ISIS didn't bring peace. Now not far from Kobani, fighting between [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=61.32s)]
*  Kurdish-led SDF forces and the Turkish-backed SNA fighters continues. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=69.0s)]
*  Turkish drones have targeted SDF positions, supply routes and even civilian anti-war protests [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=77.24s)]
*  have recently come under fire. In a regional hospital, we met both injured civilians and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=84.4s)]
*  fighters. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=92.08s)]
*  Leah Bonsi, a 28-year-old peace activist from Germany, is a volunteer here at a women's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=95.48s)]
*  shelter. She was one of those civilians calling for an end to the fighting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=101.84s)]
*  Leah shows us a video capturing the moment they were attacked. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  An old man also got injured. I lost some blood. That's why they wanted to send me to the hospital. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  But when we went into the ambulance car, again a drone attack next to our ambulance was happening. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  So we were not able to go to the hospital in this time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  Human Rights Watch condemned the drone attacks on ambulances and the killing of civilians [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=133.56s)]
*  as apparent war crimes committed by the Turkish-SNA correlation. But the Turkish government denies [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=138.32s)]
*  targeting civilians and infrastructure, instead accusing Kurdish forces of using civilians [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=145.56s)]
*  as human shields. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=151.62s)]
*  In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=154.62s)]
*  to bomb us. In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=165.84s)]
*  under our control. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=171.6s)]
*  Kurdish female fighters played a crucial role in defeating Islamist state militants in Syria [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=176.56s)]
*  and are determined to have a voice in Syria's future. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=182.88s)]
*  This Kurdish commander doubts whether the new Islamic government in Damascus will respect [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=189.08s)]
*  women's rights. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=195.56s)]
*  So far we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership. Here we [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=198.64s)]
*  have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social and military life. If [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=210.0s)]
*  This is a common scene in cemeteries across the region. Two Kurdish fighters killed in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=221.0s)]
*  a recent attack are returned for burial. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=228.52s)]
*  Each time I come back, there is a new addition to the cemetery. Many of these fighters survived [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=232.4s)]
*  the fight against ISIS, but I can see fresh graves. Just very recently, they have been [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=238.74s)]
*  killed by Turkish drones and militias supported by Turkey. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=244.96s)]
*  Stability in Syria may be on the horizon, but for the Kurds, the future is uncertain. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=251.36s)]
*  Will they be recognized as partners in a new Syria or face yet another existential war? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=258.6s)]
*  Jirgal, BBC News, Kobani. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAxdPWRi_SQ&t=266.0s)]
