Video Description: The death toll in Myanmar following Friday’s major earthquake has risen to 2,056, the ruling military junta has said.
 
They also say more than 3,900 people are injured, and a further 270 still missing.
 
Getting information out of Myanmar has proven to be difficult and the country’s military leadership has a history of suppressing the scale of national disasters.
 
Foreign aid and rescue teams have joined the effort, with a Chinese team reportedly pulling four people alive from the rubble in Mandalay on Monday.

# Myanmar death toll rises after earthquake, says military government | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII)
*  A child and a pregnant woman are among the survivors of Friday's earthquake in Myanmar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=0.0s)]
*  who have been rescued from the rubble as search and rescue efforts continue. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=4.8s)]
*  The death toll so far stands at more than 2,000 people, but that number comes from the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=8.6s)]
*  ruling military junta which has a history of suppressing the scale of disasters. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=13.36s)]
*  The quake was also felt in neighbouring Thailand from where Nick Marsh sent us this report. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=18.3s)]
*  Prayers for the dead and for those still not found. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=27.08s)]
*  Napier door is around 170 miles from the epicentre of this earthquake, but it wasn't spared [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  from its destruction. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=37.64s)]
*  Our colleagues at the BBC Burmese service have managed to send back these images from [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=39.32s)]
*  Myanmar's capital. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=43.8s)]
*  They say the smell makes it plain that there are still many bodies buried in the rubble. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=45.72s)]
*  Few people in Myanmar are willing to speak to journalists for fear of reprisals from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  the military government, but this woman told the BBC that she and her family are still [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=56.4s)]
*  sleeping on the streets. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=61.4s)]
*  There are aftershocks every two or three hours. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=65.4s)]
*  We cannot expect to rebuild our lives under these circumstances. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=68.12s)]
*  We may have to live in a slum. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=71.68s)]
*  Nothing is left. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=73.6s)]
*  This is the epicentre, Myanmar's second city, Mandalay. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=76.12s)]
*  International aid groups say that hospitals are overwhelmed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=80.56s)]
*  800 miles away in Bangkok, another grim discovery. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=85.56s)]
*  A woman who'd been working at this construction site when a partially built tower came down [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=90.44s)]
*  on Friday. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  She's the 12th person to be found. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  But dozens of workers remain unaccounted for here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=100.16s)]
*  The operation behind me is well into its fourth day and the inevitable question now is when [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=103.68s)]
*  does this stop becoming a search and rescue operation and when does it become search and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=110.18s)]
*  recovery? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=116.18s)]
*  The authorities say not yet. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=117.18s)]
*  We are not going to stop even after 72 hours. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=119.86000000000001s)]
*  We are going to speed up the process because we want to get to them even faster because [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  it's over at the 72 hours. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=126.94000000000001s)]
*  Trying to boost morale, Thailand's prime minister visited the site this morning. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=130.38s)]
*  She's announced an inquiry into why this was the only construction in Bangkok to collapse. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=134.58s)]
*  Investigators are analysing samples of the steel which was used to build the tower. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=141.22s)]
*  It's put people here on edge. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=147.34s)]
*  These workers rushed out of another construction site nearby after rumours of cracks being [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=149.54s)]
*  heard in the office block they were building. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=154.86s)]
*  But it appears to have been a false alarm. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=158.06s)]
*  Thai authorities are urging for calm. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=160.74s)]
*  The city, they say, is safe. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=163.06s)]
*  Given the devastation of the past few days, you can understand the concern. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  Nick Marsh, BBC News, Bangkok. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=171.94s)]
*  Those were daytime pictures from Bangkok. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=175.22s)]
*  We can show you the scene there right now as those rescue efforts continue for the 74 [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=177.26s)]
*  construction workers who are trapped under this rubble of this collapsed high-rise building [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=182.82s)]
*  in Bangkok. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=186.62s)]
*  As Nick was saying, there's been no sign of life in the wreckage for hours. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=187.62s)]
*  The city's deputy governor who has been speaking says they are committed to continue the search. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=191.74s)]
*  It is a very worrying picture there in Bangkok as indeed it is across Myanmar at the moment, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=198.42s)]
*  particularly around the city of Mandalay. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=203.82s)]
*  My colleague Steve Lai, who is also in Bangkok, has been speaking to Kanhee Wignanjara, the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  UN Assistant Secretary-General and Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific at the UN [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=210.82s)]
*  development programme. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=215.42s)]
*  And he began by asking about life in Myanmar even before the earthquake. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=216.78s)]
*  We've got to start with knowing that the population that has been impacted has been living near [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  or below the subsistence line for about four or five years. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  So just think about 75% of the population already living in near relief type situations. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=233.5s)]
*  So this central and north-western region, the hit by this earthquake, it's not enough [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=242.9s)]
*  to get immediate relief. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  One has to because that is life-saving. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=251.9s)]
*  But simultaneously, you've got to look at how recovery can start right away because [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=255.3s)]
*  this is just devastating. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=262.7s)]
*  It's 2000 plus death toll. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  But now we're getting reports from our teams on the ground that if you look at Saga in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=267.5s)]
*  town, about 80% of it is destroyed. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=273.34s)]
*  And what concerns you most now that we are three days from when that earthquake first struck? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=280.38s)]
*  You know, at this stage, I mean, I'm very grateful that the ASEAN countries and China, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=287.18s)]
*  Turkey, Russia, UAE, they've all sent in relief supplies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=294.5s)]
*  And that adds to what the UN teams on the ground and international NGOs are helping with. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  But just think with the two airports taken out, we just heard that the Napido Airport now [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=307.46s)]
*  is up and running, at least some basic, some planes can land there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=313.46s)]
*  But this is a part of the country where we've got to be able to very quickly remove the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=320.82s)]
*  debris so access to the more rural parts that were very affected can also be gotten to. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=328.74s)]
*  So you've got about four million people directly impacted in the more urban cities and towns. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=336.1s)]
*  And then you've got about 10 million people in rural areas that really need immediate help. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=343.22s)]
*  And I'm talking food, water, and the hospitals that were badly damaged, but also electricity. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=351.94000000000005s)]
*  There's power outages. And as I said, this is a population anyway. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=361.62s)]
*  Maybe it was just one third that had access to electricity and the internet. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  So it's a devastating situation. And in the midst of this, you cannot have a resumption of hostilities. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=372.58s)]
*  UN Assistant Secretary-General speaking to Steve there about the devastating picture across Myanmar. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BMSgnX6bII&t=381.21999999999997s)]
