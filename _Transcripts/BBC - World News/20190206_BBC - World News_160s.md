# 'How I survived the Brazil dam collapse' - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0)
*  This little truck here... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=0.0s)]
*  I heard a loud noise. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=12.0s)]
*  At that moment I thought it was the train that was unloading. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=16.0s)]
*  Then I got to a higher point to try to visualize. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=21.0s)]
*  Then I saw that it was coming from that mud. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=26.0s)]
*  I ran to Sebastian, because the dam had broken. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=30.0s)]
*  Then he ran to the truck, tripped, fell. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=34.0s)]
*  And we entered the truck and I tried to get out of the place. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=37.0s)]
*  My intention was to get out of the place. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=42.0s)]
*  But when I walked about 15 meters, I hit the mud in front. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=45.0s)]
*  I made a maneuver in the truck and tried to get out to the other side. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=50.0s)]
*  Then the mud surrounded me on the other side. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=54.0s)]
*  When I saw that it was no longer working, I stopped. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=56.0s)]
*  Then I told my colleague, now there is no way. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=60.0s)]
*  It is to wait for an impact. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=64.0s)]
*  So I stopped the truck almost in the same place I was. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=66.0s)]
*  And I told my colleague, now my son, now I ask God that our time has come. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=73.0s)]
*  Then I said, let's just pray, let's just pray to our Father. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=79.0s)]
*  We started to pray to our Father. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=83.0s)]
*  When we finished praying to our Father, we were over the mud. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=85.0s)]
*  The mud first hit my side, the driver's side, and broke the glass on my side. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=90.0s)]
*  And then it hit the truck's side. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=96.0s)]
*  It hit his side and lifted the truck. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=99.0s)]
*  I think that despite the whole scenario, the whole situation, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=102.0s)]
*  I still managed to have a little bit of calm. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=108.0s)]
*  I tried to escape as much as I could. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=110.0s)]
*  I tried to escape as much as I could. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=114.0s)]
*  In the picture you see the truck going there, going there, going there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=118.0s)]
*  I tried to escape from it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=123.0s)]
*  It was approaching me to one side and approaching me to the other. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=125.0s)]
*  At that moment, the only thing we thought was that we were going to die. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=129.0s)]
*  Because when you see a supernatural force that dragged the truck, dragged the locomotive, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=133.0s)]
*  our truck was like a grain of sand. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=142.0s)]
*  It crushed it very easily. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=146.0s)]
*  So we just asked God to help us out of that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=150.0s)]
*  It's like we see death face to face. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNUzQJCqI0&t=155.0s)]
