Video Description: In Hong Kong’s new “patriots-only” era, anonymous informing is now the norm.
BBC Eye investigates how the rise of “patriots-only” rule in Hong Kong has been marked by arrests of opposition figures, the silencing of critical media, and a growing culture of surveillance and anonymous reporting. Beneath the surface, critics warn the city is drifting toward a climate reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution.
Hongkongers who identify as patriots, including Innes Tang, who talks about how he reported around 100 people to the authorities for suspected national security violations.
Bookstore owner Pong Yat-ming describes how anonymous complaints have triggered repeated government inspections.
Veteran journalist Ronson Chan, arrested while reporting tells how he is now facing trial, and we visit a school promoting “national identity” classes under the new education agenda.

# What does Hong Kong look like under the patriots' rule? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g)
*  Your colleagues are like this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=0.0s)]
*  We don't need to do anything. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=2.0s)]
*  Because we are closed doors. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=4.0s)]
*  It's not like we can rule out that they are not public property. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=6.0s)]
*  When Britain returned Hong Kong to China, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=12.0s)]
*  the territory's freedoms were guaranteed for 50 years. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=15.0s)]
*  But is that promise being kept? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=19.0s)]
*  Before we control the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=23.0s)]
*  we will always control the hands of those who love the country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=27.0s)]
*  This is a guarantee of Hong Kong's long-term security. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=31.0s)]
*  China declared that only patriots can rule Hong Kong. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=37.0s)]
*  Now words can be a crime, and safety is found in silence. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=41.0s)]
*  The number of people arrested by us is close to 100. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=48.0s)]
*  Some have already been sentenced to prison. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=52.0s)]
*  There are quite a few. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=57.0s)]
*  In the scramble to prove loyalty, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=59.0s)]
*  is Hong Kong risking its liberal identity? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=62.0s)]
*  I'm Chan Wong Seng, 43 years old. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=76.0s)]
*  Ronson Chan is an award-winning veteran reporter [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=79.0s)]
*  and former chairman of the Journalists' Union. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=83.0s)]
*  He's an outspoken defender of press freedom. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=86.0s)]
*  Ronson's popularity grew when he live-streamed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=94.0s)]
*  the 2019 pro-democracy protests to millions of viewers. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=97.0s)]
*  We are the People's Liberation Front. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=108.0s)]
*  We are chasing after the water police. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=115.0s)]
*  There's a policeman here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=118.0s)]
*  They are chasing us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=120.0s)]
*  Chicken wings, rice and squid. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=123.0s)]
*  You never thought Hong Kong would be like this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=129.0s)]
*  But it really is. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=132.0s)]
*  In 2020, after a year of demonstrations, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=135.0s)]
*  China acted. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=138.0s)]
*  Bypassing the city's parliament, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=140.0s)]
*  Beijing imposed the National Security Law. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=142.0s)]
*  The law granted sweeping new powers to the police, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=145.0s)]
*  including increased surveillance with severe penalties [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=148.0s)]
*  for vaguely defined offences, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=152.0s)]
*  such as undermining the government [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=154.0s)]
*  or colluding with foreign forces. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=156.0s)]
*  Beijing's move worked. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=165.0s)]
*  Hong Kong went from being one of the most liberal cities in Asia [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=168.0s)]
*  to arresting journalists and academics. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=172.0s)]
*  Hundreds were arrested for speaking up. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=176.0s)]
*  Many of the city's independent news sites [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=182.0s)]
*  were forced to close. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=184.0s)]
*  Ronson live-streamed his home being raided. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=186.0s)]
*  As the police gained more powers, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=190.0s)]
*  a patriot's only rule emerged. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=193.0s)]
*  Only those who swore loyalty to the Chinese [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=196.0s)]
*  could be allowed to enter the country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=199.0s)]
*  The police were forced to close the city [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=202.0s)]
*  because of the police's lack of control. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=205.0s)]
*  The police were forced to close the city [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=208.0s)]
*  because of the police's lack of control. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=211.0s)]
*  The police were forced to close the city [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=214.0s)]
*  Only those who swore loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=217.0s)]
*  could hold positions in government. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=221.0s)]
*  Businessman Innis Tang has long campaigned [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=231.0s)]
*  for closer links with mainland China. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=234.0s)]
*  After the law came into force, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=244.0s)]
*  Tang and his team posted videos [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=246.0s)]
*  each time they reported people to the police. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=249.0s)]
*  They monitored the media for possible cases. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=257.0s)]
*  Tang set up a hotline for the public [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=261.0s)]
*  to report any national security offences. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=264.0s)]
*  Tang says he used his own money to organise rallies [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=291.0s)]
*  in support of the police, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=294.0s)]
*  as they took on the pro-democracy protests. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=296.0s)]
*  There was a Immediately with 단틀 [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=300.0s)]
*  What was the drive for him? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=307.0s)]
*  I am not a political prisoner [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=309.0s)]
*  nor a slave, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=312.0s)]
*  I love my country and I love Hong Kong. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=328.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of change over the last four years. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=335.64s)]
*  My name is Pang Yiming. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=343.48s)]
*  I'm the owner of a boxing gym. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=346.16s)]
*  As a culture of anonymous informing takes hold, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=350.68s)]
*  at least 32 political parties, activist groups and media outlets have shut down. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=354.12s)]
*  Tonight, BookPunch is hosting a talk about the war in Ukraine. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=373.04s)]
*  Mr. BookPunch, I'd like to ask you a question. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=385.12s)]
*  First of all, can you tell us more about your party? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=387.12s)]
*  You didn't take over the public relations? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=389.12s)]
*  Because we've always been like this. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=391.12s)]
*  Our colleagues have always been like this. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=393.12s)]
*  We don't need to... [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=395.12s)]
*  Because we're closed, we're doing private activities. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=397.12s)]
*  So we've always been following your colleagues' instructions to hold events. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=399.12s)]
*  Private activities, registration, public hearing, and closing the door. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=404.12s)]
*  So... [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=409.12s)]
*  It's not like we can rule out that it's not a public event. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=410.12s)]
*  I know. What do you think? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=414.12s)]
*  I'll follow the rules of the party. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=418.12s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=423.12s)]
*  If you think I'm not worthy, I'll make a record. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=425.12s)]
*  But the problem is that we'll need to continue to investigate. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=431.12s)]
*  The officer stayed for 15 minutes and then left. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=437.12s)]
*  The event was allowed to continue. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=441.12s)]
*  He came back two more times that evening and told Pong he might be prosecuted [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=444.12s)]
*  for hosting a public event without an entertainment licence. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=450.12s)]
*  Pong says BookPunch has been inspected as many as 10 times in 15 days [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=456.12s)]
*  by different government departments. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=462.12s)]
*  I can hear you all. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=464.12s)]
*  I can understand the relationship between the 14th and 5th Regulations and Hong Kong. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=465.12s)]
*  Every school now has mandatory lessons designed to build national identity in young people. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=470.12s)]
*  My name is Chan Lui Ling Yee. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=478.12s)]
*  I've been working in education for 50 years. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=482.12s)]
*  Public education and national security cannot be separated. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=487.12s)]
*  Chan Lui Ling Yee helps schools promote a stronger sense of Chinese identity. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=492.12s)]
*  Liberal studies have been replaced by a course on citizenship ideals, lawfulness and patriotism. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=504.12s)]
*  Books which contain so-called bad ideologies are purged from public libraries. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=523.12s)]
*  Some new textbooks falsely state that Hong Kong was never a British colony. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=530.12s)]
*  Visits to mainland China are now mandatory for all high school students. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=544.12s)]
*  The school has changed dramatically in recent years, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=550.12s)]
*  it feels like flowers in a garden. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=555.12s)]
*  When you pick them in early the leavesertain the stinking smell. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=559.12s)]
*  But it Zwijes grows outward it will smell again. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=568.12s)]
*  It smells like that once now. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=574.12s)]
*  Ronson Chan says press freedom in Hong Kong has been decimated. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=580.12s)]
*  Whilst live streaming, Ronson was arrested and charged with obstruction. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=589.92s)]
*  Worrying that the rise of the patriots has gone too far, Chan has stopped reporting suspects. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=610.12s)]
*  When you're unhappy, you can relax. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=640.12s)]
*  Don't think about the difficult things. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=647.12s)]
*  I've been very happy with the way I've played football in the past half year. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=651.12s)]
*  A lot of people have reported me and brought me a lot of trouble. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=659.12s)]
*  It's quite confusing, but there's no way around it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=664.12s)]
*  It's the same thing. I can only walk for a while. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=668.12s)]
*  I can come out and find a place to be a reporter. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=671.12s)]
*  I can just watch football with them. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=676.12s)]
*  An estimated 300,000 Hong Kongers have left the city since the national security law was imposed. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=682.12s)]
*  For many Hong Kongers like Ronson, it is the love for their city that makes them stay. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwuoiG8u54g&t=689.12s)]
