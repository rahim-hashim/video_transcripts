# How will the UK work with Donald Trump? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8)
*  Well, as we said, you know, the eyes of the world are watching what's happening here in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=0.0s)]
*  Washington, including over in the U.K. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=3.68s)]
*  And in the U.K. today, Sir Keir Starmer has been responding to the enormous security failures [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=5.8s)]
*  that led to the Southport knife attack in the summer. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=10.46s)]
*  You will remember it led to several weeks of riding across the U.K. in the summer, prevent [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=13.68s)]
*  that it is the government's anti-excuse me a moment as we're figuring out exactly where [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=18.72s)]
*  we are here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=25.52s)]
*  But indeed, it was the extremist threat that was posed by the attacker Axel Riddikubana. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=26.9s)]
*  And you see here his mugshot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  They missed it, allowing him to knife and murder three young girls in a nursery. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=33.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think what's really interesting about this is that Keir Starmer today has denied [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=37.3s)]
*  any claims of a cover-up, insisting that he knew of this background. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=40.66s)]
*  But he's withheld it from the public, he says, because he didn't want to deny the victims [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=44.62s)]
*  justice at trial. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=51.06s)]
*  Nigel Farage, though, has been telling his side of the story on X saying that he thinks [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=52.7s)]
*  the prime minister wasn't entirely forthcoming on this issue. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=59.46s)]
*  And that's where it gets interesting, because some of the commentary in the newspapers tonight [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  refers to the government's keenness to get their point across before Elon Musk gets distracted [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=67.3s)]
*  on this side and starts tweeting, as he did about the child grooming gang. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=73.06s)]
*  So let's bring in Tom Simons, who's been watching this for us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=76.54s)]
*  Tom, that element is the new reality, really. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=80.94s)]
*  You've got a government in the UK responding to an entirely domestic issue, but trying [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  to get ahead of the story because they're concerned about how it might be portrayed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=89.18s)]
*  from this side. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=93.22s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=94.66000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, Keir Starmer's a former senior prosecutor in the UK back in the day, back [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=95.66000000000001s)]
*  in the 2010s. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=100.66s)]
*  And so what you would have thought would have been an ideal person to deal with, A, these [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=102.34s)]
*  awful grooming gangs, often Asian men in northern cities attacking, grooming, sexually [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=106.98s)]
*  abusing white girls, and B, this horrendous triple knife attack, three young girls murdered [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=112.58s)]
*  in the north west. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=117.94s)]
*  You'd think he'd be on top of all of that as a former prosecutor, but he did struggle [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  with the grooming gangs. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=123.42s)]
*  And it's because Elon Musk took the initiative away from the government, started talking [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=124.42s)]
*  about something that perhaps Keir Starmer felt he had dealt with, as he had, in 2011, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=128.7s)]
*  public opinion followed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  And as you say, I think it is true to say that the government, Starmer, they've got [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=137.38s)]
*  off the blocks very quickly to promise a public inquiry into the Southport murders, the three [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=142.54000000000002s)]
*  girls, and to say that there were already lessons to be learned. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=148.5s)]
*  There's a body that's supposed to pick up when people might be at risk of extremism. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  This guy was not a terrorist. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  He had no political ideology, but he was extremely dangerous. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  And the question is, should that body have picked that up at an earlier stage and prevented [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=163.38s)]
*  those deaths? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=167.62s)]
*  Just more generally, Tom, obviously, Sekeir Starmer and David Lammy are trying to strengthen [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=169.26s)]
*  relations with the Trump administration. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=174.7s)]
*  But there is, most notably, and we saw it yesterday in the Oval Office, a political [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=177.7s)]
*  vibe shift here in so many different areas on green targets, on new rules, on diversity [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=182.04s)]
*  and inclusion, on protection for civil servants, but also on the cultural issues. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=188.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think from London, they're probably looking across at all the razzle [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=193.46s)]
*  dazzle in the US and saying to themselves, we're OK so far. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=197.9s)]
*  Great Britain has not been mentioned. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=202.5s)]
*  The United Kingdom has not been mentioned by Donald Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=204.5s)]
*  The tariffs, well, that's so far Mexico and Canada. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=208.66s)]
*  So I think they'll probably be quite confident at this stage. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=212.36s)]
*  But as you say, it's an enormous challenge. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  I was quite struck with an article that Lord Mandelson, who Britain's picked to be the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=217.7s)]
*  chief diplomat in Washington, wrote on Fox News, of course, very carefully worded. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=223.02s)]
*  He picked up all the major points. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=228.38s)]
*  He called Trump's victory a comprehensive victory. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=230.1s)]
*  He called him a great campaigner. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=233.68s)]
*  He said he was straight talking, deal making instincts. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=235.34s)]
*  He said the US was right to ask NATO for more money. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  And he said that we were old partners offering new ways of working. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  So check, check, check, or tick, tick, tick, as we would say in the UK. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=245.42s)]
*  Every single one of those points hit on the nail. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  And I can say, having heard a speech from the Foreign Secretary David Lammy recently, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=251.14s)]
*  he is saying very similar things. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=255.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=257.82s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  Really interesting to get that perspective. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  And Joel, I know she was scribbling furiously as we were watching that there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=262.7s)]
*  I'm curious, from your post here in Washington, how do you see the reaction that is happening [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=267.14s)]
*  there in the UK? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=272.34s)]
*  I mean, it's quite distressing, quite frankly, as a person who's worked in American foreign [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=273.85999999999996s)]
*  policy for a number of years, for decades, to see countries afraid of the United States [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=279.85999999999996s)]
*  in such a visceral way, to see foreign ministers basically using Trump talking points to gain [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=284.29999999999995s)]
*  favor from him to protect their countries. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=292.02s)]
*  That's not how states are supposed to work with each other. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=295.17999999999995s)]
*  That's not how countries are supposed to work with each other, to work together as equals [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=297.46s)]
*  and deal with hard issues as equals rather than the fear of a close ally. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=300.98s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump is already trying to rhetorically attack our allies. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=305.1s)]
*  Panama, Sweden, Canada. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  Who next? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  I find it very distressing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure what the goal is. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think that when you add to that the social media platforms who are echoing his [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=317.98s)]
*  rhetoric, all the big shots sitting there, the plutocrats at the inauguration, sitting [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=323.06s)]
*  in front of his cabinet choices more important than his own cabinet, that is a very distressing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=329.7s)]
*  signal to send to the world. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  I am the advance envoy for the special relationship. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=337.54s)]
*  I knew there was a reason you were here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=341.02s)]
*  I got here before Lord Mandelstein. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=344.42s)]
*  But there was some reporting this weekend that maybe his papers would be rejected by [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=346.62s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=350.3s)]
*  They're really irritated that Labour sent people over here to campaign for Kamala Harris. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=351.3s)]
*  Can you really imagine that they would say no? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=355.1s)]
*  You know, I think as we move forward, President Trump is going to look at it on a breath stroke. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=357.7s)]
*  But this notion that they're catering to Donald, to President Trump, I don't look at it that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=363.38s)]
*  way. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=369.3s)]
*  They know President Donald Trump. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=370.3s)]
*  They've worked with him for four years. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=371.54s)]
*  He was a president before. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=372.98s)]
*  So this isn't new. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=374.7s)]
*  A new president. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=376.66s)]
*  But Elon Musk's influence perhaps is something new. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=377.66s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=380.18s)]
*  And you know, I saw all those folks who were sitting there and people this morning are [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=381.18s)]
*  all up in arms that you had Metta and you had Elon Musk. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=385.98s)]
*  The last election, they were with Joe Biden. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=390.5s)]
*  So I mean, it's like they're not they're not they're not dumb people here. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=392.74s)]
*  They know exactly what they want. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=397.06s)]
*  So now they're carrying favor. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=398.82s)]
*  They're trying to get in with I don't know about the influence. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=400.26s)]
*  They want to make sure they're at the table. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=403.22s)]
*  They want to make sure that their voice is heard. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=404.88s)]
*  I can guarantee you this. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  President Trump will hear everybody's voices and he's going to make his own decision, his [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=408.86s)]
*  own decision. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=412.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=413.74s)]
*  It's going to be one to watch, isn't it? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=414.82s)]
*  And of course, when Nigel Farage is tweeting, he does look this way for support from some [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=416.42s)]
*  within the Republican movement. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=421.5s)]
*  We'll see how that debate evolves over the next 24, 48 hours. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=422.74s)]
*  We're going to take a short break. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=427.38s)]
*  Do stay with us. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=428.38s)]
*  Plenty more to come on the program. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCS-caNNYr8&t=429.38s)]
