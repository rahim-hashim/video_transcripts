Video Description: Detained Britons Craig and Lindsay Foreman have been charged in Iran with espionage, the country's judiciary news agency has said.
 
Mr and Mrs Foreman were arrested in January but news of their detention, on unspecified security charges, emerged last week.
 
Judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir said that the couple, both aged 52, had "entered Iran under the guise of tourists" and "gathered information in multiple provinces of the country".
 
The couple had been on a motorbike trip around the world and had planned to stay in Iran for five days.
 
The UK Foreign Office's official advice is against all travel to Iran, saying British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at "significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention".
 
Having a British passport or connections to the UK "can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you", it adds.

**BBC - World News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA)
*  The story that the British couple detained in Iran last week have now been charged with espionage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=0.0s)]
*  Craig and Lindsay Foreman were arrested in January in fact but news of their detention only [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=9.44s)]
*  emerged last week when state-run Iranian media reported they were being held on unspecified [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  security charges. The couple both aged 52 had been on a motorbike trip across the world and had planned [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=20.8s)]
*  to be in Iran only for five days. Let's speak to our news correspondent Azadeh Mashiri who's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=27.84s)]
*  following developments from Islamabad. Azadeh what do we know about the decision that's been made by the court? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Well Christian up until now the family did not know what Lindsay and Craig Foreman were accused of and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=43.44s)]
*  it's important to flag that this announcement in some ways of espionage charges wasn't made [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=50.32s)]
*  directly by the judiciary this was from a judiciary run state media news agency. Now [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=57.12s)]
*  Mizan news agency has said that Lindsay and Craig Foreman had allegedly entered under the pretense [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=64.32s)]
*  of tourism but instead had allegedly collected intelligence for western intelligence agencies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=71.12s)]
*  Now this is not at all what has been said by their family it's not at all what was said by Lindsay [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=79.6s)]
*  Foreman's own social media posts because what is really noticeable about this case is that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=86.72s)]
*  Lindsay and Craig Foreman had been documenting their journey in Iran almost every day and what [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=94.16s)]
*  Lindsay Foreman had made very clear in her posts was that as a life coach she was conducting a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=101.28s)]
*  research project across the world about what it meant to live a quote good life and she and Craig [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=106.72s)]
*  Foreman were making this trip on their motorbikes hoping to get to Australia to present that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=113.36s)]
*  research at a conference. Now of course news of their detention only emerged last week when [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=119.12s)]
*  Iranian state media again Iranian state media released that image of the couple meeting the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=125.92s)]
*  British ambassador with their faces blurred in the family then agreed to have them named but again [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=130.8s)]
*  this is of course very distressing for the family that's the word they used when they talked about [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=137.44s)]
*  this situation and they're working with the foreign office and hoping they can get their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=142.64s)]
*  loved ones home safe. The UK travel advisory is pretty specific as a day warns travellers that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  they could be arrested just for having a British passport or connections to the UK were they aware [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  of that warning and have they discussed it? Yes they were and they made that very clear even [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=161.27999999999997s)]
*  before they entered Iran Lindsay Foreman had posted about the fact that they were defying the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=169.04s)]
*  advice of their family friends and the FCDO travel advice which as you mentioned says that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=176.16s)]
*  it does it advises against all travel to Iran for British nationals and if you look at what's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  happened in recent years there have been dozens of arrests of British nationals as well as [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=188.0s)]
*  dual nationals in Iran often under the charges that are vague and security related but what [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=193.84s)]
*  Lindsay Foreman said is that they were facing their fears they hoped that the rewards would speak [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=201.6s)]
*  for themselves and that they believed that there was a shared humanity that they could discover [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=206.96s)]
*  while they were in Iran and if you look at their posts that's often what they're talking about [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=212.56s)]
*  they're talking about tasting the food speaking to people finding that people have more in common [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  than they do apart her last post on social media was her meeting with a cleric in Iran [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=222.56s)]
*  with her hand over her heart speaking about that shared humanity and so to your point though yes [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=229.84s)]
*  they were aware of the risks but they went in anyway. Just very quickly what happens now? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=236.24s)]
*  Well it's unclear all these cases of western nationals who have been detained in Iran can [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=244.8s)]
*  vary and that's one thing we should be really clear of is is that you can't quite group them [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=251.52s)]
*  all together they're always of different circumstances and they really vary in terms [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  of the amount of time that these detainees spend in Iran of course their family has known about [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=260.48s)]
*  this for weeks they're hoping that this ordeal will end quickly there was a case where an Italian [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=266.72s)]
*  journalist last year was released in under a year in only in only a few months but of course then [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  you have other cases for example that of Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe an Iranian dual national British [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=280.48s)]
*  dual national who spent six years in detention in Iran but again it's hard to connect all of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=286.16s)]
*  these cases because of how much secrecy is involved in what goes on in Iran. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av_qhbt30VA&t=292.40000000000003s)]
