*  entail I'm joined by former Rome correspondent and colleague Mark Lowe. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=20.72s)]
*  Mark good to see you. It's taught me first of all through the next couple of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=24.28s)]
*  days because at the moment the body lies in the chapel of the residence of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=27.84s)]
*  Saint Martha. What's happening on Wednesday and then looking ahead what's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=31.64s)]
*  happening over the coming days? So on Wednesday tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=35.28s)]
*  local time the body Pope Francis body and the coffin will be transferred to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=39.24s)]
*  Saint Peter's Basilica there behind us which towers over Saint Peter's Square [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=44.36s)]
*  this gorgeous Renaissance and Baroque Cathedral 15th 16th century with topped [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  by the dome designed by Michelangelo of course and that is where he will lie in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=54.6s)]
*  state between Wednesday and Saturday and we're expecting very large crowds to go [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=58.92s)]
*  in and see his open casket and to pay their final farewell to Pope Francis. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  Then on Saturday morning at 10 a.m. local time the funeral will begin and that will [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=68.88s)]
*  be a funeral that will be that will attract the heads of state and royalty [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=74.68s)]
*  from right across the world. We know already that Donald Trump and his wife [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=79.72s)]
*  Melania will be there the presidents of France and Brazil have confirmed their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=82.92s)]
*  attendance the president of Ukraine is said to be on his way as well to to come [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=86.2s)]
*  to that on Saturday and then after the funeral on Saturday his coffin will be [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=91.2s)]
*  transferred across Rome to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore that is on the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=96.04s)]
*  other side of Rome and that is where Pope Francis said that he wanted to be [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=100.08s)]
*  buried. Now it is rare for Pope's not to be buried at the Vatican it's more than [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  a hundred years since the Pope was not buried at the Vatican and it's very much [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=108.44s)]
*  typical of the kind of more humble quieter end to his life that he wanted. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=111.8s)]
*  Yeah absolutely actually he streamlined the funeral as well hasn't he because [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=116.08s)]
*  in the past Pope's were buried in three different coffins starting with a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=119.28s)]
*  Cyprus coffin but he has wanted to do things differently from the start. He [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=122.84s)]
*  wants to be in a coffin that was wood and zinc and just to be laid in the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=127.52s)]
*  ground simply with his name in Latin Franciscus. This is a man who you know [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=131.44s)]
*  from his humble beginnings then that very much shaped his humility as Pope [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=136.16s)]
*  taking the name Francis after Saint Francis of Assisi shunning the kind of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=141.2s)]
*  ornate clothing for example of his predecessor he didn't like the red [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=146.44s)]
*  paper shoes he wore his slightly scuffed black shoes he lived as you say marry [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=150.76s)]
*  him in the Santa Marta guest house not in the elaborate ornate paper apartments [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=154.56s)]
*  and that will be that will that will shape the end of his life just as it as [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=158.16s)]
*  it shaped his papacy as well. And of course the conclave happens after those [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=162.6s)]
*  nine days of official mourning a very secretive process that I have to say [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=166.68s)]
*  fascinates so many people around the world not least because of the Oscar [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  nominated movie. Yeah indeed which you know I'm sure you and I have seen and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=175.84s)]
*  many others have seen as well and you know having been based here for five [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=179.12s)]
*  years and talking a lot of talking to a lot of people about what how a conclave [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=183.72s)]
*  works I think there's a lot of truth in that in that movie about you know how [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  suddenly all the cardinals are shut inside the Sistine Chapel the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=190.66s)]
*  shutters come down they're cut off in the outside world there are no phones [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=195.72s)]
*  there's no TV there's no connectivity with the outside world there is simply [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=198.72s)]
*  the presence of the Holy Spirit and then they they cast their votes they've got [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=202.56s)]
*  to be under the age of 80 the cardinal electors 138 of them and they will cast [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=207.2s)]
*  their votes on the first day of voting they'll be one vote and then followed by [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=212.56s)]
*  that there'll be two votes in the morning and two in the afternoon [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=215.96s)]
*  initially for a card for a cardinal to get a two-thirds majority to be named [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=218.68s)]
*  Pope if that does not if that after 15 days there's no there's no requisite [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=223.04s)]
*  two-thirds majority it changes to a 50% plus one vote and then after each vote [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=227.84s)]
*  the the ballot papers are burned and if there is no conclusive winner of the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  conclave there is a special chemical put in for the smoke to be black but if if [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=239.6s)]
*  there is a cardinal who emerges victorious to be chosen as the next [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=244.76s)]
*  successor to St Peter at the 267th Pope then a chemical is put in for white [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=248.6s)]
*  smoke to come up from a chimney just across there across St Peter's Square [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  and that is when we are we will be able to see it from here and that is where we [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=257.08s)]
*  are likely to hear the the cheers of there will probably be I mean there will [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=260.64s)]
*  certainly be hundreds of thousands of people from St Peter's Square down the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=264.08s)]
*  road into central Rome and that is when we will know that there is a new Pope [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CXHzFei0E&t=267.12s)]
