# Hamas hands over bodies of four Israeli hostages in Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU)
*  We start in the Middle East where in the past few minutes the bodies of four Israeli hostages [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=0.0s)]
*  have been transferred back to Israel. They include Shiri Bivas and her children Ariel and Kefir. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=4.64s)]
*  Also being returned is the body of Oded Lifshitz, a veteran journalist and peace activist [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=10.88s)]
*  in his mid-80s. The bodies in coffins were handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas in a stage managed [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=15.92s)]
*  ceremony in Khan Yunus a short time ago. Meanwhile Hamas has said it's ready to release all the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=23.2s)]
*  hostages in one go, including those expected to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=29.12s)]
*  The offer, which would involve more than 60 people, is dependent on a full withdrawal of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=35.2s)]
*  Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war. Well these are life [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=39.2s)]
*  pictures now of Khan Yunus which is where the ceremony was held a few moments ago and the crowd [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=45.84s)]
*  starting to disperse there after the Red Cross vehicles set off with the coffins inside them. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=51.36s)]
*  Well let's also have a look at the scene in Tel Aviv which is hostages square which is where [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=59.44s)]
*  the focal point has been for the families of the hostages who are being held in Gaza all this time [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=64.96s)]
*  and for them a grim day as it's the first time during this exchange of hostages [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=70.16s)]
*  that these have been bodies rather than people who are alive coming home. Let's speak to our [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=75.44s)]
*  correspondent Sebastian Asher who's in Jerusalem. So it's a very sombre day for Israel isn't it? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=80.88s)]
*  Yes, I mean some of the previous handovers we've described as being a bittersweet occasion where [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=85.92s)]
*  there's been joy at seeing hostages return, all of them alive until now, but also concern over the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=96.16s)]
*  condition that they've been released in and concern over how they will manage after what they've been [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=102.8s)]
*  through. Today we have seen nothing of that, we've seen caskets containing four of the bodies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=109.84s)]
*  Hamas gave a list of who they were, you said in your introduction there, the Bebas family that's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  a mother Shiri and her two young children. Their faces are on the covers of Israeli newspapers [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=125.04s)]
*  today, one of which the headline reads the pain, the anger and the sorrow and those are the emotions [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  that are certainly being felt in Israel and the fourth as you said was Oded Lifshitz who was a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=137.76s)]
*  peace activist, his wife yesterday on Israeli TV said that she felt that he'd been betrayed by [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  the Palestinians, that he ended up in a coffin after being held hostage in Gaza. The bodies will [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=149.28s)]
*  now be taken by the Red Cross, they'll be handed over to Israel, there'll be a ceremony where a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=157.76s)]
*  military rabbi will conduct prayers over their caskets and then they'll be taken to a hospital [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=162.4s)]
*  in Israel where the job, the task of the forensic identification will begin, that could take many [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=169.12s)]
*  hours and until then the Israeli government isn't formally saying and identifying who the bodies [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=176.96s)]
*  are but as I say across all of the Israeli media, across the world media, those names are there and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=183.84s)]
*  those two young children, those two boys are really and the mother Shiri of course [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=190.72s)]
*  are the two most potent symbols in Israel and for many people across the world both of what happened [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=196.08s)]
*  on October the 7th 2023 in the Hamas led attacks on Israel and since then the ordeal that the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  hostages who were taken around 250 into Gaza, those who've been released, those who remain [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=209.2s)]
*  and those as we're now seeing who died. What's the reaction been if any so far to the way this has [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=216.24s)]
*  been carried out? The Red Cross had hoped for what they described as a dignified handover, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=222.4s)]
*  tell us about a little bit about the way this was handled by Hamas. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=228.24s)]
*  Yes, I mean not only dignified the Red Cross said but private and certainly this wasn't private as [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  we've seen this be this is the seventh such handover now we saw similar choreography as we've seen [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=238.88s)]
*  before we've seen the seried ranks of Hamas fighters and other armed factions lined up, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=245.76s)]
*  we've seen crowds behind them, this is stage in Hanunis in a place of devastation again a platform [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  which a Red Cross representative came up and went through the formalities that Hamas has insisted on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=261.44s)]
*  of signing papers which are then stamped by a Hamas fighter in a mask then the bodies [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=267.44s)]
*  for the first time in coffins were released they were taken by fighters to the white ambulances [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  but were waiting for them very much stage managed again are very much trying to send a message I [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=282.32000000000005s)]
*  think the message this time that Hamas and the other factions are trying to send is to put the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  blame on the Israeli government and specifically on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=292.8s)]
*  there was a black cloth across the main poster that was behind the platform until almost the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=298.24s)]
*  ceremony began if one can call it that it was then it then was pulled away to reveal a caricature of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=306.24s)]
*  Mr Netanyahu with blood and accusing him of being the murderer of these four hostages that clearly [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=315.6s)]
*  is something that will cause greater anger and distaste in Israel than even what we've seen so [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=325.92s)]
*  far in the previous handovers where Israelis were disgusted by what they saw as a propaganda [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=334.24s)]
*  event staged by Hamas now that these are these are coffins and presumably although this still [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=342.8s)]
*  has to be 100% made clear when the forensic identification has taken place of two tiny [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=351.36s)]
*  children will only exacerbate that it is I mean a day of sorrow. Sebastian Asher thank you very [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=358.64s)]
*  much indeed for your analysis there thank you. I want to speak now to Dr H. A. Hellyer senior [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=366.0s)]
*  associate fellow at the security think tank RUCI thanks very much indeed for being with us [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=371.68s)]
*  so fairly grim milestone on this process of exchanging hostages as part of the ceasefire deal [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=376.56s)]
*  what's your reaction to the way this latest one has been carried out? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=383.36s)]
*  Thank you and good morning from having me on your program I don't think it's terribly surprising [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=388.88s)]
*  that Hamas would use this opportunity to to carry out such a spectacle I think what we have to think [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  about at this stage is what this means then for how the Israeli government proceeds on [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=401.76s)]
*  progressing to phase two of the ceasefire as your viewers will know this phase one phase two phase [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=409.2s)]
*  three we're coming to the very end of phase one and phase two is meant to begin fairly soon [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=416.48s)]
*  negotiations should have already begun in earnest they haven't the Israeli government still hasn't [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=424.4s)]
*  sent a negotiation team with a mandate to negotiate for phase two and phase two is really [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=430.48s)]
*  where withdrawal of Israeli military forces on the ground in Gaza are withdrawn and you really get [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=437.6s)]
*  to the stages of ceasefire whereas right now of course these are these are pauses they're [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=446.32s)]
*  intermittent pauses I might say you've had more than 100 people killed in Gaza by Israeli forces [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=452.32s)]
*  just over the past few weeks during the ceasefire so I think we're at a very delicate moment because [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=459.2s)]
*  the ceasefire could indeed fall apart at any time especially in the next week or so especially [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=464.32s)]
*  against the background of talk around removing all Palestinians from Gaza for quote unquote the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=471.52s)]
*  Riviera plan that the Trump administration has put forward and which has been quite enthusiastically [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=480.56s)]
*  accepted by the Israelis so it's a very very difficult time a very difficult moment [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=487.52s)]
*  in order to avoid further bloodshed and suffering yes because we're expecting at the moment six [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=494.8s)]
*  living hostages to be exchanged on on Saturday and does yeah so that's that that would theoretically [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  be the end of phase one is that right? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=507.76s)]
*  Well no because I mean you're you're correct in terms of the the hostages [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=511.44s)]
*  on the Israeli side being released of course there are many being held [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  who are Palestinians in Israeli detention but also the the end of phase one [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=523.76s)]
*  has to begin with the beginning of phase two otherwise phase one just continues but without [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=531.28s)]
*  much happening on the ground in terms of Israeli withdrawal and in order for phase two to take [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=537.68s)]
*  place there needs to be that negotiation process about the details and we just haven't seen that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=544.0s)]
*  really begin at all and again we've seen signs that the Israeli government doesn't want to move [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  to phase two and remember phase two is then followed by phase three and phase three is all [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  about reconstruction of Gaza why would anybody be thinking seriously about reconstruction of Gaza [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=560.8s)]
*  if all Palestinians in Gaza are meant to leave and the Riviera Plan is supposed to come into effect [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=568.4s)]
*  keeping in mind the Riviera Plan is proposed by the American government which is supposed to be [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=575.92s)]
*  immediate and a guarantor of the ceasefire deal and it's already been accepted by the Israeli [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  government which is one side in the ceasefire deal so this is all extremely stabilizing and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=587.2s)]
*  what did you make of we've heard from Hamas in the last day or so that they seem to be saying that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  they would be ready to release all the hostages in one go including those that were expected to be [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=599.5200000000001s)]
*  freed in in phase two but they've said obviously that would be dependent on a full withdrawal of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=604.0s)]
*  Israeli forces from Gaza how how likely a scenario is that I don't think it's likely at all I think [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=608.72s)]
*  that frankly they probably know it's not likely at all because the the Israelis aren't going to [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=615.2s)]
*  commit to a full withdrawal outside of phase two and I'm not convinced that they'll do so even in [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=621.6s)]
*  phase two what we've seen in the Israeli press over the last couple of weeks are indications that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=629.12s)]
*  the Israelis intend to actually prolong phase one but to prolong phase one in a way that combines [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=635.5200000000001s)]
*  elements of phase one and phase two so no withdrawal of Israeli forces on the ground [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=643.6s)]
*  but more and more hostage releases more and more perhaps more releases of Palestinians that are [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=648.88s)]
*  being detained and there are many hundreds of course in Israeli detention facilities and jails [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=658.08s)]
*  but without a withdrawal so in that regard continue phase one or extend phase one but really [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  change phase one so that's no longer phase one but not really going to phase two either at that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=672.08s)]
*  point frankly the ceasefire has fallen apart and we've just come into a new arena where there's [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=676.24s)]
*  there's less of a war on Gaza but there's still there's still hostilities or we could see the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=683.76s)]
*  entire thing fall apart where the Israelis turn around and say no we're going back to war and [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=691.12s)]
*  this has been openly called for by different Israeli politicians including cabinet ministers [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=697.12s)]
*  not just over the past few days but over the entirety of the ceasefire period you had one [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=703.2s)]
*  cabinet minister leave the cabinet saying I'll come back when we go back to war you had one cabinet [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=708.48s)]
*  minister say I'm staying because I know that at the end of phase one we're going to go back to war [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=714.16s)]
*  and the Israeli press has been awash with these sorts of things over over the past month so it's [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=720.4s)]
*  it's a very very difficult moment a very delicate one where we could indeed see the entire thing [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=725.6s)]
*  fall apart. Dr. Ajay Helia thank you very much indeed for sharing your thoughts on the subject thank you. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU38aiy2iU&t=733.84s)]
