# Preserving a dying Singapore tradition - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 09, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY)
*  Making kueh purely by hand is not a profitable trade. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm not the last one to make kueh by hand, but I can say that I'm one of the last few. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=17.88s)]
*  My grandfather started this business from his home kitchen in a village in the 60s. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=25.0s)]
*  They started making local traditional cakes called kueh. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=30.0s)]
*  From there on, my aunt, my parents, my mum started making them as well. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=35.0s)]
*  My favourite kueh is kueh lapis because it's so colourful, it's so chewy, it's soft. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=45.0s)]
*  The way we eat here when I grow up is to peel layer by layer. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=52.0s)]
*  In the market, usually you find nine layers of different colours. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=57.0s)]
*  For us, we make ten layers. So I got one more layer of enjoyment. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=62.0s)]
*  I'm in this because I want to preserve the tradition. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=76.0s)]
*  I want my kids to see how I grew up. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=81.0s)]
*  I'll take over the work after I go to university. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=84.0s)]
*  The day I want to retire, I will leave the decision to my kids whether or not they want to take over the business. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=87.0s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, if they do take over, it's their decision and it's their life. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fjRLkUusNY&t=93.0s)]
