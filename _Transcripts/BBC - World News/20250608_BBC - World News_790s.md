As many as 118 arrests were made in LA this week as a result of ICE operations, including 44 on Friday, sparking two days of protests.

# President Trump orders National Guard to LA after clashes over immigration raids | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24)
*  Hello, I'm Nicky Schellow. Welcome to the programme. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=0.0s)]
*  We start this hour in Los Angeles. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=2.16s)]
*  President Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guards into the city [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=4.36s)]
*  to counter escalating protests in a predominantly Hispanic district [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  of the Californian city. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=13.4s)]
*  It comes after a second day of clashes between residents of Paramount [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  and border immigration officers trying to implement President Trump's policy [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=19.8s)]
*  to deport unauthorised migrants. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=24.64s)]
*  Now, federal ICE agents use tear gas, flashbangs and batons [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=27.2s)]
*  to disperse the protesters. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=31.76s)]
*  The White House border policy chief has gone to Los Angeles [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=33.88s)]
*  to personally supervise the operation, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=37.28s)]
*  during which more than 40 migrants were arrested on Saturday. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=39.72s)]
*  He warned that there would be zero tolerance of any violence [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=43.56s)]
*  or damage to private property. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=46.56s)]
*  The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, said ICE was sowing terror [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=48.96s)]
*  in America's second-largest city. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=53.0s)]
*  Well, announcing the order deploying the National Guard, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=55.64s)]
*  the White House said the administration has a zero-tolerance policy [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=58.96s)]
*  for criminal behaviour and violence, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=62.96s)]
*  especially when that violence is aimed at law enforcement officers [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=65.0s)]
*  trying to do their jobs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=68.64s)]
*  These criminals will be arrested and swiftly brought to justice. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=70.36s)]
*  The commander-in-chief will ensure the laws of the United States [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=74.76s)]
*  are executed fully and completely. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=78.32s)]
*  I want to show you some of the latest pictures from Los Angeles, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=81.64s)]
*  and they come in the last hour. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=85.04s)]
*  They show law enforcement officers wearing protective equipment, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  including helmets, coming out of the Federal Detention Centre. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, several of them fire tear gas towards the protesters. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  And it also appears that some form of explosive stun projectiles, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=101.28s)]
*  which are often described as flashbangs, are thrown. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=106.12s)]
*  Now, this came after the LAPD issued dispersal orders [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=109.68s)]
*  in some parts of the city. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=113.84s)]
*  They had said that the use of less lethal munitions [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  had been authorised, saying they can cause pain and discomfort. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=119.0s)]
*  Well, the protesters then did seem to pull back, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=124.0s)]
*  and then law enforcement officers formed a line, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=127.8s)]
*  and they walked down the centre of the road. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=131.88s)]
*  You can still see those bangs going off, clearing the area. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  They were trying to establish a cordon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=139.88s)]
*  More tear gas and flashbang projectiles were thrown. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=142.88s)]
*  Now, officers say multiple people have been detained [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=146.36s)]
*  for failing to disperse after multiple warnings. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=149.6s)]
*  Well, in the last half an hour, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=153.12s)]
*  President Trump has posted on his Truth Social platform. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=154.72s)]
*  Let me read to you what he said. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=158.44s)]
*  He said, great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=160.68s)]
*  After two days of violence, clashes and unrest, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=164.72s)]
*  we have an incompetent governor and mayor who were, as usual, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=168.24s)]
*  just look at how they handled the fires [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=172.8s)]
*  and now they're very slow permitting disaster. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  Federal permitting is complete, unable to handle the task. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  He goes on to say these radical left protests by instigators [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  and often paid troublemakers will not be tolerated. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=185.8s)]
*  He also says, also from now on, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  masks will not be allowed to be worn at protests. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=192.0s)]
*  What do these people have to hide and why, he says. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  Again, thank you to the National Guard for a job well done. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=199.48s)]
*  We, at the moment, can't yet verify [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=204.04s)]
*  whether the National Guard have actually deployed to LA. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  But earlier, one of the protesters described [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  why they had come out onto the streets. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=213.12s)]
*  Purpose was to peacefully tell them to not take our people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=216.28s)]
*  We overheard, it's been shared, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=220.52s)]
*  that ICE had came to our towns. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=222.52s)]
*  We're just here living, working. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=225.36s)]
*  They stopped at Home Depot where they know [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=227.48s)]
*  that people are undocumented. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=230.04s)]
*  So us, as a community, have came here to try to make peace [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=232.28s)]
*  so that they don't make families separate one another. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=237.0s)]
*  And what did they do? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=240.28s)]
*  They just started to attack us. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=241.12s)]
*  We were peaceful and all of a sudden, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  they started throwing bombs at us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=245.2s)]
*  I know a lot of us just unified together on the other side [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=246.6s)]
*  to not let the bus that was coming in with all the police [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  and instead of them peacefully telling us to back up, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=256.12s)]
*  they just started pepper spraying us. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=259.16s)]
*  There's a lot of women out there that have pepper spray. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, let's put the area where this is happening [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=263.52s)]
*  into a little context for you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=266.0s)]
*  Now, Los Angeles, of course, is a huge sprawling city [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=267.88s)]
*  with many different districts, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=270.6s)]
*  with some of them predominantly populated [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=272.48s)]
*  by particular communities. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=274.52s)]
*  Now, the Paramount District is about 15 miles inland [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  from the Pacific Ocean and its beaches [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=279.52s)]
*  and even further from areas like downtown LA, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=281.72s)]
*  Santa Monica and Beverly Hills. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=285.16s)]
*  It is a predominantly Latino district. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=287.24s)]
*  And despite the name, Hollywood's Paramount Studios [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  are located more than 20 miles away. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=292.56s)]
*  Well, our reporter in Los Angeles is Reagan Morris. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=296.12s)]
*  She brought us this update. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  The area I am, there's a very large law enforcement presence. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=301.36s)]
*  A lot of the protesters have either dispersed [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=305.0s)]
*  or moved on to other areas, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=307.16s)]
*  but we can still hear flash bangs going off in the distance [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=309.6s)]
*  and there were just some fireworks going off. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  One of the neighbors setting them off. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=314.96s)]
*  But it's still quite tense. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  And just about an hour ago, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  we were walking from one area to another [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=320.68s)]
*  and somebody threw a Molotov cocktail [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  over the fence where we were. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  And the LA County Sheriff's came rushing out. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=327.44s)]
*  The guy's leg actually, their pants caught on fire briefly [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=330.4s)]
*  as he tried to stamp it out. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=333.28s)]
*  And they were trying to find out [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  who was throwing Molotov cocktails at them. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=335.4s)]
*  A flash bang accidentally went off next to the police, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=338.4s)]
*  which made a lot of the protesters laugh. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=341.08s)]
*  But then they just came in aggressively [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  and moved people out. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=344.32s)]
*  But we can hear it's still going on and it moves around. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=346.2s)]
*  And we're near an area where earlier today, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  a few hours ago, there was a very large presence [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=352.35999999999996s)]
*  of ICE agents, immigration and customs enforcement, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=355.67999999999995s)]
*  in unmarked cars. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  And we've been told by some locals [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=360.64s)]
*  that there are factories around here [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  where some migrants are still locked inside, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  afraid to come out. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's something we've heard, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  not just over the last few days in LA County, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=369.28s)]
*  but over the last few months [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=371.64s)]
*  that a lot of immigrants who do not have legal documents [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=373.04s)]
*  to live here are living in fear, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=377.04s)]
*  very real fear of being deported. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=379.44s)]
*  Now LA is what's known as a sanctuary city. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=381.36s)]
*  Just explain what that means. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=383.68s)]
*  Well, it's not just LA. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=388.04s)]
*  Most of California is a sanctuary. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=389.44s)]
*  And it means that local law enforcement [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  are not meant to cooperate [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=393.88s)]
*  with federal immigration officials. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=395.72s)]
*  So if an undocumented immigrant, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=397.72s)]
*  illegal immigrant was arrested for shoplifting, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=400.36s)]
*  when they get out of jail, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  the local authorities are not meant to tell [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=405.44s)]
*  immigration and customs enforcement that, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=407.44s)]
*  hey, this guy, you can pick him up and deport him. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=409.2s)]
*  Whereas that would happen in most places in Texas. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=411.68s)]
*  So a lot of lines are being crossed the last few days, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=414.8s)]
*  though, at least the perception of it, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=418.44s)]
*  as people see local law enforcement fanned out [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=420.36s)]
*  on the streets after they were called in to help [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=422.84s)]
*  immigration and customs federal officials to protect them. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=425.96s)]
*  But locally, a lot of people just think [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=429.64s)]
*  they blend it into one and see it as cooperation [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=432.0s)]
*  and targeting the immigrant community. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=434.52s)]
*  How do you think President Trump ordering [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=437.08s)]
*  in the National Guard is likely to go down? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=439.24s)]
*  We've already heard from Governor Newsom [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=441.52s)]
*  saying that it is inflammatory [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=443.56s)]
*  and will only escalate tensions. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  I think that that is what the governor has said. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=450.24s)]
*  And that's what a lot of the local leaders are saying [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=453.12s)]
*  and people we've spoken to here today, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=455.08s)]
*  that that would not be well received in a lot of neighbourhoods, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=457.68s)]
*  especially immigrant... [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=461.48s)]
*  It's where I am in Paramount, it's more than 80% Hispanic. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=462.92s)]
*  It's a very big immigrant community. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=466.92s)]
*  So it will probably not be very well received. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=469.48s)]
*  We've heard from our partners at CBS that, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=471.64000000000004s)]
*  just in the last hour or so, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=474.6s)]
*  that Governor Newsom and President Trump [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=476.48s)]
*  spoke on the phone for about 40 minutes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  We don't know the contents of that phone call, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=480.20000000000005s)]
*  but maybe something has changed throughout that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=482.32s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=485.24s)]
*  And this, of course, is all because of President Trump's policy [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  to deport unauthorised migrants. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=490.2s)]
*  Yes, that is part of the policy, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=495.44s)]
*  whereas California policy is more often to protect migrants, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=497.08s)]
*  whether they have legal documents or not. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=500.72s)]
*  California is the fourth biggest economy in the world. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=503.36s)]
*  And a lot of the agriculture sectors in particular, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=506.56s)]
*  there's a lot of migrants working in those jobs [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=510.64s)]
*  that don't necessarily have legal status in the United States [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=513.04s)]
*  and California and the economy really relies on them. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=515.88s)]
*  So they do try and protect law-abiding migrants [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=518.48s)]
*  without proper paper, many of whom pay taxes [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=522.92s)]
*  and go to work every day. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=525.32s)]
*  Reagan Morris in Los Angeles. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=527.68s)]
*  Well, one witness to the protest that has been going on there [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=529.4s)]
*  over the last few hours spoke to a local reporter [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=534.04s)]
*  at the scene about what they had seen. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=536.48s)]
*  We were at a stoplight on the other side of Paramount, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=539.2s)]
*  Over there in Alondra. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=542.04s)]
*  Went out of nowhere and the stop, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=544.0s)]
*  immigration agents, ICE, all that came, you know, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=547.16s)]
*  they came dressed up in all their military gear [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=550.32s)]
*  and they stopped traffic. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  When they stopped traffic, we started noticing. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=554.16s)]
*  And I told my girl, that's immigration right there. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=556.2s)]
*  What they started doing was they went in front of a business, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=559.64s)]
*  a negocio, and they started raiding it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=563.04s)]
*  They started bringing people out in vans. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=565.2s)]
*  Once they started doing that, that's when everybody knew, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=567.84s)]
*  you know, what was going on. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=571.36s)]
*  And everybody was there in the traffic jam, everybody, right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=572.88s)]
*  You're stuck in your car and your vehicle. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  When they saw us looking at them doing all that, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=578.48s)]
*  that's when they started throwing tear gas. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=580.9200000000001s)]
*  Everybody was still in their vehicles. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=582.72s)]
*  As soon as one of the tear... [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=585.0s)]
*  You said there was, who was behind you? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=590.0400000000001s)]
*  Behind us, there was a woman and her young daughter. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  She was around 13. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=596.44s)]
*  I kept in touch with them and as we speak, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=598.08s)]
*  she's in the hospital [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=600.52s)]
*  because the tear gas bomb hit her right in the face. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=601.76s)]
*  They were right behind us, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=604.24s)]
*  taking notice that we're not there to protest. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=606.36s)]
*  We were stuck at the light, right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=609.28s)]
*  But we're witnessing everything happening [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=611.12s)]
*  right in front of our eyes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=612.56s)]
*  The tear gas explodes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=614.56s)]
*  They come out crying out of their vehicle [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=616.2s)]
*  and they can't breathe. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  They're literally on the ground, right? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=619.88s)]
*  I have the video, I have the footage, right? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  And so what do you and your girlfriend do at that point? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=623.4s)]
*  We get off and we see everybody else getting off to record. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=625.56s)]
*  Peacefully, we do not throw anything at them. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=629.28s)]
*  We're not yelling at them. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=631.48s)]
*  We're just recording what's going on [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=633.12s)]
*  because people deserve to know the truth. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=634.52s)]
*  This is why you guys are here. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=636.8000000000001s)]
*  This is because, you know, these things need to be documented. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  This is what they wanted. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=641.76s)]
*  They wanted people to riot. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=642.64s)]
*  They wanted people to start fireworks. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=644.0s)]
*  They wanted people to start burning out. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=645.48s)]
*  Why? Because this is the effect. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=647.64s)]
*  So they can make us look bad. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  So they can make us seem that we're the ones causing this, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  that we started it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=652.72s)]
*  As Fernando Delgado, a witness to the protest, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  well, Rachel Uranga is the immigration reporter [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=657.9200000000001s)]
*  at the LA Times. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=660.64s)]
*  She told us about the latest situation in Los Angeles. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=661.92s)]
*  Less than an hour ago, I can still hear some of the shots [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=667.16s)]
*  that were running, ringing out in downtown Los Angeles. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=670.92s)]
*  There is some clashes going on in Paramount, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=674.56s)]
*  which is the largely Hispanic community, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=677.36s)]
*  working class Latino community in Los Angeles. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=680.28s)]
*  And there's also another small confrontation [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=684.6s)]
*  in downtown Los Angeles, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  just outside of the Federal Detention Center, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=692.16s)]
*  where immigrants who have been picked up in raids this week [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=694.76s)]
*  or at courthouses are being held. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=699.2s)]
*  Los Angeles is a notoriously blue area, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  and it has a really heavy immigrant population. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=705.76s)]
*  While there's people here that do think that [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=709.5600000000001s)]
*  if you've overstayed your visa, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=713.6s)]
*  or if you aren't here legally, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=717.0s)]
*  you should face the law. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=719.0400000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people out here [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=723.24s)]
*  who support the immigrant community and who are tied to it. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=724.72s)]
*  And just to tell you how deeply embedded [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=728.2s)]
*  California is with this community, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=732.0400000000001s)]
*  it's like one out of every two children are immigrants. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=734.12s)]
*  It's a really high number that live in mixed families. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=737.36s)]
*  One of the family members has a status [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=744.36s)]
*  that they're not here legally. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=746.84s)]
*  Los Angeles has turned into ground zero [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=748.28s)]
*  as a test for the limits of Trump's immigration policy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=751.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, here, this economy really depends [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=756.04s)]
*  on immigrant labor and on communities [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=758.92s)]
*  that are tied to immigrants. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, the Trump administration [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=764.16s)]
*  has really had some high profile rates here, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1_FC6cj24&t=768.16s)]
