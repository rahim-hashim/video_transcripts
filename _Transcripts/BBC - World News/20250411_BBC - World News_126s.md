# Ousted South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol leaves official residence | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q)
*  South Korea's ousted President Yun Sung-nyul waved at supporters as he left the presidential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=0.0s)]
*  complex for the final time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=5.8s)]
*  Last week, the Constitutional Court upheld Mr. Yun's impeachment over his short-lived [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=8.8s)]
*  declaration of martial law in December. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=13.8s)]
*  The former president and his wife have returned to their apartment in the south of Seoul. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=16.52s)]
*  Our Seoul correspondent, Jean Mackenzie, gave us this update. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=22.44s)]
*  Now, this presidential complex has had dramatic scenes, but really today nothing compared [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=26.880000000000003s)]
*  to what we have witnessed there over the past few months. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=33.0s)]
*  This is where we have seen these huge standoffs between Mr. Yun's presidential security team, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=35.6s)]
*  who are protecting him, and the police who are trying to arrest him, as Mr. Yun actually [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  barricaded himself inside this compound at times to try to resist arrest. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=44.72s)]
*  So, today has been a much more peaceful picture. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=49.0s)]
*  Mr. Yun has accepted the decision of the Constitutional Court that we got here in Seoul last Friday [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=52.4s)]
*  to remove him from office. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=57.52s)]
*  And as I said, he's moving back into his old apartment. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=59.36s)]
*  He's going there with his wife and his 11 pets, so that is his six dogs and his five [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=61.6s)]
*  cats. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=66.64s)]
*  But he is still entitled to presidential security, so he will have a number of bodyguards looking [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=67.64s)]
*  after him there as well. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  And he is going to remain in the spotlight for a little bit longer, because on Monday [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=72.92s)]
*  his criminal trial is getting under way. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  He has been charged with insurrection because of his attempts to stage this military takeover [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=78.76s)]
*  back in December. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=84.2s)]
*  And this is one of the most serious crimes that you can be charged with here in South [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  Korea. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=89.4s)]
*  So, if he's found guilty, he is either going to be sentenced to life in prison or the death [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=90.4s)]
*  penalty. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  And as you said, this has been an enormously tumultuous time here in South Korea, which [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  is now only just beginning to look forward. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=99.78s)]
*  So, there is a general election, an election, a presidential election plan for two months' [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=102.28s)]
*  time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=106.44s)]
*  We are waiting to see candidates come forward and we are expecting this to be an incredibly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=107.48s)]
*  polarising and tumultuous time for South Korea, because this period in general has really [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  polarised the country. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=117.06s)]
*  And that was the BBC's Gina McKenzie there in Seoul. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tdUGgTzT9Q&t=122.56s)]
