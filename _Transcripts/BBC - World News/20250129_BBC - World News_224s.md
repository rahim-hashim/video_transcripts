*  At least 30 people have been killed and 60 injured in a crush at the Khumaila festival in northern India. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=0.0s)]
*  Witnesses describe chaotic scenes as people tried to escape the crush with belongings scattered on the ground. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=7.0s)]
*  The Khumaila is one of the world's biggest religious festivals [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=12.8s)]
*  and up to 100 million people are there today to take part in a bathing ritual in the Ganges. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=15.92s)]
*  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has offered his condolences. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=21.12s)]
*  Well, reporters have been talking to some of the people who were caught up in the crush [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=26.2s)]
*  and a warning you may find some of what they say distressing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=29.8s)]
*  There was a huge crowd gathered for bathing when suddenly people started climbing over each other, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=36.8s)]
*  leading to pushing and shoving. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=41.8s)]
*  There was a massive crowd coming from both sides, those going for the ritual bath and those returning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=46.2s)]
*  I was sitting near a barricade and in the midst of the pushing and shoving, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  the entire crowd fell upon me, trampling me as it moved forward. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=57.0s)]
*  When the crowd surged, elderly people and women were crushed and no one came forward to help. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  We were sleeping at the stampede site around midnight when the police came and beat us with sticks, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=71.0s)]
*  telling us to go and bathe immediately. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=76.0s)]
*  Just then, a large crowd surged forward, pushing and trampling us, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=79.0s)]
*  and in that chaos, my sister-in-law lost her life. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=83.0s)]
*  Our South Asia correspondent, Samira Hussain, reports from Prayagraj, where the Holi festival is taking place. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=87.0s)]
*  It was a race from the very beginning. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=96.0s)]
*  Half one in the morning, tension was already building. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=99.6s)]
*  Indian police forces, breaking through their own barriers, sprinting to disperse the crowds. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=104.0s)]
*  Faith is what drove all these people here, wanting to bathe in the holy waters to wash away their sins. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=115.0s)]
*  Instead, many were whisked away, injured or worse. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=125.0s)]
*  I see shoes, I see blankets, empty water bottles, backpacks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=134.0s)]
*  What witnesses have told us is that there were just hundreds and hundreds of people sleeping here on the river banks. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=140.0s)]
*  Just over this way is the main bathing area where everyone wants to take a dip in the holy waters. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=148.0s)]
*  And there was such a crush of people that they came over this way [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=155.0s)]
*  and as ever in this kind of a crowd, one person gets pushed and it ended up that people got trampled on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=160.0s)]
*  One eyewitness said a surge of people came from behind. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=170.0s)]
*  There was nothing the people in front could have done. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=174.0s)]
*  No one followed any rules. The police came, but it was too late. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=182.0s)]
*  Bereft with grief, these people have all lost someone in the crush. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=191.0s)]
*  This woman says her mother fell as the crowds began pushing. That was the last time she saw her. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=199.0s)]
*  I fell in the crush of people, says this woman. After that, I couldn't find my husband. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=209.0s)]
*  A festival to celebrate faith has instead left many grieving. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqecCizU3ME&t=214.0s)]
