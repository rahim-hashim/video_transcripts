The American Airlines flight was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members when it collided with a Black Hawk helicopter as it approached Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
 
Officials have said that the focus has switched to recovery as 27 bodies were recovered from the plane, and one from the helicopter, which had three soldiers on board.

**BBC - World News:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k)
*  I speak for all of us when I say, and certainly all Washingtonians, how very sad we are for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=0.0s)]
*  American Airlines, for the United States Department of Defense, and for all Americans for the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=9.92s)]
*  loss of life that happened with the collision of these aircrafts. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=17.32s)]
*  We know that includes families from across our region as well as in Kansas and across [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=22.52s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=28.88s)]
*  This morning we all share in a profound sense of grief. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=30.44s)]
*  I do want to thank the first responders who acted quickly last night, who ran towards [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=34.24s)]
*  danger, went into a very frigid river, and have worked throughout the night. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=40.2s)]
*  Chief Donnelly reported in last night's briefing that we have a strong mutual aid agreement [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=47.6s)]
*  in our region and those teams have worked together throughout the night in really tough [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=53.800000000000004s)]
*  and heartbreaking conditions. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=59.08s)]
*  We should all thank them for their heroic efforts. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=61.36s)]
*  So we'll have several updates today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=64.36s)]
*  I'm first going to turn to the Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, and then you will [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=66.48s)]
*  hear directly from Chief John Donnelly with a situational update. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=74.04s)]
*  Thank you, Mayor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=79.52s)]
*  Again, Sean Duffy here, Secretary of Transportation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=82.8s)]
*  We wish we were gathering for different purposes today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=86.32s)]
*  I just want to let you know that the Department of Transportation, the FAA, along with the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=90.72s)]
*  White House President Trump, local, state, and federal partners, all working together [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=96.24s)]
*  on this incident in unison. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  I couldn't be prouder of this team that's been assembled, working tirelessly. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=105.72s)]
*  Mayor, I want to thank you specifically for your work. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=109.32s)]
*  A few details I'd like to give all of you, and some of you have reported this, but last [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=112.32s)]
*  night, if you live in the D.C. area, you would know that this was a clear night last night. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=117.8s)]
*  The helicopter was in a standard pattern. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=125.08s)]
*  If you live in the D.C. area, you'll see helicopters up and down the river. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  This flight pattern is seen oftentimes when you live in D.C. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=131.72s)]
*  This was a standard flight pattern last night as well. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=135.2s)]
*  The American airline flight coming into land was in a standard flight pattern as it was [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=138.44s)]
*  coming into D.C.A. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=144.26s)]
*  So this was not unusual with military aircraft flying the river and aircraft landing at D.C.A. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  And again, if you live in the area, you'll see that frequently with those two aircraft [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=154.48s)]
*  working together. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=163.36s)]
*  As many of you have reported, we have located the two aircrafts. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=168.36s)]
*  The fuselage of the American airline plane was inverted. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=174.72s)]
*  It's been located in three different sections. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=180.16s)]
*  It's in about waist-deep water. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=184.24s)]
*  So that recovery is going to go on today as that recovery takes place of the fuselage [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=186.64s)]
*  of the aircraft. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  NTSB is going to start to analyze that aircraft, partner with the FAA with all the information [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=193.84s)]
*  we have to get the best results possible for the American people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  I would just say that safety is our expectation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=204.92s)]
*  Everyone who flies in American skies expects that we fly safely, that when you depart an [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  airport you get to your destination. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=216.88s)]
*  That didn't happen last night. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=220.42s)]
*  And I know that President Trump, his administration, the FAA, the DOT, we will not rest until we [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=222.33999999999997s)]
*  have answers for the families and for the flying public. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  You should be assured that when you fly, you're safe. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  Is that yours? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Secretary. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mayor. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=246.89999999999998s)]
*  I'm here today with Fire Chief Bonnet from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=247.9s)]

*  Last night at 848, the control tower sounded an alert which alerts responders to respond [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=258.82s)]
*  to a report of an aircraft crash on or near the airport. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=265.82s)]

*  Very quickly this call escalated. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=284.02s)]

*  escalated to a response that ultimately included about 300 people last night. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=294.14s)]

*  this early stage. American Eagle Flight 5342 operated by PSA Airlines traveling from Wichita, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=482.76s)]
*  Kansas to Reagan National Airport was involved in an accident just before 9 p.m. local time [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=490.76s)]
*  on final approach into Reagan National. It collided with a military aircraft on an otherwise [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=500.36s)]
*  normal approach, and at this time we don't know why the military aircraft came into the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=507.36s)]
*  path of the PSA aircraft. Flight 5342, a CRJ-700, was under the command of four crew members. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=513.6s)]
*  They carried 60 passengers, as you know, for a total of 64 people on board. In addition [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=523.24s)]
*  to local resources already here in DC, American Airlines has activated our care team, and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=528.32s)]

*  They've been working through the night with courageous efforts. We're actively working [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=566.54s)]
*  with local, state, and federal authorities on emergency response efforts and closely [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=572.54s)]
*  coordinating with PSA Airlines as they cooperate fully with the NTSB on the investigation. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=577.4s)]
*  I know that there are many questions at this early stage. I just won't be able to answer [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=585.5799999999999s)]
*  many, but we'll provide additional information as it comes. Thank you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=590.82s)]
*  I want to introduce the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority CEO Jack Prater. The authority [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=599.94s)]

*  for all the victims of this flight and for their families. There's a lot of grieving [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=619.54s)]
*  going on, and so we're very sympathetic to that. I want to echo what was said about the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=623.78s)]
*  first responders. When there's a problem in this area, everybody drops everything, and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=629.54s)]
*  they rush to where the problem is. So I want to thank the Chief, the entire team from Washington, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=634.78s)]
*  DC, but just as important, the list of folks that the Chief described, the federal authorities [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=641.78s)]
*  have been here en masse, and so a lot of effort was brought to bear. Unfortunately, we weren't [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=648.12s)]
*  able to rescue anyone, but we are in the recovery mode right now. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=655.5600000000001s)]
*  And I just want to, you know, last night I expressed the fact that we hope to open at [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=661.12s)]
*  11 o'clock today, and that is still the case. We're going to open the airport at 11 o'clock. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=666.54s)]
*  And again, condolences to the families and thanks to the many, many who are still out [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  there working very, very hard to complete this recovery. Thank you, Mayor. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=680.28s)]
*  I do want to acknowledge that the Virginia Transportation Secretary is here in addition [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=688.04s)]
*  to the Alexandria mayor, and I would like to ask members of the Virginia Congressional [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=695.64s)]
*  delegation to the podium next, U.S. Senator Mark Warner, followed by Tim Kaine and Representative [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=703.92s)]
*  Don Beyer. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=710.56s)]
*  Thank you, Mayor. I want to join with everyone else and express my condolences for the victims. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=714.3199999999999s)]
*  For folks who don't live in the DMV, we are made up of a lot of jurisdictions – Reagan [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=719.96s)]
*  Airports in Virginia. Across the river we have Maryland, obviously the district, but [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=728.76s)]
*  has been indicated by the chief. When tragedy happens, all those distinctions between the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  various jurisdictions and our federal partners all disappear. And I want to again thank all [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=743.0s)]
*  the first responders. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=749.12s)]
*  On a personal note, I'll just add that literally I now know I was coming back from the district [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=751.04s)]
*  from a dinner to my home in Old Town Alexandria. And while I did not see the collision, I wondered [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=759.04s)]
*  – I'd never seen this many red lights streaming towards the airport and across the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=769.04s)]
*  river in Maryland about this time. My phone started blowing up and I realized that this [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=774.36s)]
*  accident had taken place. There'll be a time to figure it out. I know NTSB will have [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=779.32s)]
*  a briefing later in the day. But to the victims, our condolences to the first responders, our [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=783.52s)]
*  thanks. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=791.24s)]
*  Sorrow, thanks, and questions. So sorrow, as all have expressed to the crew, to the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=793.96s)]
*  passengers, to the soldiers, to their families, to their friends, to their loved ones, to [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=801.96s)]
*  people who are still trying to get information and unsure whether their loved ones have been [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=806.96s)]
*  lost, we offer our profound condolences to them and our sorrow for this tragedy. Thanks. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=812.96s)]
*  I'll echo, Mayor, what you began with when you see a challenge like this and you see [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=819.96s)]
*  people from so many different agencies, local, state, federal, with different uniforms, different [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=825.96s)]
*  badges, but working in such a coordinated way. Even in the midst of a tragedy, it does [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=830.96s)]
*  give you a sense of appreciation and pride in people's willingness to come to the danger [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=835.96s)]
*  and work together. And I started to see that as a local official 30 years ago in Richmond [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=841.96s)]
*  and definitely have seen it here. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=846.96s)]
*  And then finally, questions. There are going to be a lot of questions, obviously, a lot [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=849.96s)]
*  of questions. And that's what the NTSB's job is, is to be an independent investigator [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=852.96s)]
*  of incidents like this. And they are here. We were in dialogue with them earlier today. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=858.96s)]
*  They've been here since they got the alert. And they will be doing the work and playing [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=863.96s)]
*  lead in answering the many questions that we have. And that's as it should be. It's [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=867.96s)]
*  not a time to speculate. It's a time to investigate and get answers to the questions we need. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=871.96s)]
*  And I have confidence that will be done. Thank you. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=876.96s)]
*  Follow-up on the Senate. I think grief, thanks, and service with millions and millions of [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=879.96s)]
*  Americans traveling every year. We are all grieving knowing that it could have been our [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=889.96s)]
*  loved ones, it could have been us, and our hearts go out to all those who have lost folks. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=895.96s)]
*  In a most partisan place also, I'm really thankful that Democrats and Republicans, people [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=901.96s)]
*  from all over have come together to try to make sure that people are served. As a local [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=906.96s)]
*  representative, I want the families to know that our office is available to serve you [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=912.96s)]
*  in any way we possibly can through this time of grief and transition and loss. And then [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=917.96s)]
*  also just note that we're deeply grateful for the people who risked their lives last [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=923.96s)]
*  night on a moment's notice, and spent the whole night on the river, and the ice and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=929.96s)]
*  the wind serving us. And then finally, as Senator Kaine noted, after the NTSB investigation, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=933.96s)]
*  we've got to make sure that at the federal level and with the support of Virginia, Maryland, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=943.96s)]
*  D.C., we're doing everything we can to make sure this does not happen again. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=948.96s)]
*  So with that, it's been said already that the National Transportation Safety Board [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=952.96s)]
*  becomes the lead agency in the investigation. Our jurisdiction in D.C., where the crash [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=956.96s)]
*  occurred over the river, concludes as we continue to work with the state to make sure that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=964.96s)]
*  the people who are in the water are safe and sound. And then finally, as Senator Kaine [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=970.96s)]
*  noted, the National Transportation Safety Board over the river is, concludes as we, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=976.96s)]
*  in the leadership role of the unified command, as we shift to a recovery effort, we expect [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=982.96s)]
*  the National Transportation Safety Board to provide briefings to the press later in the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=988.96s)]
*  day. So at this point, we can take a few questions. Yes? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=994.96s)]
*  Yes? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1000.96s)]
*  What we're talking, what we can talk about today is what happened here with the collision [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1006.96s)]
*  of these vehicles. We said what we know and that the National Transportation Safety Board [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1012.96s)]
*  continues to investigate. I don't know that any of us have been briefed on anything that [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1018.96s)]
*  would suggest any other aircraft are implicated. Yes? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1024.96s)]
*  Chief? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1030.96s)]
*  So the rescue operation, or the recovery operation goes on. It's a lot of touch and [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1034.96s)]
*  feel in the different parts of the plane or in the helicopter. And the crash area is a [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1040.96s)]
*  little spread out, so we've got some work to do. And I think it's a pretty normal type of [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1046.96s)]
*  situation. I don't think it's extraordinary. How spread out is this debris field? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1052.96s)]
*  So the wind started blowing last night, so we've had debris travel from the airport down as far as the Wilson [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1058.96s)]
*  Bridge. Mile-wise, how far is that? I couldn't tell you. Less than a mile. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1064.96s)]
*  This is a question for CEO Carter. You're going to open the airport at 11 o'clock this morning. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1070.96s)]
*  How are you going to do that? And what impact does that have on operations, on passengers, on people's [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1078.96s)]
*  anxiety? How are we going to do that? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1084.96s)]
*  Well, we're going to open the airport at 11 o'clock. It's safe. We've worked with all the federal agencies, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1088.96s)]
*  FAA, and it's been determined that we can open that airport safely. The recovery effort that's on our [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1094.96s)]
*  company is on the waterfront. Our primary runway, 119, will be open. It's away from any activity. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1102.96s)]
*  We're going to have a secure area around that, so all are comfortable that we can get back to operations. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1110.96s)]
*  Now, each airline will announce or communicate to their passengers what their operations are going to be. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1118.96s)]
*  Obviously, their networks were disrupted overnight, and so we might have a slow recovery, but the bottom line is [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1126.96s)]
*  we will begin to have aircraft moving out of this airport at 11 o'clock. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1132.96s)]
*  Okay, so one, two, three. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1138.96s)]
*  I don't think we can say anything about what's in TSB's purview. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1144.96s)]
*  You mentioned the airport opens three hours from now. There's a lot of helicopter traffic from the military. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1150.96s)]
*  Will helicopters be flying right through here as well beyond the recovery efforts? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1156.96s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that, Jack. Do you have anything to add? We don't have anything to add about that. Yes? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1162.96s)]
*  For a second, can you read your announcement that the U.S. still has the safest airspace in the world? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1168.96s)]
*  So the question is, can I guarantee the American flying public that the United States has the most safe and secure airspace in the world? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1176.96s)]
*  And the answer to that is absolutely yes, we do. We have early indicators of what happened here, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1184.96s)]
*  and I will tell you with complete confidence we have the safest airspace in the world. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1190.96s)]
*  What about the flight manifesto? Is there any due notice to fly on that flight? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1196.96s)]
*  Can you add anything? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1202.96s)]
*  All I can say is that we have published the 1-800 number. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1208.96s)]
*  We have family assistance centers set up here in the United States. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1214.96s)]
*  We have over 100 team members that are either here or on their way that are specially trained to work with family members, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1220.96s)]
*  handle travel arrangements, and we have a number of other teams that are here to help with that. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1226.96s)]
*  We have a number of other teams that are here to help with that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1232.96s)]
*  We have a number of other teams that are here to help with that. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1238.96s)]
*  We have a number of other teams that are here to help with that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1244.96s)]
*  We have a number of other teams that are here to help with that. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1250.96s)]
*  We have a number of other teams that are here to help with that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1256.96s)]
*  We have a number of other teams that are here to help with that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1262.96s)]
*  Chief Donnelly, can I ask you to describe the next phase of the investigation? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1268.96s)]
*  How confident are you that you will be able to recover all 67 of these bodies? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1274.96s)]
*  Can you speak to some of the debris that's also coming from the cold out of the river? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1280.96s)]
*  We understand there are two cases, some other things that have been pulled out from the river. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1286.96s)]
*  I think the next phase of this operation is going to be led by the NTSB. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1292.96s)]
*  I think the next phase of this operation is going to be led by the NTSB. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1298.96s)]
*  All of us are working together though to search the area and find the victims. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1304.96s)]
*  I'm confident that we will do that, and that will take us a little bit of time though. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1310.96s)]
*  It may involve some more equipment. As far as the things being collected, I don't have personal knowledge. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1316.96s)]
*  I know that we have been collecting debris that you would expect to see from a plane. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1320.96s)]
*  Anything about the victims? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1326.96s)]
*  So the question is about the victims. The NTSB is going to lead that portion of the contact with the victims. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1330.96s)]
*  I believe American is going to be involved with that as well, and so will the FAA and the Department of Transportation. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1338.96s)]
*  We're going to take some questions over here. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1344.96s)]
*  One, two, three, four. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1348.96s)]
*  For Secretary Duffy, the flight path that the helicopter was on, is that a common flight path and is it normal for helicopters to get clearance to cut across busy flight paths? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1352.96s)]
*  I don't know if you all could hear the question. It's a question about the flight path of the helicopter. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1362.96s)]
*  I don't want to go into too much detail about the information we have from the FAA, but obviously it is not standard to have aircraft collide. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1370.96s)]
*  I want to be clear on that. But prior to the collision, the flight paths that were being flown from the military and from American, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1380.96s)]
*  that was not unusual for what happens in the D.C. airspace. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1390.96s)]
*  And as this investigation moves forward, we will be able to provide more information to you about the details of that statement. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1395.96s)]
*  I wanted to follow up on that question regarding the flight path. You said it's standard. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1404.96s)]
*  So do you speak to the conversations of aircraft control? Were there blind spots here? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1409.96s)]
*  So the question is, were there blind spots with air traffic control? I don't want to make statements about that. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1415.96s)]
*  I don't need that answer. But again, I think whether it was air traffic control, whether it was military aircraft, helicopters, or the American flight, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1423.96s)]
*  everything was standard in the lead up to the crash. Now obviously there was something happened here. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1436.96s)]
*  You'll get more information and more details as this investigation moves forward. We'll learn what happened. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1444.96s)]
*  But again, those who live in the D.C. area, we see military helicopters fly up and down the river. It's a standard path that they fly. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1450.96s)]
*  They're used to aircraft landing at D.C.A. And there's a procedure in place because this happens every day. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1458.96s)]
*  Something went wrong here. I look forward to the time and point when we can give you that information. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1466.96s)]
*  But I don't want to comment on that right now. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1471.96s)]
*  Senator Wayne, Senator Warner, you all have been very vocal about your concerns about busy runway, air traffic. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1474.96s)]
*  I know it's still early in the investigation. I'm just curious, is there any steps that you all plan to take to address that? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1483.96s)]
*  We have raised this issue continuously. We've got very busy airspace. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1489.96s)]
*  For those of you joining us, you are watching BBC News. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1495.96s)]
*  And this is a news conference happening live right now after the incident involving American Airlines plane and a U.S. military helicopter. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1500.96s)]
*  Let's dip back in and have a listen. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1510.96s)]
*  We have faith that the NTSB will provide the answers about this. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1512.96s)]
*  OK, you four here and I'm going to take three in the middle and then we're going to have to wrap one, two, three after this young man. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1515.96s)]
*  Thank you, Chief. I know, I can imagine it must be traumatic for the first responders. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1522.96s)]
*  How are they doing right now and are you all going to be offering services to help them as they process this? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1528.96s)]
*  So thank you for the question. Our first responders are resilient people, but yes, this call will be hard for them. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1535.96s)]
*  Our peer support teams are already engaged with the responders and we'll be following up on that to make sure that they're OK. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1543.96s)]
*  But I think the concern is real. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1550.96s)]
*  What kind of communication was there between the helicopter and the tower, the plane and the tower and the helicopter and the plane? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1552.96s)]
*  I don't want to say too much on the communication between the helicopter and the tower and the airline and the tower. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1563.96s)]
*  But I will say this. There was there was communication. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1571.96s)]
*  It was. I would say standard communication, so there was not a breakdown. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1575.96s)]
*  If that's your question, in communication between the military helicopter and the American airline flight, there was there was communication between the aircraft and the tower. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1582.96s)]
*  Is the plane aware there was a helicopter in the area? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1591.96s)]
*  I would say the helicopter was aware that there was a plane in the area. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1598.96s)]
*  So the president said yes, we will be calling the briefing. Has he returned to the briefing room? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1605.96s)]
*  Has he struggled? Also a question about the national security advisor, Mike Walton, saying that there were 30 bodies that had been recovered. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1611.96s)]
*  You said that in the White House. I'm curious, I know you're in this press right now, so that's hard to read. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1620.96s)]
*  But I do have a question on the policy. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1625.96s)]
*  I can do the body. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1627.96s)]
*  I'll give the body first. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1629.96s)]
*  So in terms of body recovery, we as we recover bodies, we have a process and we're not counting any bodies until they're in the possession of the medical director. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1630.96s)]
*  So there may be some fluctuating in numbers that other people would report, but our numbers from the medical examiner. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1641.96s)]
*  So in regard to the president in the briefing room, I've been with this team for the last hour plus. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1648.96s)]
*  As we've worked through the details of information we wanted to give you. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1656.96s)]
*  But it is my understanding that either this morning he was going to be in the in the situation room or the situation room is obviously briefing the president. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1660.96s)]
*  He has been kept in full appraisal of what is taking place. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1668.96s)]
*  Okay, last to you and you ma'am. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1674.96s)]
*  First. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1677.96s)]
*  On a standard. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1679.96s)]
*  Airport. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1682.96s)]
*  Open. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1683.96s)]
*  Play. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1684.96s)]
*  Like. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1687.96s)]
*  Are they. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1688.96s)]
*  Direct. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1689.96s)]
*  Do you want to. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1694.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1696.96s)]
*  Safety is paramount and I don't have that information quite yet from the FAA. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1699.96s)]
*  So I don't want to provide an information or I don't want to provide an answer or inaccurate information on what routes will be flown out of DCA. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1705.96s)]
*  That's one. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1714.96s)]
*  What do you know about the experience in history of the pilot? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1717.96s)]
*  The airline plane and the army helicopter. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1720.96s)]
*  And then for Secretary Duffy last night, the president had said that this could have been prevented in question why air traffic control didn't tell the helicopter what to do. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1724.96s)]
*  Is that something that investigators have determined should have happened? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1734.96s)]
*  I don't have a lot of information to release, but these are experienced pilots. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1737.96s)]
*  I know that the captain was had six years. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1746.96s)]
*  Here's the PSA and the first officer almost two years. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1749.96s)]
*  And again, standard approach. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1753.96s)]
*  And that's all about all I can say. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1757.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1759.96s)]
*  In regard to the military, I don't have information on what to do. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1761.96s)]
*  In regard to the military, I don't have information in regard to the experience of the military pilots. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1764.96s)]
*  I would just note that this was classified as a training mission. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1770.96s)]
*  Sometimes people could think that a training mission is someone who is inexperienced in the cockpit. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1774.96s)]
*  This is we call these these missions that are flown in the DCA area as our pilots are getting hours and experience training mission. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1781.96s)]
*  So don't read into that that we had how many hours the pilots on the military aircraft had. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1789.96s)]
*  And you had another question for me that was last night. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1796.96s)]
*  This could be prevented. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1799.96s)]
*  And also that aircraft question why they may not have communicated with the helicopter. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1801.96s)]
*  So so we are going to wait for all the information to come in from from this vantage point. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1806.96s)]
*  But to to back up what the president said, what I've seen so far, do I think this was preventable? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1811.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3A1E94b8k&t=1817.96s)]
