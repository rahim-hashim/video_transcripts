Video Description: Six weeks ago, warring parties in Yemen began a ceasefire in the port city of Hudaydah, which is a gateway for supplies - in particular food aid - into the country.
It is one of the areas controlled by Houthi rebels, but since June had been under assault by a Saudi-led coalition backing the pro-government troops.
The desperately fragile, uncertain truce in Hudaydah continues.
But as the BBC's Lyse Doucet reports, it has done nothing so far to ease fears of a famine.

# Where Yemen's war has stopped... for now - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 29, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg)
*  We're traveling now under heavy protection with the Emirati forces to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=0.0s)]
*  Budeda City. We're right to the southeastern edge about one and a half [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=29.88s)]
*  kilometers away from the Houthi positions. There's supposed to be a ceasefire now [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=34.8s)]
*  as we leave we're already getting reports of shooting in Budeda. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=40.0s)]
*  So this is the Red Sea flour mills as you can see completely abandoned. It was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=52.76s)]
*  destroyed in the fighting between the Houthis and Yemeni government and Emirati [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=58.28s)]
*  forces. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=62.92s)]
*  These are the positions where Yemeni government forces and Emirati allies [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=79.84s)]
*  stopped the fighting. The Houthis are less than a mile from here as well as the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=84.88s)]
*  new UN team in the city centre trying to oversee this rare truce. It's regarded as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=90.2s)]
*  the best chance in a long time to bring peace but it's so fragile. So little [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  trust here, so much tension. They keep telling us keep moving moving moving [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=104.8s)]
*  thinking there could be an attack anytime by the Houthis and I'm sure it's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  the same on the other side. This is what a ceasefire so called in Budeda feels [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=114.6s)]
*  like. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=120.76s)]
*  Even with a ceasefire the suffering of civilians in Yemen hasn't stopped and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=139.92s)]
*  yet not a single Yemeni we spoke to said they expect this truce to hold and then [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=152.6s)]
*  the situation in Yemen will become unimaginably worse. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qvGdlx7Bg&t=159.2s)]
