Video Description: Rebels from the Congolese M23 movement say they have entered the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo city of Goma and taken control.
 
Sitting on the border with Rwanda and the shores of Lake Kivu, Goma is a vital trading and transport hub, home to more than a million people and within reach of mining towns supplying metals and minerals in high demand such as gold, tin and coltan.
 
The rebels say they now control the city, but the Congolese government says its troops still hold some key locations.
 
Heavy artillery and gunfire has been heard in the city throughout the day.
 
The M23 are led by ethnic Tutsis, who say they needed to take up arms to protect the rights of the minority group.

# Rebels claim capture of major DR Congo city of Goma | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw)
*  The UN Security Council has condemned what it calls the unauthorised presence of external forces in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=0.0s)]
*  At the council meeting in New York, the United States, France and Britain said Rwandan troops had supported the rapid advance of M23 rebel forces into the centre of Goma. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=9.0s)]
*  The rebels say they now have control of the city and have urged its other 1 million inhabitants to remain calm. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=23.0s)]
*  After several hours of gunfire on Sunday night, the streets are reported to be quiet this morning with no reports of serious bloodshed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, let's bring in our Africa correspondent, Braabra Plet Usher, who's following these events for us from Nairobi. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=39.0s)]
*  Braabra, what more can you tell us about what's been happening in the last 24 hours? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=46.0s)]
*  Well, Sally, the M23 has been advancing on Goma amid intense fighting in the past couple of days, actually. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=53.0s)]
*  And in the past 24 hours, the rebel group says that it has taken control of the city. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=59.0s)]
*  It says that it is currently at the city stadium registering weapons from surrendering Congolese soldiers who had issued an ultimatum for them to disarm by a certain time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=65.0s)]
*  And it says at this point it's doing that and has posted photographs to back up what it's saying. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=77.0s)]
*  We also have a report or notice separately from the Uruguay contingent of the UN Peacekeeping Force saying that indeed some Congolese soldiers have surrendered. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=82.0s)]
*  But at the same time, the Congolese government has issued a statement denying that the M23 controls the city, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=94.0s)]
*  saying that the Congolese government is still in control of the main strategic points, including the airport, and that the M23 is on the outskirts. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=100.0s)]
*  So we don't have full confirmation yet of who exactly is in control, but the M23 is very much in the area. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=108.0s)]
*  And as we have been reporting, the big concern, the most immediate concern, of course, is the fate of civilians because there are about a million people living in the city. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=117.0s)]
*  But then nearly that same number of people who have been displaced by the war in eastern Congo, who were living in very big camps around Goma, and have been on the move since the M23 started to advance. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=125.0s)]
*  And so we have, as you said, not heard any reports of major bloodshed so far, and that is something that is of great concern to all the authorities watching. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=137.0s)]
*  Now Kenya is saying that they're trying to obviously broker some sort of peace in this scenario, that the presence of Rwanda and Congo will meet in the next few days. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=148.0s)]
*  What is the hope that the two could come to some kind of agreement about what's happening there? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=160.0s)]
*  Well, they had failed to come to some kind of agreement in December when they were quite close to reaching one in a process that was mediated by Angola. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=167.0s)]
*  And that broke down because the Rwandans withdrew, saying they couldn't continue because the Congolese government refused to negotiate directly with the M23. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=176.0s)]
*  The Congolese government is convinced that it's Rwanda that's really behind all this. Rwanda backs the M23. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=186.0s)]
*  Kinshasa has accused it of sending forces over the border to help the M23 in its advance, something that Rwanda denies. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=192.0s)]
*  Now that particular version of events is supported by many Western countries, by the UN. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=200.0s)]
*  The UN secretary general has called on Rwanda to withdraw its forces. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=207.0s)]
*  The Security Council didn't name Rwanda, but said external forces should pull back. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=211.0s)]
*  And a UN report issued in the last year or so basically said there were 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers in the Congo, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=216.0s)]
*  and that one of the reasons they were supporting M23 was because they were helping to get minerals from Congo, which they then re-exported. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=224.0s)]
*  So that's the context. The Rwandans say, no, none of that is true. They placed this in the context of the 1994 genocide. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=231.0s)]
*  The UN has warned of a wider regional war, and many people are saying this is something that cannot be settled militarily. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=239.0s)]
*  It is a political conflict, and it needs some kind of political support. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=244.0s)]
*  So the UN has been very clear about this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=249.0s)]
*  The UN has been very clear about this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=252.0s)]
*  The UN has been very clear about this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=254.0s)]
*  The UN has been very clear about this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=256.0s)]
*  The UN has been very clear about this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=258.0s)]
*  The UN has been very clear about this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=260.0s)]
*  The UN has been very clear about this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=262.0s)]
*  So the Kenyans say that both leaders, the leaders of Rwanda and the DRC, are willing to come to this summit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=264.0s)]
*  So we'll see whether this latest military advance will have made any difference in terms of reaching a resolution. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=271.0s)]
*  Okay. For now, thank you very much, Barbara Plett-Ursa there in Nairobi for us. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkg8ZRJCwgw&t=278.0s)]
