Video Description: A Kenyan member of parliament has been shot dead in the streets of the capital Nairobi by gunmen on a motorcycle in a suspected assassination.
Police said the attackers had been trailing Charles Ong'ondo Were's vehicle before one of them got off the motorbike and shot him at close range.
"The nature of this crime appears to be both targeted and predetermined," police spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga said in a statement.
The opposition MP had two months ago complained about threats to his life, local media reported.

# Kenyan MP shot dead in ‘targeted’ attack in Nairobi | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg)
*  There's been a horrified reaction in Kenya to the gunning down of a member of parliament [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=0.0s)]
*  on one of Nairobi's main roads. Charles N'ongo-Wehre was ambushed on Wednesday by gunmen on a motorcycle. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=5.44s)]
*  Police say the killing was targeted. Well, let's go live now to Nairobi and to Anne Soy, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=13.44s)]
*  our BBC Deputy Africa editor. Anne, thank you very much for joining us. This was obviously [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  an extremely shocking and daring attack given that it happened in daylight in Kenya's capital. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=26.72s)]
*  That's right. It happened at a busy roundabout that is usually manned by police. There is CCTV [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=35.68s)]
*  there, which the police have access to. And we understand that he was shot at at close range. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Police have said that it appears predetermined, premeditated. And there were two people on a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=50.48s)]
*  motorbike that had been trailing the MP as he left parliament. And his driver and personal assistant [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  were unharmed. So clearly they only went for the MP, shot him at close range and disappeared. The [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=66.8s)]
*  aides then rushed him to hospital, which is not far away from where the incident happened, perhaps [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=74.72s)]
*  just a few minutes drive. But he was pronounced dead on arrival. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=81.12s)]
*  And what potential motives are police exploring? I understand [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=85.84s)]
*  the MP had previously complained of threats to his life before. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=90.32s)]
*  That's right. In recent weeks, the MP has spoken publicly about threats to his life [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  and repeatedly he has said that he is likely to be shot at. But he also expressed confidence that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=104.32s)]
*  because of his faith, he would be unharmed. And he did mention some names which I believe police [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=112.08s)]
*  would be investigating now. So it has come as a shock to the country. He comes from the western [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  region of the country, a supporter of the veteran opposition leader, Raila Odinga, who is currently [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=125.36s)]
*  in an arrangement with the president. And so he's been supporting the opposition leader who's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=131.84s)]
*  now working with the president. The issues that the MP has raised previously have come [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=138.08s)]
*  to the fore since his killing last night. And police are treating this as an assassination. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7bz8Hb2Hg&t=146.0s)]
