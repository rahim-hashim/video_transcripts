Video Description: Russia have attacked the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, after Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow caused the temporary closure of the city's airports overnight.

It is the second night in a row that Ukraine has attacked Moscow - and comes three days before a major parade in the city, marking victory in Europe in World War Two.

# Russian drones hit Kharkiv after Ukrainian attacks in Moscow | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8)
*  Russia says Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Moscow for the second night in a row. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=0.0s)]
*  All four of Moscow's major airports were closed temporarily in what officials say was a safety [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=6.08s)]
*  precaution. There are no reports of any casualties. Ukraine has not commented but the mayor of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=11.88s)]
*  Kharkiv said Russian drones had attacked the city and the Kyiv region overnight. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to speak to Frank Gardner now in Kyiv. What can we understand about what we think Ukraine is trying to achieve with this? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=25.159999999999997s)]
*  Sure, well I think it's worth reminding ourselves that as Britain and other countries are celebrating the victory in Europe Day, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=32.16s)]
*  the defeat of Nazi Germany at the end of the Second World War, there is still a full scale war raging here in this part of Europe. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=42.16s)]
*  And it's been kicking off overnight in both Moscow and in the border region. So although Ukraine hasn't publicly admitted to launching these drones, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  there's no question in anybody's mind these were Ukrainian drones that had been launched. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  And Moscow says that 105 drones were shot down, 19 of them over the Moscow region. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=64.24s)]
*  And even though none of them actually killed or wounded anybody, symbolically this is quite important. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=70.32s)]
*  It's embarrassing I think for President Putin, who is about to host and stage the symbolically very important Victory Day, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=78.32s)]
*  the so-called Dien Pobedyay, Victory Day at the end of the Great Patriotic War. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=87.32s)]
*  This is Friday, the big march passed through Red Square in Moscow. He doesn't want anything to disrupt that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=92.32s)]
*  So the fact that these drones are able to penetrate Moscow's air defences is really I think will be rattling people in Russia. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  At the same time the war goes on in the east of Ukraine on both sides of the border. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  You've got Russia saying it has managed to expel all the Ukrainian forces that it made their incursion into Russia in August last year. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine says that's not true, we are still fighting and we're still carrying out combat operations there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  At the same time Russia has been launching glide bombs. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=126.48s)]
*  These are big crude bombs fitted with fins and GPS satellite guidance systems that glide towards their target, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  often with up to a tonne and a half of explosives in their warhead. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  And these have been launched against the second city here in Ukraine, Kharkiv, and there have been a number of casualties there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  Where does all this leave efforts for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=151.56s)]
*  Well Ukraine signed up to a US proposal back on March 11th for a 30 day ceasefire. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=158.56s)]
*  Ukraine had proposed a kind of temporary, or a partial one, they said. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=164.56s)]
*  Well how about a ceasefire in the air and on the sea? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=168.56s)]
*  And America said, hey look we can go further than that, how about we do a comprehensive one? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=172.56s)]
*  And Ukraine, which was at the time still absolutely reeling from that dressing down that President Zelensky got in the Oval Office [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  from President Trump and his Vice President J.D. Vance, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine was very keen to appear compliant with any US demands, said absolutely, we'll sign up to that, 30 days, no worries. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  Russia didn't sign up to it and Ukraine was saying, well we hope you're going to put some pressure on them, they didn't. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  Instead Russia has proposed this temporary three day ceasefire over the period of the Victory Day celebrations [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=201.72s)]
*  and Ukraine is pretty cynical about that, they're saying, look, the Easter truce that President Putin proposed was broken very quickly, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=208.72s)]
*  actually both sides broke it, there were hundreds if not thousands of infractions of that truce, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=216.72s)]
*  so nobody here in Ukraine thinks that this truce is worth the paper it's written on. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=221.72s)]
*  Ukraine wants a full end to the war, so does Russia, but Russia wants it on its terms, which are unacceptable to Ukraine. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=225.8s)]
*  You mentioned there about the fighting being done by Ukrainian forces inside Russian borders that Russia denies, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=234.8s)]
*  what do we know about what's really happening on the ground there? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=241.8s)]
*  OK, so if you look at the map, the areas we're talking about Emma are absolutely tiny, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  I mean you would need to zoom right in to go right up, almost with a magnifying glass to see the area that Ukraine is operating in, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  it's right on the border, even when they made their incursion in in August and were able to seize about a thousand square kilometres of land, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=261.88s)]
*  it's still minuscule compared to the 20% roughly of Ukraine that Russia is now occupying, but it's symbolic, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=270.96s)]
*  so Ukraine was hoping by this to use it as a bargaining chip to say to Russia, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=277.96s)]
*  well look, we'll pull out of the areas we've taken if you pull out of some if not all of the areas you've taken, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=283.96s)]
*  that hasn't really worked, they're also hoping to create a buffer zone, again that's not really worked, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=289.96s)]
*  so what's going on there at the moment is that Ukraine is launching some limited strikes using drones and artillery [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  onto things like Russia's command post just inside the border, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  command posts that are launching drone strikes against Ukraine, they've been hitting them, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  they also did some mine clearing in the last 24 hours where they were able to drive a path reportedly through a Russian minefield, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  and then get armoured vehicles and infantry into just inside Russia, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=323.12s)]
*  so we're talking here about the Kursk and Belgarod oblast provinces just inside Russia, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=328.12s)]
*  enough to annoy President Putin, not enough to change the course of this war. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=334.12s)]
*  Frank Gardner, great to talk to you, Frank Gardner there in Kyiv, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=339.12s)]
*  now we have a live page running up on the BBC mobile app and on the BBC website, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=343.12s)]
*  it's got the latest on the Ukrainian drone attacks in Moscow and the Russian strike in Odessa, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=348.2s)]
*  you'll find that on the BBC news website or on the app on your mobile devices. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VykVS12Z8&t=353.2s)]
