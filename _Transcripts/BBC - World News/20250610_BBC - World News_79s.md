Video Description: Greta Thunberg deported, Israel says, after Gaza aid boat intercepted | BBC News
 
Israel says it has begun to deport 12 pro-Palestinian activists, including Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, whose Gaza-bound aid boat was seized by Israeli forces in the Mediterranean on Monday.
 
The Israeli foreign ministry said Thunberg departed Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning on a flight to France after she agreed to be deported.
 
But France said five of the six French activists had refused to sign their deportation orders and would now be brought before an Israeli judicial authority.
 
Their yacht, the Madleen, was intercepted while they tried to deliver a "symbolic" amount of aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel's naval blockade to highlight the humanitarian crisis there.

*  Twelve activists were trying to reach Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=3.68s)]
*  They say that they were trying to deliver a symbolic amount of aid [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=6.24s)]
*  to raise awareness of the humanitarian crisis there [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=10.4s)]
*  because of Israel's restrictions on the delivery of aid. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=13.76s)]
*  All of them were detained. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=18.0s)]
*  And now the Israeli Foreign Ministry is saying that, you know, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=20.2s)]
*  there is a process now for them to be deported. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=25.0s)]
*  The French Foreign Ministry announced that five French nationals [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=27.72s)]
*  refused to sign their deportation orders. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=32.88s)]
*  And reports say that they're going to remain in Israeli custody [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=35.68s)]
*  for 96 hours until they're forced deportation from the country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=40.08s)]
*  And reports suggest that they include the French Palestinian [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=44.92s)]
*  member of parliament, Rina Hassan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=49.44s)]
*  Now, the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=52.44s)]
*  was also part of this mission. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=56.16s)]
*  She has now left the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a picture of her on a flight. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=60.48s)]
*  And she's now travelling to France before she continues her journey back to Sweden. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=64.88s)]
*  So all these 12 activists are expected to be deported, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  if not today, in the next few days. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gh33-wJI8&t=77.24s)]
