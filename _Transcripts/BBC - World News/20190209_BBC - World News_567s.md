*  Being the first girl on BG media, it's kind of hard [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=117.52s)]
*  Because normally girls, I've no, like when I've seen girls [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=120.52s)]
*  It's always singing, I've never seen a girl be aggressive on a microphone [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=124.52s)]
*  And you know, through a camera, I've never seen a girl be aggressive [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  And you're laughing, your father's ashen [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  Slate at my contol, get some glasses [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=133.51999999999998s)]

*  Bring your boys, I'll bring ten times more [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=141.52s)]
*  No, wait a minute just pause [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=143.52s)]
*  Every other kid thinks I'm different in it because I'm little T, I'm different [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=145.52s)]
*  I'm not different, I'm like everybody else, I grew up on a council estate [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=148.52s)]
*  But I grew up in a place where people get robbed to earn money [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=151.52s)]
*  People have to sell drugs to earn money [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=154.52s)]
*  I'm not in a mainstream school, I'm not in where I go to a school [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=156.52s)]
*  If people come there they'll get jacked up in it [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=160.52s)]
*  People get hurt for nothing just for looking at someone in that school [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=162.52s)]
*  So the beef with little T all started because jealousy, right, basically [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=172.52s)]
*  It's just jealousy [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=177.52s)]
*  Someone was telling me she was trying to say stuff about me [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=193.52s)]
*  Two other people, so I just thought, mate, you're a good mate [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=196.52s)]
*  Simple as you're a birdie and you're trying to give me shit in it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=200.52s)]
*  So I just thought, I'll send for you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=203.52s)]
*  He thought I was taking his spotlight, so obviously he sent for me [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=216.52s)]
*  At first I wasn't going to send back, I was like, no, not a chance [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=220.52s)]
*  And then everyone was just like, it just went massive [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=224.52s)]
*  And I was like, well this could actually be like a chance of actually getting you somewhere [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=226.52s)]
*  So obviously I sent back and then it just became one big thing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=231.52s)]
*  I got addicted to sending, like not addicted but every single person who was on BG, mate [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=239.52s)]
*  I just thought, I'm going to send for you all to show you that I'm a kid but I can still do it [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=244.52s)]
*  And I did it, I sent for every single one of them on it, mate [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=248.52s)]
*  None of them sent back, mate, because they were all shook [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=251.52s)]
*  They were all shook, mate, from a 15-year-old kid [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=254.52s)]
*  With my mum being deaf, she can't really listen to me sing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=266.52s)]
*  She can't hear my music, but there's some songs where she can't hear the lyrics [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=269.52s)]
*  But she can hear the bass and she can hear a little bit and she'll go, I really like that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=274.52s)]
*  I really like that sound and she'll be like, oh [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=278.52s)]
*  And then because she can't hear the lyrics and learn them herself [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=281.52s)]
*  Obviously I'll write them down for her and she'll be there on a piece of paper for her [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=284.52s)]
*  So she knows exactly what I'm saying [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=287.52s)]
*  I was using that language because I was a kid, man, all my mates swear, innit [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=289.52s)]
*  I thought that was normal, innit, to be honest, like I thought that was [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=294.52s)]
*  All my other mates were swearing, so as a thought, they swear, I swear, innit [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=298.52s)]
*  I kind of made an idiot of myself on YouTube, that's what I did [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=303.52s)]
*  I made a big idiot of myself in front of everyone because I was just swearing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=309.52s)]
*  I was saying things that I didn't even know the real meaning of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=312.52s)]
*  And I was saying it on camera in front of millions of people [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=317.52s)]
*  Please stop, I hate listening to that, I hate listening to it [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=321.52s)]
*  What about the contents you were saying? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=326.52s)]
*  Exactly, that is the whole reason, the whole reason why I hate listening to it [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=328.52s)]
*  Is because the stuff that I'm listening to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=332.52s)]
*  At the time it was really exciting but now I'm older and I've grown up [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=342.52s)]
*  I look at it and I just look at it so immature and so childish [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=345.52s)]
*  But then on the other half it's like I don't regret it because that was such a good tactic [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=349.52s)]
*  To be able to get noticed because I think if it was just me doing songs [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=354.52s)]
*  And put them on a YouTube channel I don't think I would have actually got anywhere [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=358.52s)]
*  Because there's artists now that have been doing music for years [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=361.52s)]
*  And they've not even reached maybe a thousand views [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=364.52s)]
*  I make money bro what do you mean? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=384.52s)]
*  10 million views and I'm only 15 [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=386.52s)]
*  When I'm older yeah I'm gonna be supreme [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=389.52s)]
*  Like it's 2008 I've already told you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=391.52s)]
*  Spat it up and how could you do that? Hit it with a face when you had about 10 at the back [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=394.52s)]
*  Being bullied and I know what it's like That feeling inside that shit in your mind [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=398.52s)]
*  I wish I could turn back time when it all were fine [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=401.52s)]
*  I lot of hate but bad publicity is good publicity innit [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=404.52s)]
*  They're getting me views, they're making me pee innit [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=409.52s)]
*  People say that my grime's not nice but I'm getting filled by noisy advice [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=412.52s)]
*  Yeah and it's hard to be me people like [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=416.52s)]
*  Can I get a little pick with little tea? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=418.52s)]
*  Can I get a pick with little tea? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=420.52s)]
*  All these people send it for me [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=422.52s)]
*  Got to work my time you're not with the thinking that bad in my mind [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=424.52s)]
*  Got to be cruel to be kind to me [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=426.52s)]
*  It is horrible but I think because I went to school before that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=427.52s)]
*  And I was bullied before that and like the bullying was quite hard for me [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=430.52s)]
*  And I think because I kind of got over that I kind of grew [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=437.52s)]
*  And I kind of you know built this kind of block to like any kind of like negative emotion [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=441.52s)]
*  How much are they? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=449.52s)]
*  Quid like a bit something [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=450.52s)]

*  I'm grown up innit you know what I mean like [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=454.52s)]
*  If you saw me five month ago you would be like oh my god how have you changed in five month [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=456.52s)]
*  Like I swear I was just a kid I was still small I had a perm [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=462.52s)]
*  Yeah I'm more mature in my lyrics now like more I was talking about [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=468.52s)]
*  I don't always more talking about girls and stuff like that you know what I mean [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=472.52s)]
*  But now I'm talking about how it is in my situation as a 15 year old kid in Blackpool [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuDm8kDiYg&t=476.52s)]
