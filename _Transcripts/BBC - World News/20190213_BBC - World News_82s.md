**BBC - World News:** [February 13, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI)
*  This conviction is a victory for every family who has lost a loved one to the black hole of addiction. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=0.0s)]
*  This trial has pulled back the curtain on international drug dealing in a way that no other trial has. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=7.5s)]
*  It revealed that Guzman and his co-conspirators were responsible for smuggling hundreds of tons of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and marijuana into the United States. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=14.0s)]
*  It also revealed that they were only able to operate on that scale because of endemic corruption. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=29.0s)]
*  This is a day of reckoning, but there are more days of reckoning to come. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=36.0s)]
*  This is America and no matter who the defendant is, you still have to fight to the death. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=40.0s)]
*  No matter what people think, what society thinks, what the government thinks, we took that obligation incredibly seriously and as I said, we left nothing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=48.0s)]
*  Everything was left on the battlefield. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=57.0s)]
*  Do I think it was a fair trial? No. We wouldn't have objected at all if we thought the trial was completely fair. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=61.0s)]
*  No defense lawyers ever thought that they'd gotten a completely fair trial after there was a conviction. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=67.0s)]
*  And we were all honored to represent Joaquin Guzman and we're all honored to be a part of what we consider to be a historical trial. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGu-0GhYNgI&t=72.0s)]
