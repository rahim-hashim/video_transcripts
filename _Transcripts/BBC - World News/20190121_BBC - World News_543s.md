Video Description: Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn condemns the car bomb in Londonderry at the weekend.
He says that Parliament "cannot take for granted" the Good Friday Agreement.
He accuses the prime minister of going through the "motions" of trying to seek consensus but he says she is still "in denial".
He asks which of her red lines is "she prepared to move on".
He states that there was "no flexibility, no negotiations" in the cross-party talks that were held last week.
He welcomes the commitment that the fee for settled status will now be waived by the government.
"There is a clear majority in the House to support a deal and to respect the referendum result," he says, but he says the PM needs to work across the House.

# Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's response to the PM's statement - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 21, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M)
*  Jeremy Corbyn. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you Mr Speaker. I thank the Prime Minister for an advanced copy of her statement and I [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=4.08s)]
*  join with her in condemning the car bomb attack we've seen in London during the weekend and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  commend the emergency services and the local community for their response. Mr Speaker, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=13.68s)]
*  the huge achievement of the Good Friday agreement in reducing violence in Northern Ireland must [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=19.04s)]
*  never be taken for granted. It was an historic step forward but we cannot take it for granted. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=24.0s)]
*  The Government still appear not to have come to terms with the scale of the defeat in the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=29.6s)]
*  House of Commons last week. The Prime Minister seems to be going through the motions of accepting [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=34.0s)]
*  the results but in reality is in deep denial. The logic of that decisive defeat is that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=39.64s)]
*  the Prime Minister must change her red lines because her current deal is undeliverable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=46.32s)]
*  So can she be clear and explicit with the House which of her red lines is she prepared [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  to move on? The Prime Minister's invitation to talks have been exposed as a PR sham. Every [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=59.24s)]
*  opposition party politician came out of those meetings with the same response. Contrary [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=66.92s)]
*  to what the Prime Minister's just said, there was no flexibility, there were no negotiations, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=78.12s)]
*  nothing has changed. Order! The Prime Minister was heard and when there was noise I called [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=85.12s)]
*  for it to stop and the same must apply to the Leader of the Opposition. No one in this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=94.76s)]
*  Chamber will shout the right honourable gentleman down. Don't even bother trying, you're [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=98.84s)]
*  wasting your breath. Jeremy Corbyn. Thank you Mr Speaker but I do welcome the commitment [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=102.76s)]
*  of that the fee for EU citizens to apply for settled status will be waived. Mr Speaker, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=108.2s)]
*  the Prime Minister was fond of saying that this is the best possible deal on the table, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=114.32s)]
*  it is the only possible deal on the table. But our EU negotiating partners are clear [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  and I quote, unanimously the European Council have always said that if the UK chooses to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  shift its red lines in the future to go beyond a simple free trade agreement then the EU [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=132.12s)]
*  immediately ready to give a favourable response. The House voted to hold the referendum, it [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=139.44s)]
*  also voted to trigger article 50. There is a clear majority of this House to support [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=146.84s)]
*  a deal in principle and to respect the referendum result but it requires the Prime Minister [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=152.12s)]
*  to face reality and accept her deal has been comprehensively defeated. Instead we now understand [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=158.44s)]
*  the Prime Minister is going back to Europe to seek concessions on the backstop. Can I [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=167.8s)]
*  ask the Prime Minister this, what is the difference between legal assurances and concessions? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  What makes her think that what she tried to renegotiate in December will succeed in January? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  This really does feel a bit like Groundhog Day. So the first thing she must do is recognise [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=187.08s)]
*  the clear majority in this House against leaving without a deal and rule out no deal and stop [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=195.2s)]
*  the colossal waste of public money planning for an outcome. Questions too must be asked [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=203.64s)]
*  of the Chancellor. He reassured businesses that no deal would be ruled out by the Commons [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  he is sanctioning Â£4.2 billion to be spent on an option he believes will be ruled out. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=218.52s)]
*  The Foreign Secretary said last week it was very unrealistic to believe the House of Commons [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=226.12s)]
*  would not find a way to block no deal. Mr Speaker, can I ask the Prime Minister to meet [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  first with her Chancellor and her Foreign Secretary and see if they can convince her [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=236.8s)]
*  to do what is in her power to rule out no deal? If she will not do that now, will she [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=241.68s)]
*  confirm to the House that if an amendment passes that rules out no deal, she will implement [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=248.08s)]
*  that instruction? The Prime Minister agreed the backstop because of her pledge to the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=254.96s)]
*  people of Northern Ireland to avoid a hard border, but no deal would mean a hard border [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=260.16s)]
*  in Ireland and break the Prime Minister's commitment. Is she seriously willing to accept [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=266.48s)]
*  a hard border? Today heralds the start of a democratic process, where this House will [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  debate amendments that will determine how we navigate Brexit. Of course the Government [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=278.72s)]
*  tried to block us ever getting to this stage. They wanted us to have no democratic scrutiny [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=283.88s)]
*  whatsoever. Labour set out, and I believe there may be a majority in the House, for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=289.24s)]
*  such a proposal for a new comprehensive customs union with the EU that would include a say, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=294.52s)]
*  a strong single market deal that delivers frictionless trade and ensure no race to the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=303.24s)]
*  bottom on workers' rights or indeed any other of the important regulations and protections [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  we have. We will, as we have said consistently from the beginning, back amendments that seek [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=316.28s)]
*  to rule out the disaster of no deal and, as we have said, will not rule out the option [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=322.4s)]
*  of a public vote. So, Mr Speaker, no more phony talks. Parliament will debate and decide. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=328.0s)]
*  This time, Mr Speaker, I hope and expect the Government to listen to this House. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=335.0s)]
*  Mr Speaker, can I just say to the right hon. Gentleman that he says no more phony talks. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=344.0s)]
*  It would be nice just to have some talks with him on this issue. He makes lots of claims [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=351.0s)]
*  about what has been said in the talks that have been held so far, but actually he does [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=360.52s)]
*  not know, because he did not turn up to those talks. I come back to him and he makes a great [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=364.44s)]
*  deal about the issue of no deal. He said that there is a consensus, I think he said there [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=372.4s)]
*  was a view across this House that supported a deal in principle and wanted to deliver [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  on Brexit. That is exactly what I want to sit down and talk to him about, because what [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=382.44s)]
*  we need to see is what is it that will secure the support of this House to enable us to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=388.44s)]
*  leave the European Union with a deal. We are continuing to listen to groups across the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=395.08s)]
*  House in order to find a way to secure that support. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=400.88s)]
*  He talks about ruling out no deal. As I said in my statement, there are only two ways that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=404.52s)]
*  you can ensure that no deal does not happen. One is to revoke article 50, to reverse the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=411.4s)]
*  decision of the referendum and to stay in the European Union. That would be a betrayal [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=418.0s)]
*  of the referendum decision that was taking place in 2016. The other way is to agree a [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=422.28s)]
*  deal with the European Union. It is precisely about finding a way that we can secure the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=429.56s)]
*  support of this House for a deal that I am talking with Members across the House about [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=435.38s)]
*  and want to talk with the right hon. Gentleman about. I hope from what he said today that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=440.8s)]
*  he will reconsider his decision not to attend those talks. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=444.16s)]
*  He asked me toâhe complained about the amount of money that was being spent. He talked [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=448.72s)]
*  about Â£4.2 billion being spent and how that money should actually be spent in other ways. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=453.2s)]
*  I see the Labour party have put out a press release saying that money should be spent [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=459.24s)]
*  in other ways. What the right hon. Gentleman might not have noticed is that actually that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=461.8s)]
*  Â£4.2 billion is not all money that is being spent on no deal. If we stopped spending that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=467.12s)]
*  money then we would not be prepared for a deal either. So he needs to recognise that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=472.16s)]
*  actually Government have to spend money to ensure that we are in a position, whatever [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=478.08s)]
*  of the negotiations with the European Union, whether we leave with a deal or in a no deal [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=485.52s)]
*  circumstance. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=492.08s)]
*  So I say once again to the right hon. Gentleman and across the House, for those who are concerned [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=493.08s)]
*  about no deal, that means we should be leaving with a deal. But what we need to find is the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=499.91999999999996s)]
*  way that this Houseâwe can secure the support of this House for a deal. What has been clear [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=506.2s)]
*  from the discussions that we have had so far is the wide variety of views that are held [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=512.7600000000001s)]
*  around this House on this issue. But when it comes to it, we all need to be able to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=517.5600000000001s)]
*  look our constituents in the eye and say that we did the right thing by them. That is leaving [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=525.2s)]
*  with a deal that ensures we deliver on the referendum and protect their jobs. That is [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=532.5200000000001s)]
*  what the Government are about, that is what we are working on and that is what we will [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  deliver. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2N17v3250M&t=541.9200000000001s)]
