# Unexploded World War Two bomb causes travel chaos in Paris | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo)
*  All trains to and from Europe's busiest train station, the Gare du Nord in Paris, have been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=0.0s)]
*  halted after an unexploded World War II bomb was found on the tracks in a nearby suburb. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=5.2s)]
*  Police blocked rail traffic to and from the station after the bomb was found in the Saint-Denis [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=12.64s)]
*  district. The terminal handles nearly 600,000 passengers daily, serving high-speed national [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=16.72s)]
*  and international services, including Eurostar. Eurostar is saying that services between London [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=23.34s)]
*  and Paris are currently suspended, but the trains are running between London and Brussels [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=28.82s)]
*  and Amsterdam as normal. In a statement, Eurostar wrote, due to an object on the tracks near [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  Paris Gare du Nord, we're expecting disruption to our services this morning. Please change [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=39.9s)]
*  your journey for a different date of travel. So let's speak to freelance journalist who [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=45.22s)]
*  joins us live from Paris, Morgan Ayer. Morgan, welcome to BBC News. Of course, a developing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  story, but just bring us up to date with what you know. This bomb, unexploded World [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=55.66s)]
*  War II bomb, was found very early in the morning. Yes, that's right. Workers who were doing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=61.22s)]
*  some kind of usual maintenance work at around 4 a.m. were doing earth moving work on the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=68.06s)]
*  tracks. It's about a mile outside Gare du Nord. They discovered this unexploded bomb [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=73.3s)]
*  from World War II. In itself, this isn't very unusual because bombs such as this are found [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=78.22s)]
*  fairly regularly throughout France, but it is quite unusual to be in such basically such [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=84.0s)]
*  a densely populated area such as the Gare du Nord area. As you said, very, very busy [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=89.44s)]
*  station, one of Europe's busiest. There's images you've probably seen of hundreds of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=95.48s)]
*  people kind of stuck at the station, not knowing where to go. A lot of all services pretty [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=100.16s)]
*  much in and out mostly have been cancelled. That includes obviously Eurostar's to London, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=105.56s)]
*  but also at Gare du Nord it also has the Metro as well. So I think there's going to be a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=111.52s)]
*  lot of people around that area very confused, not knowing what to do. Now, the transport [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=116.0s)]
*  minister has said it's not dangerous, but they obviously do have to follow procedure. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=122.36s)]
*  And he also said that, well, we expect that some services might be back up and running [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=127.08s)]
*  by the afternoon, but obviously that remains to be seen. Yeah, Morgan, I think we're sort [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=132.16s)]
*  of expecting around midday local time, another statement from Eurostar. But just when it [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=135.72s)]
*  comes to Gare du Nord itself, of course, as Eurostar terminal, but and you mentioned the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=141.06s)]
*  Metro there as well. But the trains from Gare du Nord, they go to other parts of France [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=145.18s)]
*  as well. Yes, they go to well, actually, they go to the airport at Charles de Gaulle, which [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=150.78s)]
*  is a massive, it's France's major main airport. They also go to Amsterdam, as you said, Brussels, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=155.54s)]
*  different parts of France as well. It is a major, major station in Paris and in Europe, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=162.02s)]
*  as you said. It's also Paris Fashion Week at the minute. So there's lots of people coming [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=167.18s)]
*  in and out for that. Even today, you know, you've got big shows like Victoria Beckham, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=172.38s)]
*  Issey Miyake, stuff like that. So it is a very, it's a major station and this will cause [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  commuters a lot of a lot of problems. And just for, of course, London, Paris Fashion [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=181.94s)]
*  Week as well. So, yeah, really particularly busy in the French capital. Just in terms [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=187.66s)]
*  when you say that these kind of unexploded Second World War devices, they do come up [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=193.22s)]
*  every now and again in Paris, because, of course, during the Second World War, the Allies [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=198.42s)]
*  were targeting those rail routes while Paris was occupied by the Nazi Germany regime, the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=203.78s)]
*  Vichy regime. So just how often does something like this, this kind of unexploded armament, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=210.94s)]
*  how often does that happen, Morgan? It is fairly regularly. And as you said, France [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=217.74s)]
*  was occupied during the war. So it happens every every now and then, but it's not in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  an area such as so busy as in Paris, Gare du Nord. But they do come up and as I said [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=227.3s)]
*  a little bit earlier, the transport minister said they do have, they have a very wide security [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=233.5s)]
*  perimeter to kind of deal with this safely and efficiently. They've got police bomb disposal [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=237.06s)]
*  units on hand dealing with the situation. OK, Morgan, joining us live from Paris, thank [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=242.9s)]
*  you very much for bringing us up to date and just for our audience as well, just to let [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=250.3s)]
*  you know that we do have a live page when it comes to what is happening in the French [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=254.86s)]
*  capital. And as I was saying, we're expecting an update from Eurostar, but it's not just [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=258.9s)]
*  Eurostar as Morgan was saying there. It's also local train services at Gare du Nord [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=264.22s)]
*  also feeding into Charles de Gaulle Airport as well affected. So a lot of disruption when [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=268.94s)]
*  it comes to the French capital. Also, it's a Paris Fashion Week as well. So a lot of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=275.14s)]
*  people in the French capital. We will bring you up to date and we are expecting an update [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=279.82s)]
*  from the Eurostar spokespeople shortly as well. But just to let you know, it's the London [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  to Paris trains that have been cancelled on Eurostar when it comes to London to Brussels [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=294.54s)]
*  and London to Amsterdam. That is still running. But much more on our website. We'll keep an [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  eye on it here. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro81mHp3bHo&t=304.1s)]
