Video Description: At least 25 arrests have been made during a worldwide operation against child abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the European Union's law enforcement organisation Europol has said.
 
The suspects were part of a criminal group whose members engaged in distributing fully AI-generated images of minors, according to the agency.
 
The operation is one of the first involving such child sexual abuse material and the lack of national legislation against these crimes made it "exceptionally challenging for investigators‚Äù, (CSAM), Europol says.
  
Danish law enforcement led the arrests on Wednesday, and authorities from at least 18 other countries have been involved too.

# Arrests over AI-generated child abuse material | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE)
*  We start with the breaking news that the EU's anti-crime agency Europol says at least 25 people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=0.0s)]
*  have been arrested in connection with AI-generated child sex abuse material. The suspects were [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=6.4s)]
*  engaged in the distribution of the images of minors fully generated by artificial intelligence. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=12.32s)]
*  It has been one of the first cases involving AI-generated child sexual abuse material. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's get more from our correspondent Anna Hologun who covers The Hague where Europol [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=25.04s)]
*  is headquartered. She's in Scotland at the moment. Anna, what more do we know about this operation? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=29.68s)]
*  This is one of the first ever operations targeting AI-generated images of child sexual [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=36.16s)]
*  abuse. We've just had the details from Europol in the last half an hour. So the main suspect here [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=42.56s)]
*  at Danish National, he was arrested last November. He was running an online platform, Europol says, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=48.72s)]
*  where he distributed these AI-generated images that he had produced. Following an online payment, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=54.64s)]
*  users from around the world were able to get a password and then access this material which [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  shows children being abused. Now, you might instantly think, well, these are AI-generated [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=67.12s)]
*  images, so perhaps less harmful than real life images. In actual fact, there are a number of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=73.28s)]
*  challenges here. So first of all, the proliferation of these images and the ease at which they're able [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=79.84s)]
*  to be generated makes it harder for investigators to track down the perpetrators, but also the real [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=86.4s)]
*  world victims of child sexual abuse. And because the technology is so easy to use, more and more [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=93.68s)]
*  of these images are being created, AI-generated images. But also it's a huge new realm for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  investigators, and they haven't quite got on top of the technology. So this is a huge success. And [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=107.68s)]
*  the results of this operation, which has been codenamed Operation Cumbernauld, 273 suspects [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  have been identified, 25 people arrested, 33 house searches, and 173 items seized. So this is a major [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=122.0s)]
*  breakthrough for Europol and all of the other countries involved in this global operation to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=132.8s)]
*  target the AI-generated, the creators of this AI-generated child sexual abuse. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=138.8s)]
*  And you mentioned there more than 270 suspects identified, an operation across several countries. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=144.88s)]
*  Just tell us a bit more about the scale of this operation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=151.04s)]
*  A huge scale. I'm just looking at the countries now. So the authorities were involved in a number [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=155.12s)]
*  of countries all around the world, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia, Czech Republic, Denmark, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=160.96s)]
*  Finland, France, Germany, Hungary. This is just giving you a scale of the problem. So this was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  either people who were generating these images, the Danish national, or people who were viewing, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=173.28s)]
*  accessing this kind of material. And the other concern is, of course, that this material, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=179.28s)]
*  although it's AI-generated, can also lead to the objectification and abuse of children in the real [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=185.84s)]
*  world. So this is a huge issue, a huge concern. Also authorities involved in Germany, Hungary, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and in the UK [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=198.96s)]
*  as well. So the next step, Europol has said, is about preventing future crimes. They're not only [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=205.6s)]
*  focusing on stopping the perpetrators, but also taking proactive steps, they say, to prevent [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=212.0s)]
*  further incidents. Taking down this platform is one, but more and more of these images, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=217.84s)]
*  self-generated images of child sexual abuse, are being created all the time. So they're working [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=224.4s)]
*  with all of those countries, EU member states, to try to ensure that they can stop these kinds of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=230.96s)]
*  crimes being committed and protect the kinds of victims who are exposed to this harm, both [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  online and in the real world. Anna, thank you. I think that Anna Hologun there, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=243.28s)]
*  talking to us about that breaking news, Europol unveiling a large-scale operation against child [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=250.4s)]
*  sexual exploitation generated by AI, an operation with several countries around the world. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRj-8G9eWhE&t=255.92000000000002s)]
