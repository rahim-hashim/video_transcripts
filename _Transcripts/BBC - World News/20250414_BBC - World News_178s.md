Video Description: Katy Perry and five other women are set to blast into space aboard Jeff Bezos' space tourism rocket.
 
The singer will be joined by Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King.
 
They are due to lift off from its West Texas launch site and the launch window opens at 08:30 local time (14:30 BST).
 
The flight will last around 11 minutes and take the crew more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving the crew a few moments of weightlessness.
 
Also on board are former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.
