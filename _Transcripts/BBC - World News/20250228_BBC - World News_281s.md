Video Description: People in Greece are holding their biggest protests for years and taking part in a general strike to mark the second anniversary of a rail disaster that left 57 dead and dozens more injured.
 
Tempers have flared and clashes have broken out with police, while bombs were thrown and police used tear gas.
 
On 28 February 2023, a passenger train packed with students collided head-on with a goods train near the Tempi gorge in central Greece.
 
An inquiry concluded on Thursday that the accident was caused by human error, poor maintenance, and inadequate staffing.
 
"Those children were killed because the train was not safe," said Christos Papadimitriou, chief of Greece's Air and Rail Accident Investigation Authority.

# Mass protests in Greece on train tragedy anniversary | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U)
*  Hello and welcome to BBC News Now. I'm Kashia Madeira. We're going to take you straight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=0.0s)]
*  away to live shots that we have been monitoring here on BBC News from Athens, the capital [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=6.0s)]
*  of Greece, because this is where we are continuing to see protesters out on the streets. Hundreds [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  of hooded protesters throwing petrol bombs at police in Athens, where thousands of people [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=19.92s)]
*  have been gathering to mark two years since Greece's worst ever rail disaster. We're monitoring [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=25.12s)]
*  these live shots across BBC News here of these clashes outside the Parliament building as [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=32.92s)]
*  officers are trying to disperse these crowds with tear gas. Now, this has been going on [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=38.92s)]
*  for a number of hours, demonstrators saying that they want justice for the 57 people who [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=44.24s)]
*  were killed when a passenger service collided with a freight train near the Tempi Gorge [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=50.92s)]
*  two years ago. Now, joining us throughout these protests as we've been monitoring these [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=56.56s)]
*  live shots is our news reporter, Nikos Papanikolaou, who is with us. And Nikos, just remind us [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=62.2s)]
*  as to the background to why we're seeing thousands of people on the streets really [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=70.12s)]
*  angry. It's because of that train crash two years ago. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=75.08s)]
*  I think it's because of the train crash two years ago. It's the deadliest train crash [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=79.2s)]
*  in country's history, but I would say it's also an anti-government protest that is taking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=82.2s)]
*  place. People have been protesting for decades of corruption and as long as, as well with [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=86.56s)]
*  the train crash, this is the main reason they are on the streets right now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=96.12s)]
*  Of course, because we're talking about a train crash that happened two years ago, but obviously [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=100.04s)]
*  anger that people are feeling because of what they perceive as the lack of justice. There's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=106.2s)]
*  a judicial investigation which remains unfinished and no one has been convicted after what is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=110.64s)]
*  described as Greece's deadliest train crash. But also, of course, we know, Nikos, that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=116.28s)]
*  there's a lot of mistrust in Greece with the government following the debt crisis that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=121.84s)]
*  we've been seeing in which millions of people lost out on wages and pensions and public [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=127.56s)]
*  services suffered from underfunding. So a lot of mistrust when it comes to the Greek [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=132.84s)]
*  people and the authorities. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=137.6s)]
*  We had a lot of scandals, I would say, apart from the train crash. We had the surveillance [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=139.6s)]
*  scandal a few years ago where we found out that the Greece national intelligence agency [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=145.04s)]
*  was spying on people and there has been no responsible for that as far as we are aware. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=151.36s)]
*  And then we had the train crash, of course, that angered people up to the way that they [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=158.0s)]
*  took over the streets and now we've seen all the pictures of protesters basically throwing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  petrol bombs. But as you were saying, I think there is a huge issue of mistrust towards [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  the government. They are not feeling that the justice is transparent enough. They're [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=173.72s)]
*  not feeling justice has been served for all these issues. And on the other hand, the government [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=179.52s)]
*  is not doing enough to address those issues. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=184.8s)]
*  And Nico, I guess it's important just to put this into context because protests do happen [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  in Greece. But just help us to understand that what we're seeing today is this more [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=194.12s)]
*  or less violent in terms of the throwing of petrol bombs, the number of police out on [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  the streets. Put this into context for us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=205.4s)]
*  I think it's the biggest protest I've ever seen in my life. And I've covered like a lot [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  of protests in Greece. We've seen more than 6,000 police officers being deployed over [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=213.94s)]
*  there. We have anti-terrorists and riot police over there. We have drones and helicopters [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=218.5s)]
*  flying over the Syntagma Square in Athens. Just to put into context, it's a really big [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=224.38s)]
*  one. And to be fair, I was expecting those sort of clashes to happen. It's quite common [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=231.5s)]
*  for classes in Greece and protests, this sort of situation that they involve to a petrol [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=239.5s)]
*  bomb war between the protesters and the riot police. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=245.62s)]
*  But this is in your terms a big one that we're experiencing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=251.9s)]
*  The biggest one I've ever seen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=254.78s)]
*  Wow, Nikos. Papa, Nicolaou, thank you very much for being with us throughout the days. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=256.22s)]
*  We've been monitoring what you describe as Greece's biggest protest that we've been seeing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=260.82s)]
*  Of course, we're continuing to monitor the live shots coming from Athens and Greece. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=265.82s)]
*  And there are numerous protests across the country following that two-year anniversary [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=270.58s)]
*  of Greece's deadliest train crash. So of course, we'll bring much more on that throughout the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=274.9s)]
*  programme. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Pg48P8F1U&t=280.54s)]
