**BBC - World News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM)
*  Hello and welcome if you have just joined us to our BBC News special on the Oscar nominations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=0.0s)]
*  In the next five minutes we will start to hear who is going to be heading to the Academy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=6.76s)]
*  Awards in March. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=11.76s)]
*  Joining me in the studio is our culture correspondent Charlotte Gallagher and also film critic and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=13.32s)]
*  editor-at-large at Empire magazine Helen O'Hara. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  We also have the popcorn ready. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=22.8s)]
*  We are of course slightly different this year with the Oscar nominations because of the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=25.12s)]
*  Los Angeles fires. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=30.48s)]
*  So Charlotte there isn't going to be the normal press at this event in the next few minutes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=32.2s)]
*  No it's going to be a very pared down ceremony essentially. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=36.8s)]
*  They're just going to announce what is happening and I imagine they'll make some statement [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=40.44s)]
*  probably about the fires in Los Angeles because so many people involved in the entertainment [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=44.92s)]
*  industry have lost everything in the fires. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=50.0s)]
*  The people involved in the fires of the Academy have lost everything and we've been talking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=53.76s)]
*  that perhaps some people might not even be able to do their vote because they're not [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=57.4s)]
*  in their home, they've been relocated. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=61.32s)]
*  I mean it's just been absolutely devastating for people in Los Angeles and it just wouldn't [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  be right to have an all singing all dancing kind of nomination announcement when people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=68.48s)]
*  are really really suffering. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=73.56s)]
*  OK one person who is in Los Angeles and who is waiting is film producer Sandro Manetti [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=75.72s)]
*  Now he knows the film industry very well but he has a personal reason for being ready for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=81.52s)]
*  the Oscars. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=88.36s)]
*  He's got his fingers crossed there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=89.36s)]
*  It's because you're actually, you might be nominated Sandro. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=90.52s)]
*  Just explain to our audience why. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=94.24s)]
*  I am one of the executive producers of Room Taken which is a charming short film about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  the unique bond between a blind woman and a homeless man. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=103.96s)]
*  Colin Farrell is also an executive producer on this film and yes we're just hoping like [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=107.72s)]
*  so many others that dreams might come true in a few minutes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=113.64s)]
*  My delight or joy is going to play out around the world. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=117.56s)]
*  Stay tuned. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=120.68s)]
*  Yeah absolutely we are going to get your reaction but on the thing that we were mentioning before [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=121.68s)]
*  the fires in Los Angeles how much of an impact has that had on the industry that you are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=126.32s)]
*  part of? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=131.04s)]
*  Well 60% of Academy voters live right here in Los Angeles so an absolute huge impact. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=132.88s)]
*  You know for many of us the Oscar nominations represents almost a return to normalcy and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=140.8s)]
*  something quite comforting at this difficult time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  I think the Academy have played it right without putting on this as you say all singing or [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=150.8s)]
*  all dancing sort of presentation but the Oscars will go ahead. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=156.68s)]
*  The delayed nominations today, the ceremony on March the 2nd so yeah it's a celebration [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=160.04s)]
*  of all the talent in this town and the extended talent around the world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  Okay we are going to cross very shortly to the announcement in Los Angeles which is in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=172.92s)]
*  two parts. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  So Sandro's in the first part along with the best supporting actor and actress and then [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  there is a three minute little gap where to be brutally honest the American new channel [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=186.0s)]
*  that takes this takes an ad break where we will come back and get Sandro's reaction and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=191.36s)]
*  then of course we will get the big ones for best movie and best actor and actress. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=195.76s)]
*  Charlotte what do we need to be looking out for? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=202.4s)]
*  We need to be looking out for some really big names. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=204.76s)]
*  Things that we think are going to do very well in the nominations so the brutalist we're [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=207.2s)]
*  Conclave which as KJ described earlier it's like the Real Housewives of Vatican City. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=211.84s)]
*  It's this very funny catty drama about choosing the next Pope with a real classy cast. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=217.84s)]
*  Wicked one of the blockbusters that could do really well. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=224.44s)]
*  Cynthia Erivo will she become an EGOT? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=227.4s)]
*  Will she finally get her Oscar? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  Ariana Grande could she be nominated? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=231.16s)]
*  Selena Gomez for Emilia Perez could she get a nomination? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=232.76s)]
*  Emilia Perez we're expecting to do quite well. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=236.24s)]

*  She's had this huge comeback. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=248.96s)]
*  She talked about how she was described as a popcorn actress. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=250.46s)]
*  She wasn't taken seriously. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=252.82s)]

*  And hey, stick with us. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=639.22s)]
*  Stick with us. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=640.78s)]
*  We'll be right back with more, more, more nominations. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=641.78s)]
*  Yes! [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=644.66s)]
*  She's very good. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=645.66s)]
*  So that is the first part of the nomination process. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=647.86s)]
*  We have to go back to Sandro Manetti in Los Angeles. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=652.18s)]
*  Commiserations, Sandro. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=656.1s)]
*  It's an honor just to be shortlisted. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=660.3s)]
*  You should have gone for the acting prize. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=661.9799999999999s)]
*  Sorry you didn't make it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=665.3s)]
*  Yes, I don't think acting is my future, but I'm very encouraged to stick with producing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=667.9s)]
*  You know, it's great to be in the shortlist and actually after 20 years sort of covering [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=673.0999999999999s)]
*  the Oscars as a reporter to actually have a film that had a chance was great. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=678.18s)]
*  But you know, all of us involved, we will be back in future to get this. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=683.42s)]
*  And you know, we're in good company. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=689.02s)]
*  I think the likes of Angelina, Jo Lee, Nicole Kidman, you know, will also be on that sort [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=690.66s)]
*  of bubble in the next section of awards as well. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=697.02s)]
*  So we ran it close. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=699.98s)]
*  Get your next year. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=701.18s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us, Sandro. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=703.02s)]
*  We do appreciate your time. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=704.46s)]
*  Helen, so surprise for me because we won't now see Selena versus Ariana. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=705.98s)]
*  We won't. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=712.8s)]
*  I think it was maybe always, it's always difficult when there's two supporting in the same film [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=713.8s)]
*  or two leads in the same film, which arguably Ariana was, you know, was kind of a lead. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=718.1s)]
*  But but yeah, it's a shame, I think, for, you know, probably for the audiences at home, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=723.9s)]
*  certainly for the fans of Selena Gomez. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=728.38s)]
*  And and yeah, she'll be hoping to be in with another chance. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=731.02s)]
*  But look, her career is only going up and up. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  So I don't think that's that's her last chance at an Oscar. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=736.78s)]
*  And also, I noticed adapted screenplay writing Wicked wasn't in there. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=739.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=744.34s)]
*  That's a good sign, is it, for Best Picture if they didn't get an adapted screenplay nomination. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=745.34s)]
*  We both kind of went, oh, when that was announced. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=750.5s)]
*  So that I think they'll be hugely, hugely disappointed that they've gotten not got a [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=753.1800000000001s)]
*  nomination in that category. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=757.22s)]
*  Currently Brutalist, Conclave, Wicked, Complete Unknown and Amelia Perez all have four nominations [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=759.1800000000001s)]
*  each because you asked me to do a tally, Nicola. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=764.26s)]
*  I have been doing a tally with a pen and paper. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=766.0600000000001s)]
*  They're leading the race currently with four each. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=768.3000000000001s)]
*  Because the most nominations ever, 14. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=771.22s)]
*  Yeah. So there was some talk as to whether Amelia Perez might reach that number. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=774.9s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's been a real runaway success, hasn't it? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=780.22s)]
*  In the award ceremony so far. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=783.38s)]
*  And it's something that I don't think anyone anticipated. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=784.82s)]
*  Probably even the people working on the film didn't expect it to do this well. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=788.06s)]
*  As we said, it's been such a divisive film. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=791.9s)]
*  People either love it or they hate it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=794.66s)]
*  That's exactly it. And I think it is a surprise that it was dominant to that extent at the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=796.86s)]
*  Golden Globes and even in the BAFTAs. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=801.22s)]
*  It was the second most nominated film. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=802.78s)]
*  So I think, look, I think, you know, not having two nods for best supporting actress is probably [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=804.66s)]
*  not a great sign for it, you know, beating records at least. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=810.86s)]
*  But it's still doing very, very well to be up there with things like The Brutalist, I think, is a good sign for it. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=814.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, we have the big ones to come. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=819.22s)]
*  Sandro, before you leave us, who would be your bet on walking away with best movie this year? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=821.5s)]
*  I'm going to think that it's so close that it's going to come down to the film that people least object to because of the way Oscar voting is. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=830.34s)]
*  So I think more left field choices like The Brutalist and Amelia Perez will struggle. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=841.34s)]
*  I think Conclave will come through. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=846.26s)]
*  My choice would be Sing Sing, but Conclave for me. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=848.58s)]
*  They'll send Wipesphoto the Academy. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=852.02s)]
*  Sandro, thank you very much for your time. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=854.46s)]
*  Sandro, thank you very much for your time. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=856.46s)]
*  We're going to head back very shortly to get the big nominations. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=857.74s)]
*  Charlotte, anything we need to be watching out for here? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=860.6600000000001s)]
*  So it's Best Picture, isn't it? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=862.74s)]
*  Who is going to get the nominations for Best Picture? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=864.3000000000001s)]
*  So we're expecting, as Sandro said, Brutalist, Conclave, a complete unknown. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=867.38s)]
*  I think might squeak in as well. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=871.86s)]
*  I think The Substance. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=874.0600000000001s)]
*  I have a really good feeling about The Substance. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=875.4200000000001s)]
*  It's one of my favourite films of the past year. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=877.86s)]
*  And I think perhaps it could do it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=880.7800000000001s)]
*  Also, watch Best Editing. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=883.38s)]
*  You don't generally win Best Picture without Best Editing. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=885.02s)]
*  OK, let's head back to Los Angeles. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=887.34s)]
*  We're in a hotel lobby. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=890.66s)]
*  And we're back live. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=892.9s)]
*  Before we continue, I just want to say it's really special to be here with Rachel. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=894.9399999999999s)]
*  We both got our start in the New York alt-comedy scene. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=899.66s)]
*  Yeah, we go way back. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=902.78s)]
*  For those of you who don't know, the alt-comedy scene is sort of like [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=904.54s)]
*  regular comedy, but for women and gay people. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=907.66s)]
*  And I just want to say it makes so much sense that Bowen and I are like [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=911.74s)]
*  doing this now at this moment in our careers. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=914.62s)]
*  You know, Bowen is such a huge star on SNL. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=918.18s)]
*  He's in the hit movie Wicked. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=920.7s)]
*  Oh, thanks. And Rachel is Fatima. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=922.34s)]
*  Thanks so much. Let's keep going. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=928.02s)]

*  We are rooting for you all in equal amounts. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1352.5s)]
*  Yes. Watch the Oscars live hosted by Conan O'Brien on Sunday, March 2nd at 7pm Eastern, 4pm Pacific on ABC and Hulu. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1355.5s)]
*  We cannot wait to celebrate with you. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1364.5s)]
*  We're gonna party. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1366.5s)]
*  Bye. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1368.5s)]
*  So there we go, live from Los Angeles. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1371.5s)]
*  We have the full list. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1373.5s)]
*  Joining us here on our BBC News special as well is Rhianne Dillon, the film critic for Six Music. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1374.5s)]
*  Still with me, Charlotte and Helen. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1380.5s)]
*  So, Helen, surprises. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1382.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there was a bit of talk for Nicole Kidman, maybe for Baby Girl, for Best Actress, and Angelina Jolie for Maria. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1385.5s)]
*  I think they were probably, as our guest said, on the bubble a little bit for those. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1396.5s)]
*  Otherwise, I think it's much as predicted. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1400.5s)]
*  Emilie Perez has done extremely well, better than I personally would have chosen. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1402.5s)]
*  Interesting not to see Conclave get a Best Director nod, though. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1408.5s)]
*  That's a bad sign for its Best Picture chances. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1411.5s)]
*  Usually, if you're going to win Best Picture, you need a nomination for Best Editing and Best Director to go along with it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1414.5s)]
*  So it's a little bit worrying that it's not in there. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1420.5s)]
*  But otherwise, it's pretty much, I think, as we predicted. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1422.5s)]
*  Rhianne, we mentioned earlier, Carla Sophia Guscon is now the first ever trans actor to get an Oscar nomination. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1426.5s)]
*  Yes. I mean, that's an incredible feat. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1436.5s)]
*  And actually, I don't know about the feelings in the room. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1438.5s)]
*  I think it's really well deserved. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1441.5s)]
*  I think she does give a very good performance, an incredible performance. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1442.5s)]
*  I think the cast is great. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1445.5s)]
*  I just don't love the film. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1446.5s)]
*  I think the performances are brilliant, but I just I didn't love the songs either. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1448.5s)]
*  Oh, really? I think I think Zoe Saldana's kind of magnus opus that she does is phenomenal. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1452.5s)]
*  And so like kind of barnstorming and energetic. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1458.5s)]
*  I love that. And I think that Guscon is not necessarily doesn't have to be the strongest singer, I think. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1460.5s)]
*  But I think her arc is something that we have genuinely not really seen in such an authentic way on screen before. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1466.5s)]
*  And Charlotte, we mentioned this earlier. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1473.5s)]
*  Demi Moore has her first ever Oscar nomination, which I still cannot quite believe that she's never been nominated before. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1476.5s)]
*  And you know how much that will mean to her. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1484.5s)]
*  She's talked about how she wasn't taken seriously. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1487.5s)]
*  She was seen as a popcorn actress. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1489.5s)]
*  She could do the big blockbuster. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1491.5s)]
*  She could bring in the crowds, but she wasn't worthy of being rewarded for her performances. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1493.5s)]
*  And to get to her age now and to be coming back so strong, The Substance is a brilliant film as well. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1498.5s)]
*  It has so much to say about our obsession with youth and the entertainment industry and how it treats women. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1505.5s)]
*  I loved it. I mean, I made the mistake of going for dinner straight after watching the film. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1512.5s)]
*  I didn't quite expect it to be as gory as it was. But it's fantastic. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1516.5s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1521.5s)]
*  What did you make of Demi Moore, Rhiannon, the fact that she's been nominated and the film itself? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1523.5s)]
*  I'm so thrilled that she has. I kind of echo you. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1528.5s)]
*  Absolutely. I think she is. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1530.5s)]
*  I think it's one of the most interesting ones. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1532.5s)]
*  For example, I think baby girl Nicole Kidman. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1534.5s)]
*  The Oscars do kind of love Nicole Kidman. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1537.5s)]
*  Love her, yeah, absolutely. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1540.5s)]
*  And so I'm really glad that actually, as much as she's brilliant and baby girl, that she might have been edged out in favour of Demi Moore. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1541.5s)]
*  And I absolutely agree that it's such a... [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1548.5s)]
*  She's obviously going to have so much fun on this campaign as well. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1550.5s)]
*  And I can't wait to see kind of more of her interviews around this, because again, vital subject. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1552.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm interested, Helen. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1557.5s)]
*  Will the Academy go for someone who they think deserves something because of their whole career? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1559.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1565.5s)]
*  Versus say someone like Carla Sophia Gascon, who's in this one movie that is of the moment? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1566.5s)]
*  Well, there's a few kind of ways that you can help your Oscar chances. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1571.5s)]
*  One is to have a body of work that's never been rewarded. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1575.5s)]
*  So, you know, I'm thinking of like, I don't know, Jeff Bridges a few years ago. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1578.5s)]
*  It was a sense that it was his time. He hadn't had it yet. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1582.5s)]
*  That was an oversight on Oscar's part. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1584.5s)]
*  There's also the comeback story. Oscars love a comeback story. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1587.5s)]
*  And I think that's where Demi is in with a really good chance. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1590.5s)]
*  And honestly, she would be my choice, because I just think it's an extraordinary performance. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1593.5s)]
*  I think she's incredible in that film. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1596.5s)]
*  And then there is the breakthrough that just, you know, resets everyone's expectations. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1599.5s)]
*  And I guess that's where Carla would kind of qualify. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1603.5s)]
*  And also, like, Mikey Madsen for Enora would kind of be in there. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1606.5s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm really... I've got my fingers crossed for Demi, if I'm honest. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1610.5s)]
*  But yeah, it's a pretty strong lineup, I think, for best actors. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1614.5s)]
*  Charlotte, have you done your adding up yet? Do you know who's got the most? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1618.5s)]
*  It is. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1621.5s)]
*  Amelia Perez with 13. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1623.5s)]
*  So not quite the 14, but it would be a record break. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1626.5s)]
*  Yeah, so they've just... Yeah, they've not broken the record or equaled the record, but they're nearly there, aren't they? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1628.5s)]
*  Okay. Let's talk about best actor, because that to me seems like a very strong category, Helen. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1633.5s)]
*  I think that is. I mean, I think Adrian Brody and Sebastian Stan were both... I'm right, right? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1641.5s)]
*  They were both awarded at the Golden Globes, so they will probably be seen as the frontrunners. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1647.5s)]
*  But I genuinely don't think there's a weak performance in there. I think they're all extraordinary. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1651.5s)]
*  And I think Ray Fiennes is one of the greatest actors of this generation. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1656.5s)]
*  So it would be nice to see him, you know, pick one up, maybe. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1660.5s)]
*  And also, because Conclave, because it is a smaller, more internal role, it's not so showy. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1663.5s)]
*  So it would be really interesting to see if the Oscars are kind of more up for that sort of performance this time around. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1668.5s)]
*  But, Rhiannon, there's a lot of buzz around Timothee Chalamet and Bob Dylan in a complete unknown. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1673.5s)]
*  Absolutely. And to be honest, I would be kind of much more up for seeing it win in that category rather than perhaps for best director, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1679.5s)]
*  because I don't think the film is as strong in its directing as it is in its performances. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1685.5s)]
*  Timothee Chalamet is undoubtedly Bob Dylan in that. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1689.5s)]
*  And the way that he sings, I mean, the fact that he sings is huge and that he sings it so kind of so similarly, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1692.5s)]
*  I think is kind of going to edge out quite a lot of the competition. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1698.5s)]
*  And didn't he learn to play like four instruments or something for it? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1702.5s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't just a bit of let's pick up guitar. It was also let's pick up harmonica. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1704.5s)]
*  Let's pick up this and that. It's pretty impressive. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1708.5s)]
*  Sorry. No, no, I was going to say he's won over Bob Dylan fans as well. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1711.5s)]
*  Bob Dylan fans are loving it. And you can imagine if he hadn't have got it quite right, he would have been really criticized by them. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1714.5s)]
*  But I know somebody who went to see it and was in tears by the end of it. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1721.5s)]
*  And they're a lifelong Bob Dylan fan and people are really loving his performance. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1724.5s)]
*  Do you think for Ed Norton, though, winning, do you think that he's got a chance of winning best supporting actor? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1728.5s)]
*  I would love it if he did, because I thought he's such a positive, warm presence in that movie. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1734.5s)]
*  I just I really, really loved his energy. That said, that's another really strong category. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1739.5s)]
*  You know, I think there's a couple of people in there who are virtually leads. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1744.5s)]
*  I think Guy Pearce in The Brutalist is very hard to get past. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1747.5s)]
*  So that's another one that I see going down to the wire, to be honest. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1750.5s)]
*  OK, we only have 30 seconds. So who will win best film, Charlotte? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1754.5s)]
*  The substance. Rihanna. A complete unknown. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1758.5s)]
*  I think The Brutalist. OK, so completely different. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1762.5s)]
*  This is where if you are watching on the BBC News channel, you are going to leave us, but you can scan the QR code that you can see on the side of your screen at the moment, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1766.5s)]
*  because we are going to continue discussing. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZC2iVNheM&t=1775.5s)]
