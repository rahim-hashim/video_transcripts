Video Description: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has invited US President Donald Trump to visit his country ahead of any deal with Russia to end the war.
 
"Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead," Zelensky said in an interview for CBS's 60 Minutes programme.
 
The interview was recorded before a Russian missile on the Ukrainian city of Sumy killed 34 people, including two children, and injured 117 others.
 
Trump described the attack as a "horrible thing" while Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, accused Russia of committing a war crime.

# Volodymyr Zelensky urges Donald Trump to visit Ukraine ahead of deal with Russia | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA)
*  President Zelenskyy has urged Donald Trump to visit Ukraine to witness the devastation caused by Russia's invasion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of using clustered munitions to maximise casualties in its ballistic missile attack on the city of Sumy on Sunday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=11.0s)]
*  The Ukrainian president told CBS News that before there were any decisions or negotiations with Moscow, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=20.0s)]
*  President Trump should come and see for himself the devastation happening in Ukraine. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=26.0s)]
*  Let's speak to James Waterhouse who is in Sumy. James, welcome to you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=56.0s)]
*  I'm standing in the middle of two blast zones where two ballistic missiles slammed into Sumy yesterday. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=79.0s)]
*  These are the two blast zones that have been hit by the Russian military. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=86.0s)]
*  It seems like rescue crews are clearing up the endless debris. There is shattered glass everywhere. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=94.0s)]
*  And I'm standing in the middle of two blast zones where two ballistic missiles slammed into Sumy yesterday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=100.0s)]
*  These are several historic university buildings which have been pretty much destroyed from both impacts. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=107.0s)]
*  The site here 24 hours ago was one of deep devastation. Bodies were strewn everywhere reflecting the civilian casualty pile from such an attack. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=117.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was asked about this attack. He described it as a horrible thing. He even suggested that Russia may have made a mistake. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=130.0s)]
*  I think when you're talking about ballistic missiles launched at a Ukrainian city on a bustling Sunday morning, it is clear Moscow wanted to inflict heavy casualties. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=138.0s)]
*  In the past, it talks about a military dimension to its strikes. And even if that was so, even if there was a gathering of soldiers, for example, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=148.0s)]
*  this is seen as acceptable collateral for Russia. It always has been. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=158.0s)]
*  President Zelensky is trying to bridge a widening gap between an America which is trying to spearhead ceasefire talks still and Russia looking to capitalize on that endeavor. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=163.0s)]
*  You are not seeing the White House after this attack condemn Russia for the missile strikes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=175.0s)]
*  I think President Zelensky now is trying to use moments like this to convince American officials to come and see the realities of Russia's invasion for themselves. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=180.0s)]
*  He is also reiterating his argument that if the West does not take a strong stance against Russia in these ceasefire endeavors, then Moscow won't stop here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=192.0s)]
*  It will then go for other European countries, possibly NATO countries, to, in the words of President Zelensky, restore the lost Russian empire. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=204.0s)]
*  You can see the strategy President Zelensky is using here, but it is a high-risk one because in the past, when he has taken a defiant tone, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=214.0s)]
*  that has angled Donald Trump to the extent that he has paused military aid for Ukraine. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=221.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, this against the backdrop of continued air strikes against cities like Sumy, which are 30 kilometers from the border, this has been an attack which very much has stood out from the rest. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=226.0s)]
*  James, we heard President Zelensky again reiterate his invitation to President Trump, asking him to come and see for himself what is happening in Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=238.0s)]
*  We know that the former President Joe Biden did visit Ukraine after the Russian invasion started. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=246.0s)]
*  How likely is it, do you think, that the current US President could go there himself? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=251.0s)]
*  I think it is 50-50 at this point. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=258.0s)]
*  Donald Trump said when they first met, Zelensky and Trump, last September, that he would visit Ukraine. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=260.0s)]
*  He has since suggested that he wouldn't be coming any time soon. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=265.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the senior US envoy, Steve Whitcoff, has had three meetings with Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=269.0s)]
*  He was in St Petersburg last Friday, where they warmly met each other. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=275.0s)]
*  And concerningly for Ukraine, it was where the Kremlin has repeated its demands for how this war should end. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=279.0s)]
*  It is making no concessions. It still wants the complete control of four Ukrainian provinces and the political capitulation of Ukraine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=286.0s)]
*  There is no climbing down from there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=293.0s)]
*  So Ukraine is in this impossible position of having to mimic or mirror America's desire, its impatience for peace, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=296.0s)]
*  but also to try and protect its interests and defend itself. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=304.0s)]
*  As Russia, certainly in this part of northeastern Ukraine, seemingly tries to continue to try and soften cities, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=308.0s)]
*  and in the eyes of Kiev, gather thousands of troops to try and mount a major offensive of some kind, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=314.0s)]
*  not least with the improving of this weather for battlefield conditions. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=321.0s)]
*  So Ukraine is playing this juggling act, whilst America seems to try and continue its quest for peace [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=325.0s)]
*  by appeasing Russia and trying to keep it at the table and not condemning it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=332.0s)]
*  Okay, James, in sumi, thank you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRjJTEU4MiA&t=336.0s)]
