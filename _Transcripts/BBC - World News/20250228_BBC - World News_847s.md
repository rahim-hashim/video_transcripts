*  he said to President Zelensky, when we're talking about security that's the easy part, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=61.88s)]
*  he said which means we're at a ceasefire and we're at peace and President Zelensky said [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=66.8s)]

*  tape for you now, we can bring it to you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=95.64s)]
*  What's your message for them? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  Well if I didn't align myself with both of them you'd never have a deal, you want me [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=102.12s)]
*  to say really terrible things about Putin and then say hi Vladimir how are we doing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  on the deal, that doesn't work that way, I'm not aligned with Putin, I'm not aligned with [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=113.28s)]
*  anybody I'm aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=117.6s)]
*  I'm aligned with the world and I want to get this thing over with you see the hatred he's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  got for Putin that's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hatred, he's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=126.94s)]
*  got tremendous hatred and I understand that but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=130.44s)]
*  in love with you know him either so it's not a question of alignment I have to I'm [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=135.68s)]
*  aligned with the world I want to get the thing set I'm aligned with Europe I want to see [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=142.44s)]
*  if we can get this thing done you want me to be tough I could be tougher than any human [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  being you've ever seen I'd be so tough but you're never going to get a deal that way [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=153.6s)]
*  so that's the way it goes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=158.16s)]
*  One more question. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=160.16s)]
*  I want to respond to this so look for four years in the United States of America we had [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=161.16s)]
*  a president who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=166.4s)]
*  then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=171.12s)]
*  The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=175.76s)]
*  We tried the pathway of Joe Biden of thumping our chest and pretending that the president [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=182.0s)]
*  of the United States' words mattered more than the president of the United States' [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=187.72s)]
*  actions. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=191.84s)]
*  What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=192.9s)]
*  That's what President Trump is doing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=197.08s)]
*  Can I ask you? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=198.6s)]

*  Okay. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  So he occupied our parts, big parts of Ukraine, parts of East and Crimea. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  So he occupied it on 2014. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  So during a lot of years, I'm not speaking about just Biden but those times was Obama [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=215.4s)]
*  then President Obama then President Trump then President Biden now President Trump and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=222.88s)]
*  God bless now President Trump will stop him but during 2014 nobody stopped him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=228.52s)]
*  He just occupied and took. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=234.07999999999998s)]

*  Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I'd tell you, you take it so the bullets stop [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=536.9000000000001s)]
*  flying and your men stop getting killed. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=541.74s)]
*  Of course we want to stop the war. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=543.74s)]
*  But you're saying you don't want to cease fire. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=545.34s)]
*  But I said to you, I want to cease fire. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=546.34s)]
*  With guarantees. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=548.14s)]
*  Because you'll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=549.14s)]
*  Ask our people about ceasefire. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=551.22s)]
*  What they think. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=553.02s)]

*  That was with a guy named Biden who was not a smart person. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=557.02s)]
*  That was with Obama. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=561.34s)]
*  It was your president. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=563.3s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=564.3s)]
*  That was with Obama who gave you sheets and I gave you javelins. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=565.3s)]
*  I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=568.5s)]
*  Obama gave you sheets. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=572.3s)]
*  In fact, the statement is Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=574.3s)]
*  You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=579.8599999999999s)]

*  One more question to Mr. Vice President. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=588.3399999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=591.3399999999999s)]
*  It's going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=592.3399999999999s)]
*  What if Russia breaks this fire? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=596.3399999999999s)]
*  What if Russia breaks these talks? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=599.3399999999999s)]

*  What if they, what if anything? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=609.38s)]
*  What if a bomb drops on your head right now? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=611.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=614.38s)]
*  What if they broke it? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=615.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=616.38s)]
*  They broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn't respect him. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=617.38s)]
*  They didn't respect Obama. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=620.38s)]
*  They respect me. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=621.38s)]
*  Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=624.38s)]
*  He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=626.38s)]

*  You ever hear of that deal? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=632.42s)]

*  And he had to go through that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=643.42s)]
*  And he did go through it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=645.42s)]
*  We didn't end up in a war. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=646.42s)]

*  He was accused of all that stuff. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=649.42s)]

*  It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=655.42s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=658.42s)]
*  And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=659.4599999999999s)]

*  And you have seen the extremely tense and difficult exchanges [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=771.62s)]
*  between JD Vance, Donald Trump and President Zelensky. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=775.62s)]

*  compromises with Putin. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0q31cfEIQ&t=804.66s)]
