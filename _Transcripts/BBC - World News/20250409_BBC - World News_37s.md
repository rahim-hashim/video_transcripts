# Scan of Titanic wreck reveals new insight into ship' final hours. #Titanic #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaF1q-nlN38)
*  Did the Titanic's engineers stay on the sinking ship to keep the lights on and help the crew launch lifeboats? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaF1q-nlN38&t=0.0s)]
*  An exact 3D replica of the wreck, mapped by underwater robots, suggests so. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaF1q-nlN38&t=5.16s)]
*  It's the subject of a documentary made by Atlantic Productions and National Geographic. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaF1q-nlN38&t=9.36s)]
*  In this section here, you can see that some of the boilers are concave, suggesting they were still operating when they plunged into the water, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaF1q-nlN38&t=13.68s)]
*  and on the deck of the stern, a valve in the open position, suggesting steam was still flowing and generating electricity when the ship sank. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaF1q-nlN38&t=19.8s)]
*  This matches eyewitness accounts of the bravery of a team of engineers, led by Joseph Bell, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaF1q-nlN38&t=26.72s)]
*  who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces and help people get off the boat. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaF1q-nlN38&t=31.12s)]
*  All of the engineers died in the disaster. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaF1q-nlN38&t=34.84s)]
