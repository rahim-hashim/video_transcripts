Video Description: Friedrich Merz's conservatives have won Germany's election, well ahead of rival parties but short of the 30% vote-share they had expected.
 
"Let's celebrate tonight and in the morning, we'll get to work," he told cheering supporters. His immediate priority is to try to form a government with the third-placed Social Democrats of Olaf Scholz.
 
Even before the result was clear, Merz said his top priority was unity in Europe, so that "step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US".
 
The other big winner in Sunday's vote was the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), who are celebrating a record second-place result of 20.8%.

# Germany's conservatives celebrate, as far-right enjoy record result | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk)
*  To Germany now and the Conservatives are celebrating winning the country's election the results also saw large gains for the far-right party [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=0.0s)]
*  Alternative for Germany or AFD. Let's go live to my colleague. So me some of the scanner who is in Berlin. Good morning, so me [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=8.0s)]
*  Good morning, Nikki [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=16.88s)]
*  It's been a pretty short night here as you can imagine for Germany's political parties after this consequential election [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=17.96s)]
*  And there was of course vote counting still taking place late into the night [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=24.18s)]
*  And there were some important developments overnight as well that we should say [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=28.259999999999998s)]
*  You know a lot of our viewers will not be familiar with the smaller parties here in Germany [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=32.18s)]
*  But there was one the BSW which is a pro-russia party where there was vote counting happening into the night [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=36.739999999999995s)]
*  And at the end they did not make it into Parliament and the reason that matters is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=42.86s)]
*  It means that the Christian Democrats led by Friedrich Merz who came out the biggest party and the Social Democrats [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=47.66s)]
*  Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party now do have a big enough majority to form a coalition [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=53.66s)]
*  So that is for them [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=59.22s)]
*  Of course a bit of good news because they wanted to or Friedrich Merz wanted to form a two-party coalition [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=60.66s)]
*  But the work still lies ahead [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=66.5s)]
*  We have heard from German leaders on the morning talk shows here saying that they are holding talks with their own party with the party [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  Leadership today. We're seeing the Social Democrats giving a press conference this afternoon [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=75.38s)]
*  So we can hear a bit more from them about what they expect from possible coalition talks [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=80.10000000000001s)]
*  The other big story is of course the far-right AFD. They've been holding a news conference [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=84.62s)]
*  I think we have some live pictures of that that we can show as well. They have again been [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=89.58s)]
*  Victorious this morning on the morning talk shows here in Germany saying that their result after the late-night vote counting got them above [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=94.42s)]
*  20% again a doubling of their previous election result [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  They say that is proof that German voters don't see them as extremists as fascists [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=105.26s)]
*  But rather as a party that is tackling the issues that voters want to see tackled namely [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=111.18s)]
*  Migration first and foremost and then the economy [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=117.14s)]
*  but if we come back to the Christian Democrats and a chancellor or that's soon to be likely Chancellor Friedrich Merz [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  He's expected to become the country's next Chancellor again having won the biggest share of the vote and he's called for a coalition government [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=126.34s)]
*  To be formed very quickly. The reason for that we know of course is because of the war in Ukraine [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=134.52s)]
*  It's three-year anniversary today, of course and Chancellor Merz a big supporter of Ukraine and he said his top priority will be supporting [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=140.52s)]
*  Unity in Europe, which he said is needed to achieve [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=149.12s)]
*  Independence from the United States really strong words there from fetish Matt's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=152.12s)]
*  Let's take a look at the preliminary results now fetish Matt's is conservative as you see in black here [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=156.36s)]
*  They were ahead of rival parties, but just below 30% of the vote sure that they had expected [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=162.56s)]
*  We mentioned of course the other winner the far-right alternative for Germany celebrating that second place result of twenty point eight percent [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=169.08s)]
*  And then the Social Democrats led by the current Chancellor Olaf Schultz you see in red [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  They got their worst result ever with sixteen point four percent [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  That's a drop of about nine percentage points from the last election [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  And this is really interesting if you look at a map of where these votes were distributed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=188.52s)]
*  You can see that in the former east of Germany the AFD this blue color [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=192.72s)]
*  Dominated really dominated that entire region the West [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=197.88s)]
*  Overwhelmingly went for the CDU you see in black on the map. So really interesting voting patterns now over in the US President Trump [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=202.32s)]
*  Welcomed the CDU's victory saying it was proof that Germans were like Americans [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=210.52s)]
*  Americans tired of the quote no common-sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=214.56s)]
*  So those are the results that we've been looking at our Berlin correspondent Jessica Parker has more on how the night unfolded [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=220.8s)]
*  The man now set to lead Germany the center-right politician told his supporters that he understood the enormity of the task now before him [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=230.56s)]
*  I know about the dimension of the task meanwhile flags were waving at the AFD election base [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=239.2s)]
*  The far-right party came second its best-ever result [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=249.16s)]
*  They won't get into government as other parties won't work with them, but they say they're on the road to power [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=252.72s)]
*  Here at the election night HQ of the center-right [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  CDU party the beer is flowing so is the German sparkling wine, but [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=264.72s)]
*  I've been speaking to you so they are a bit disappointed about the results [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=269.76s)]
*  They'd hope to do a little better. Nevertheless, this is the party that is in pole position to form the next government [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=273.86s)]
*  What priorities? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=281.48s)]
*  Does the next German government have to deliver on I think the most important thing is migration than economics, but also [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=283.64s)]
*  Internationally there we have to figure out this situation with Ukraine, especially. We're now with Donald Trump in the government and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=291.48s)]
*  On American relations Friedrich Merz gave this stark assessment [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=299.48s)]
*  After Trump's statements last week, it is absolutely clear that this US government doesn't care about Europe [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=306.72s)]
*  For now though. It's time to build bridges at home [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=314.96s)]
*  Pulling together a governing coalition in Germany never an easy task Jessica Parker BBC News in Berlin [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=318.56s)]
*  Well as we've been hearing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=328.6s)]
*  Fiddich met the leader of the Christian Democrats again [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=330.24s)]
*  The likely next Chancellor has been talking also about the urgency of needing to form a government as quickly as possible [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  And in fact, you know some of the parties who will be in the opposition the Greens for example [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=339.04s)]
*  Agree that Germany must have a government in place very soon the reason for that, of course [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=343.56s)]
*  Europe needing leadership on issues like the war in Ukraine [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=349.64s)]
*  Also the relationship with the US and I just want to again highlight what we heard from fetish mats on the US [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=352.48s)]
*  He said I have no illusions about what is happening in America [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=358.08s)]
*  Intervention from Washington and by intervention. He's talking about for example, Elon Musk [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=363.16s)]
*  Hosting an event with Alice vital the head of the far right on Twitter [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=368.28s)]
*  He said that was not any less brazen and drastic than what comes out of Moscow [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=371.84s)]
*  So an extremely strong message there and also a message to the Europeans [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=377.96s)]
*  He said his government will ensure that Europe can achieve full strategic independence from the US in its defense against Russia [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=381.64s)]
*  So clearly a call to his European partners also in the UK [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=389.44s)]
*  Looking to the war in Ukraine and how to build consensus around defense against Russian aggression [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  Really interesting moment here in Germany one that will be watched of course across Europe and also in the US [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubkU1uMOXk&t=401.12s)]
