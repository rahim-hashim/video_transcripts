Video Description: India has accused Pakistan of using missiles to target its bases, hours after Pakistan accused India of firing at three of its military airbases.
 
Indian Air Force's Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said Pakistan carried out "aggressive actions employing multiple threat vectors" around India's western border.
 
Pakistan's army claimed to have destroyed India's S-400 defence systems.
 
However, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Singh both deny that Pakistani strikes have caused any damage to military infrastructure in India.
 
Earlier this week, India struck targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - Islamabad has denied involvement.

# India and Pakistan accuse each other of firing missiles at airbases | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM)
*  Pakistan says it is retaliating after accusing India of striking three of its air bases overnight, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=0.0s)]
*  including one close to the capital Islamabad. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=6.8s)]
*  Both countries have blamed each other for the violence since militants killed Indian [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=10.08s)]
*  tourists last month in Indian-administered Kashmir. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Pakistan has denied any involvement. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=17.52s)]
*  At least 50 people have been killed since the fighting escalated on Wednesday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=20.0s)]
*  The G7 Group of the world's top industrial nations has called for an immediate de-escalation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  and direct dialogue between the two countries. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=29.58s)]
*  Last month's militant killing of 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=33.14s)]
*  the worst fighting between India and Pakistan in decades. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=37.48s)]
*  Let's speak to our correspondent Aruna Day Mukherjee who is in Delhi for us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=41.78s)]
*  Welcome to you Aruna Day. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=45.3s)]
*  There has been a press conference from the Indian authorities and military in the past [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=46.3s)]
*  half hour or so. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=51.86s)]
*  What is the latest from them? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=52.86s)]
*  In fact I was at that press briefing that took place just behind me in that building [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=59.46s)]
*  where the Indian Foreign Secretary Mr. Vikram Mishri addressed the press along with two [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=63.1s)]
*  senior officials of both the Indian Army as well as the Indian Air Force, the same team [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=67.7s)]
*  that has been briefing the press since the developments began. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  Now at the outset India reiterated that whatever India has been doing has been in response [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=74.86s)]
*  and it is Pakistan they accused of resorting to provocative and escalatory measures. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=80.12s)]
*  So the Indian press conference started on that tone essentially saying that Pakistan [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=86.7s)]
*  had attempted to violate Indian airspace using high-speed missiles, long-range weapons, drones [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=91.22s)]
*  and other munitions to target sensitive Indian military installations in multiple cities. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=96.84s)]
*  The Indian authorities also pointed out that they had successfully managed to thwart those [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=102.82s)]
*  advances but they also said that there had been limited damage reported at some of its [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=108.5s)]
*  military installations. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  They also followed up what they said with pictures that they broadcast during that press [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=114.38s)]
*  conference with time stamps to suggest that these pictures were latest pictures and they [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=118.24s)]
*  wanted to impress upon the fact that business was as usual when it came to these sensitive [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=123.46s)]
*  air bases and other military installations. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=129.1s)]
*  They also accused Pakistan of continuing to resort to heavy ceasefire violations along [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=131.26s)]
*  the de facto border dividing Indian and Pakistani administered Kashmir that we call the Line [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=135.54s)]
*  of Control which is recognized internationally. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=140.1s)]
*  They said that they resorted to heavy shelling which also was targeting some civilian areas [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=142.36s)]
*  especially in a forward town called Rajouri in the Indian administered Kashmir region. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=148.10000000000002s)]
*  In that they said that one senior Indian government official had lost his life. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  What the Indian side also impressed upon in that press conference accusing Pakistan of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=160.58s)]
*  not just targeting military installations in India but also attempting to target civilian [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=166.12s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=171.8s)]
*  They repeated that multiple times in that press conference as they communicated it to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=172.8s)]
*  the media that this was absolutely unacceptable and accused Pakistan of resorting to these [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=177.4s)]
*  kind of means. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=183.84s)]
*  They also confirmed that because of the targeting of civilian infrastructure, civilians had [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=184.84s)]
*  also sustained significant injuries as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=189.6s)]
*  The situation at the moment remains calm. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=192.28s)]
*  Both countries accusing each other of missile attacks. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=194.52s)]
*  Both countries accusing each other of adopting escalatory methods. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=196.84s)]
*  Meanwhile we're seeing increasing calls for de-escalation from the US Secretary of State [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=200.96s)]
*  Marco Rubio who was offered to be a bridge between the two countries as well and China [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=205.16s)]
*  as well so the international community is sensing some urgency here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely because look Samantha we're entering into uncharted territory in many ways. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=220.4s)]
*  This is a new phase of the escalation of the situation between India and Pakistan with [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  both countries start accusing each other of missile strikes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  So far we've been talking about drones, we've been talking about artillery fire along the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=233.04s)]
*  de facto border between India and Pakistan, the administered Kashmir. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=237.4s)]
*  But as soon as you bring in issues like missiles being fired at each other to nuclear armed [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=240.68s)]
*  neighbors well that certainly is a big cause for concern and to draw international attention. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=245.68s)]
*  What we do know at the moment is the Secretary of State in the US, Mr. Marco Rubio, has had [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  conversations with both sides. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=255.3s)]
*  But I can tell you about the conversation with Mr. S.J. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Shankar who happens to be the Indian foreign minister. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=259.64s)]
*  He said that look both sides need to sit together and find ways to de-escalate, find methods [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=263.76s)]
*  to de-escalate the situation at the earliest. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=268.86s)]
*  He also said the US was willing to play a proactive role in facilitating these kind [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=271.48s)]
*  of meetings if the countries would wish that to happen. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  But again as we see these allegations and counter allegations many experts are wondering [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=279.72s)]
*  How much of a window is there for any kind of de-escalation through diplomatic means? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  Arunajay Mukherjee and Delhi, thank you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=288.32000000000005s)]
*  Well our reporter Davina is in Srinagar where explosions were heard. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  Let's hear from her. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  We are in central Srinagar and usually at this point of time at 8am local time we have [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=298.88000000000005s)]
*  a lot of traffic here but right now the city is on the edge because at 5.45am local time [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=305.48s)]
*  we heard two explosions and they were powerful enough to shake the building of our hotel. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=314.02s)]
*  Just 30 minutes later we also heard three more explosions. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=320.46s)]
*  Two eye witnesses have confirmed to the BBC who live near the city's airport that they [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=325.54s)]
*  heard the sound of what they described as a jet flying over and then there was a loud [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=331.42s)]
*  explosion at that airport. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=338.68s)]
*  We don't know what was targeted. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  We don't have any confirmation right now from official sources. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=343.06s)]
*  We were expecting an army briefing in the capital city of Delhi at 5.45am in the morning [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=347.26000000000005s)]
*  but that has been shifted to later in the day. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=354.26000000000005s)]
*  Overnight the city was plunged into darkness because there was a blackout, electricity [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  was switched off, it hasn't come back and we have seen this even yesterday. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  We also heard reports of drones and attacks at the border area, the line of control that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=370.02s)]
*  divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=376.9s)]
*  We can confirm that at least three locations there have been targeted and has been in the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=380.62s)]
*  intense crossfire and shelling that have been reported there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=387.14s)]
*  For now, at least in Srinagar, the situation is tense and we are waiting to see what happens [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=392.3s)]
*  during the day and get some more official information. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=398.58s)]
*  Earlier I was joined by Hussein Haqqani, a former Pakistan ambassador to the US and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=404.58s)]
*  he gave us his analysis on the tensions between the two nations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=409.34s)]
*  The last four days there has been an escalation despite the fact that both India and Pakistan [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=413.78s)]
*  keep saying that they do not want escalation. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=418.58s)]
*  It seems that both sides want to have the last word. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=421.74s)]
*  The terrorist attack of April 22nd was something that disturbed the Indians, legitimately so. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=426.14s)]
*  They felt that they have been having many terrorist attacks for the last three decades [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=432.86s)]
*  and they need to do something about it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=436.98s)]
*  When they did something about it, it was not the end. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=439.18s)]
*  Now Pakistan wanted to retaliate to that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=442.26s)]
*  In between we've had drone and missile exchanges that have definitely been escalatory in nature [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=445.56s)]
*  and the traditional pattern that these two siblings born on the same day in 1947 as independent [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=452.38s)]
*  countries keep fighting and America comes as nanny to stop them from fighting didn't [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=460.14s)]
*  actually hold. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=465.42s)]
*  Hopefully now President Trump has decided that he is not going to have this hands-off [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=466.65999999999997s)]
*  attitude and that might bring some sense to the table. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=473.86s)]
*  Yes, I mentioned a moment ago that Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, had offered US [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=478.78s)]
*  support to start constructive talks. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=483.18s)]
*  What's your sense of whether that offer will be taken up then? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=486.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, hopefully it will be taken up and it will de-escalate the current situation. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=490.78s)]
*  But if anybody is expecting a resolution of the problem, that's not going to happen. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=495.97999999999996s)]
*  India says that the real issue is Pakistani-sponsored and Pakistani-supported terrorism and it cites [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=502.29999999999995s)]
*  a string of attacks that have taken place both in India and in Jammu and Kashmir over [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=508.34s)]
*  the years for which it holds Pakistan responsible. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=514.3399999999999s)]
*  Pakistan's response is that India also has an internal problem and some of these attacks [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=517.86s)]
*  are because of that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=522.02s)]
*  For example, this latest attack was very far from the Pakistani border and so far India [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=523.02s)]
*  has not been able to find the people who are responsible for it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=528.9s)]
*  So India has a problem that it must address itself. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=532.26s)]
*  In the middle of it all is the concern about nuclear weapons. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=537.26s)]
*  The world doesn't want these two countries to fight and reach a point where either of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=541.4799999999999s)]
*  them is compelled to use nuclear weapons. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=546.88s)]
*  Will there be talks that will satisfy both sides, India's concerns about terrorism and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=549.4799999999999s)]
*  Pakistan's concerns about the resolution of the Kashmir dispute that has been unresolved [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=556.24s)]
*  since 1947? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=560.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbYsHrU47rM&t=562.38s)]
