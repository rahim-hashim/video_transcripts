Video Description: A curfew is in place for a second night in Los Angeles after nearly a week of unrest in the city over US immigration raids.
 
Multiple people were arrested for violating the downtown curfew shortly after it came into effect at 20:00 local time on Wednesday (03:00 GMT on Thursday).
 
Nearly 400 people have been arrested in LA since protests began on Friday, including 330 undocumented migrants and 157 people arrested for assault and obstruction, including one for the attempted murder of a police officer.
 
Federal prosecutors have so far charged two men for throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers in two separate incidents.
