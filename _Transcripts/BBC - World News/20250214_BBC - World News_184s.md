# Donald Trump wants peace but Ukrainians fear what that might look like | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk)
*  The sounds and scars of Russia's invasion. Reminders of war weigh heavy here. The destruction [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=0.0s)]
*  of a major dam drained this reservoir. A static front line has put life on hold. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=12.64s)]
*  Dmytro used to fish these waters. Now he waits for Donald Trump's vision for peace. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=24.76s)]
*  If it stays like this, as it is now, then nothing will work out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  It will just be a border. Most likely it will be impossible to live next to the Russians, unfortunately. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=35.96s)]
*  America's big plan is a body blow for Ukraine. It dared to dream that three years of sacrifice [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=42.2s)]
*  and Western support would make it safe from Russia. Now it feels vulnerable and betrayed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=56.68000000000001s)]
*  The loss of this water has reshaped Ukraine. It separates where we are from [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=64.76s)]
*  Russian occupied territory and any ceasefire would freeze this as a fault line. And what Ukraine [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=71.16s)]
*  wants is a guarantee that it would be able to stop Russia from crossing it in the future. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=78.44s)]
*  Villagers now rely on this well, fresh water, forced to adapt. Their president claims Russia [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=87.32s)]
*  can still be pressured, but at the moment it is Ukrainians like Anatoly who are feeling the heat. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=93.96s)]
*  I would like the war to be over, the world to help us, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=101.24s)]
*  America and Europe, so that we could stay strong and have lasting peace. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=109.88s)]
*  With all the talk about talks, Ukrainians are still fighting and dying. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=118.84s)]
*  Funerals are constant. Here it is the turn of Natalia's husband, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=125.88s)]
*  a local soldier called Alexander, to be laid to rest. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=131.4s)]
*  Honestly, I just don't know anymore. They keep sending more and more of our guys to the front line. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  I wish they found some way to end it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=145.0s)]
*  Donald Trump says he wants the killing to stop. Ukrainians know the cost of Russia's invasion. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=156.28s)]
*  Even when it ends, they will be paying the price for generations. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idwUrNiUBzk&t=170.92s)]
