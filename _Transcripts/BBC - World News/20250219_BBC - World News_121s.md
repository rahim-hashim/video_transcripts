Video Description: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told EU leaders in Paris that he would consider deploying UK troops to Ukraine in the event of a lasting peace agreement.
 
Meanwhile, the US and Russia have been holding talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at ending the war, but Ukraine was not invited.
 
A full-scale Russian invasion sparked the war in Ukraine almost three years ago, eight years after it unilaterally annexed Crimea.
 
The BBCâ€™s Analysis Editor Ros Atkins has been looking at what that would mean.

# Would the UK send troops to Ukraine? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc)
*  If British troops were to help maintain a peace deal in Ukraine, what would that involve? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukraine's President Zelensky says, I have a map that shows 110,000 foreigners. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=6.0s)]
*  One former head of the military alliance, NATO, estimates a force of between 50 and 100,000. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=12.0s)]
*  Whatever the number, it would be substantial. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=18.0s)]
*  And it's not clear which European countries would send troops. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=21.0s)]
*  Poland indicates it wouldn't. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=25.0s)]
*  Germany says the question is completely premature. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=27.0s)]
*  France has previously said we do not discard any option. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=30.0s)]
*  And while the UK is willing, the numbers look difficult. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=34.0s)]
*  Britain has 75,000 full-time army personnel plus 24,000 army reserves. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=38.0s)]
*  That includes many non-combat roles. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=44.0s)]
*  Across the UK's military, personnel are already involved in supporting 60 operations in 44 countries. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=47.0s)]
*  A deployment in Ukraine could dwarf these commitments. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=54.0s)]
*  And that may not be realistic. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=58.0s)]
*  Frankly, we haven't got the numbers and we haven't got the equipment to put a large force onto the ground for an extended period of time at the present moment. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=60.0s)]
*  In the 90s, British troops were part of a UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=68.0s)]
*  In the early 2000s, they supported a UN force in Sierra Leone. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=72.0s)]
*  But what's being considered in Ukraine is very different. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=77.0s)]
*  It would be much bigger. It wouldn't be a UN mission or a NATO mission either. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=81.0s)]
*  The US defence secretary is clear. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=86.0s)]
*  Any force won't be protected by NATO's principle of collective defence. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=89.0s)]
*  And then there's Russia. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=94.0s)]
*  It says the appearance of troops from NATO countries in Ukraine as part of any peace deal is completely unacceptable. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=96.0s)]
*  Put all of this together, and in practice, the prime minister's proposal would mean significantly expanding the UK's military and a willingness, if need be, to militarily engage Russia or its proxies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=103.0s)]
*  It's an acknowledgement of how much has changed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMl_wQu-lTc&t=116.0s)]
