Video Description: As Venezuela’s oil industry has plummeted with sanctions and economic collapse, President Nicolas Maduro has turned to his country’s other mineral wealth: gold.
He’s used it to win allies and raise money. But the US, which has urged Mr Maduro to stand down, has warned those profiting from what it calls Venezuela’s illegitimate gold trade.
The BBC's Mark Lowen takes a look at Venezuela's gold diplomacy gamble.

# Venezuela's gold diplomacy gamble - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 09, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0)
*  This man needs friends. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=0.0s)]
*  Nicolas Maduro is clinging on in Venezuela, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=3.0s)]
*  but Western powers back his rival Juan Guaido. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=6.0s)]
*  But he's still got something valuable to keep some countries on side. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=9.0s)]
*  This stuff. Gold. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=15.0s)]
*  With the Venezuelan oil industry hit by sanctions, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=18.0s)]
*  Mr Maduro has had to turn to the country's mineral wealth [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=22.0s)]
*  to raise cash and make friends. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=26.0s)]
*  Venezuela wanted to withdraw $1.2 billion of its gold [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=29.0s)]
*  stored at the Bank of England. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=35.0s)]
*  Ka-ching! [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=37.0s)]
*  But the bank said, uh-uh. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=38.0s)]
*  President Maduro's number two wasn't happy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=40.0s)]
*  He roared, the English have stolen the gold. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=42.0s)]
*  The imperialist bosses should know we'll never give up. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=45.0s)]
*  So Venezuela has had to look elsewhere, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=48.0s)]
*  and its new biggest buddies are also, conveniently, its biggest gold buyers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=51.0s)]
*  Turkey, Russia and the United Arab Emirates [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=57.0s)]
*  are standing behind Nicolas Maduro. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=61.0s)]
*  President Erdogan has built a close relationship with him, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=64.0s)]
*  telling him, stand tall, brother, Turkey's with you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=67.0s)]
*  Now look at the gold numbers. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=71.0s)]
*  Last year, Venezuela exported about $900 million of gold to Turkey. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=73.0s)]
*  Venezuela's opposition claimed recently that Russia was preparing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=80.0s)]
*  to buy $840 million worth with cash brought back in Russian jets [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=84.0s)]
*  landing in Caracas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=90.0s)]
*  And after reports that the UAE was about to buy 15 tons of gold, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=92.0s)]
*  a company in Abu Dhabi said they'd bought three tons [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=97.0s)]
*  and would leave it at that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=101.0s)]
*  So why the big concern? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=104.0s)]
*  Two words, conditions and Iran. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=106.0s)]
*  The mining conditions are awful. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=109.0s)]
*  The pits are being contaminated with liquid mercury, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=111.0s)]
*  causing massive ecological damage. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=114.0s)]
*  Big pro-Maduro guys are running violent gangs, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=117.0s)]
*  exploiting the miners with reports of massacres. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=121.0s)]
*  It's being called by some, blood gold. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=124.0s)]
*  The US suspects that some of it going to Turkey [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=127.0s)]
*  is actually ending up in Iran, which would violate sanctions. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=130.0s)]
*  The Turkish government says that's absolutely not happening. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=134.0s)]
*  But I've been told that Turkey is now by far the biggest concern [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=137.0s)]
*  of all the countries engaging in the gold trade. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=142.0s)]
*  The US National Security Advisor John Bolton warned those dealing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=147.0s)]
*  in gold and oil being, as he put it, stolen by the Maduro mafia [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=151.0s)]
*  that action could be taken. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=156.0s)]
*  I've been told the Turkish authorities have been made aware [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=159.0s)]
*  they're on thin ice. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=162.0s)]
*  Venezuela's thought to have about $8 billion left in its gold reserves. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=164.0s)]
*  Those backing the opposition hope that by starving the government [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=169.0s)]
*  of more sales, they might just remove one of the last big cards [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=173.0s)]
*  Nicolas Maduro has to play. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP4B-JuMgS0&t=177.0s)]
