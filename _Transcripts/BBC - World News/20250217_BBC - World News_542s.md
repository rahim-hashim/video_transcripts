# European leaders meet for crisis summit on Ukraine war | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw)
*  European leaders will meet in Paris today for a crisis summit on Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's in response to President Trump's plan to negotiate an end to the war directly with Russia. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  News that Europe and Ukraine would be excluded from talks this week in Saudi Arabia [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=10.16s)]
*  has been met with anger and disbelief. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=15.16s)]
*  Jo Inwood reports. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=17.72s)]
*  The question is increasingly being asked. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=20.2s)]
*  If there is to be peace in Ukraine, what price must be paid? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=22.68s)]
*  The common position has always been this, as expressed by Oleksandr in Kiev. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=27.12s)]
*  I would like us to get back all our territories, he says. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=33.6s)]
*  But is it possible? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=36.68s)]
*  I can't say at this stage. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=38.28s)]
*  I have faith and hope in it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=40.16s)]
*  I think everyone wants this to happen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=41.88s)]
*  The last few days at the Munich Security Conference have shattered that belief. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  First, the new US defence secretary said Ukraine would have to give up territory [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=51.28s)]
*  and its ambitions to join NATO. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=56.28s)]
*  The reality of Ukraine membership in NATO as a part of a negotiated settlement, unlikely. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=58.36s)]
*  Then it was announced that President Trump had a 90-minute phone conversation with President Putin [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=67.16s)]
*  before speaking to his Ukrainian ally. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=72.16s)]
*  I had a good conversation with President Trump. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=75.2s)]
*  We had some phone calls and he had a phone call with Putin. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=77.84s)]
*  And he said to me, I think that Putin, that he wants to stop the war. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=81.72s)]
*  I said to him that he is a liar. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=86.88s)]
*  And then the news that talks will be held in Saudi Arabia to find a way to end the war. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  This was the response of the US special envoy when asked if Europe, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=94.6s)]
*  which has provided more support for Ukraine than the states, should be at the table. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=98.24s)]
*  Can you assure this audience that Ukrainians will be at the table [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=103.08s)]
*  and Europeans will be at the table? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  The answer to that last question, just as you framed it, the answer is no. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=110.32s)]
*  The answer to the earlier part of that question is yes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=114.63999999999999s)]
*  Of course the Ukrainians are going to be at the table. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=116.8s)]
*  It's put Europe in a difficult position, which risks it being excluded from the key decisions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=119.08s)]
*  That will undoubtedly be under discussion at the emergency summit in Paris, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=125.44s)]
*  convened by President Macron to work out a common position. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  Now part of that, Sakir Starmer writing in The Telegraph, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=133.92s)]
*  that the UK is ready and willing to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=137.68s)]
*  by putting our own troops on the ground if necessary. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=142.52s)]
*  I do not take that lightly, he says. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=146.12s)]
*  But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=148.56s)]
*  is helping to guarantee the security of our continent and the security of this country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  President Zelensky has now arrived in the UAE, which has offered to eventually host peace talks. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=158.68s)]
*  The key question for the coming days, who should be at that table? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=165.2s)]
*  Jo Inwood, BBC News. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=169.84s)]
*  Our Europe editor Katja Adler is in Paris. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=173.0s)]
*  She told us more about what's at stake at the European leaders meeting. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=175.4s)]
*  Leaders coming here to Paris see it as a very small window of opportunity [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=180.12s)]
*  to send a clear message to Donald Trump that they are united and indispensable as a voice on Ukraine. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=184.32s)]
*  And they hope to do that by getting the ball rolling on two major issues demanded by Donald Trump. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  Number one, that Europe spends more on its own defence. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  And number two, that Europe sends troops to Ukraine in the case of an eventual ceasefire. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=201.72s)]
*  Of course, Sakir Starmer isn't the only leader coming to Paris who has economic concerns at home. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  But it's not about the fine print today, it's not about the ifs and buts, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  it's about getting that united front and a strong voice and message to Donald Trump to say, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=217.6s)]
*  we've heard you, we're taking action. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=223.0s)]
*  Now sit us at that negotiating table to help decide Ukraine's future. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=225.36s)]
*  There's no knowing whether Washington will be listening, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=230.0s)]
*  but the prime minister will hope to be that bridge between the US and Europe when he heads to Washington in a few days' time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  And Europe doesn't really have anything to lose because if the US is eventually going to turn its back on Ukraine and on Europe [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=239.72s)]
*  in terms of security more broadly, then they're going to have to up their defence game in any case. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=247.04s)]
*  A very big focus at the meeting will be the idea of those troops in Ukraine. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  It's a fraught question because how many troops will Europe have to send? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  The UK will be expected to send a big contingent. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=261.96s)]
*  For how long? Under whose command will they be? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=265.8s)]
*  And what will be their mission statement? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=268.32s)]
*  For example, if Russia breaks the terms of a ceasefire agreement, would those troops be at war with Russia? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=270.0s)]
*  And where would the US be? Would they have their backs? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=276.24s)]
*  So lots of questions. And this meeting in Paris is just step one. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=279.16s)]
*  That was our Europe editor, Katja Adler. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=284.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, Sweden's foreign minister says his country has not ruled out sending peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=286.88s)]
*  His comments followed a similar statement from Sakir Starmer. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=294.68s)]
*  He said he's ready and willing to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine if an agreement is reached. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=298.16s)]
*  Here's our political correspondent, Harry Fiehle. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=304.48s)]
*  It's a significant statement. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  It's the first time the prime minister has expressed publicly a willingness to send British troops to Ukraine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=309.32s)]
*  He says he writes in today's Daily Telegraph newspaper, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=316.36s)]
*  I do not say that lightly. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=319.28s)]
*  I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=321.08s)]
*  But he argues that any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of Europe [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=327.12s)]
*  and the security of this country, he writes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=333.96s)]
*  There were questions for how this would work. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=336.84s)]
*  We heard from a former NATO secretary general at the end of last week saying that any force to guarantee a peace deal would need to be around 100,000. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=339.28s)]
*  And there's certainly no way that the UK military could maintain such a force in its current size. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  So presumably this would be with a coalition of other European countries. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=354.28s)]
*  All questions to be discussed and addressed by European leaders who are meeting today in Paris for an emergency summit. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=358.32s)]
*  And it comes after statements from the White House and US officials over the last few days indicating that the US focus is now not on European security [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=365.92s)]
*  and that European countries must step up to guarantee their own security. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=375.4s)]
*  Our Paris correspondent, Andrew Harding, is following the European leaders meeting. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=381.64s)]
*  So what do you know about what's on the agenda? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=386.04s)]
*  We don't. The French are sort of playing things down at the moment. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=388.76s)]
*  They're saying this is not a formal summit. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=391.4s)]
*  It's an informal meeting of concerned European leaders from NATO, from the European Union and from France, Britain, Germany, Poland and other countries. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=393.08s)]
*  There is no formal agenda. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=403.36s)]
*  There will be no communique at the end. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=405.2s)]
*  But clearly there is deep concern here, not just about long term issues regarding increasing spending on defence budgets [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=407.28s)]
*  and also better integrating Europe's armaments industry, but focusing right now on what's going on between Washington and Moscow [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=415.56s)]
*  and making sure that Europe is at that table if peace negotiations, serious negotiations do go ahead, not just Europe, but Ukraine itself. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=425.48s)]
*  You heard that, Harry, talking about Sakhir Starmer's potential commitment of troops to any future peacekeeping force. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=436.0s)]
*  Well, the French have already. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=444.88s)]
*  A year ago, Emmanuel Macron was talking about committing French troops that caused some consternation. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  Other countries here, like Germany, are really far off that sort of commitment. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=452.67999999999995s)]
*  Poland may be more interested. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=457.23999999999995s)]
*  And I think Keir Starmer hoping to act as a sort of catalyst to nudge more European countries towards making that kind of commitment quickly, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  partly in order to remind Donald Trump that Europe is at the table. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=467.88s)]
*  It has a big stake. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=472.52s)]
*  It is the major contributor of arms and humanitarian support to Ukraine already, and it cannot and should not be sidelined. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=473.64s)]
*  This is an informal gathering, Andrew, but do you get the sense that European countries have been caught off guard by the US's moves in recent days? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=482.76s)]
*  I think they've been caught off guard, shocked and angered by the speed and the ferocity of some of the American comments. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=492.91999999999996s)]
*  And they now need to sort of pick through the last week and work out what is rhetoric, what is comments designed for an American audience, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=500.36s)]
*  and what was said more privately to European leaders that they can hopefully take more seriously and that, as they've sometimes put it, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  America is still talking perhaps behind the scenes about Europe being a serious ally, a serious partner. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=518.92s)]
*  But clearly they've been rattled here by the vehemence of comments, particularly by the Vice President of the United States, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  who's really questioned European democracy and questioned the relationship, the whole nature of the future relationship between America and Europe. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLw4GTFHlKw&t=532.8s)]
