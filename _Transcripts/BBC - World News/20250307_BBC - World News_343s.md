At least 18 people, including four children, were wounded in the overnight Russian attack, according to Ukrainian officials.
 
French-built Mirage jets were used for the first time to push back the attack, according to the country's air force.

# Ukraine's President Zelensky says Russia targeted energy infrastructure | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0)
*  At meantime, let's talk about Ukraine, which has been hit by a wave of Russian missile attacks, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=0.0s)]
*  injuring at least 18 people, including four children. Now, Russia used missiles and drones [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=5.92s)]
*  in several regions of Ukraine and officials say air strikes in Odessa and Kharkiv damaged key [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  infrastructure and destroyed several homes. Ukraine has also confirmed that overnight, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=17.44s)]
*  for the first time, its military deployed French-made Mirage jets. Now, they arrived in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  the country just a month or so ago. And meanwhile, Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=28.4s)]
*  has confirmed that he will travel to Saudi Arabia next week where there will be talks [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=33.92s)]
*  between Ukrainian and US officials on ending the war. Well, let's speak now to Ivana Klimpush [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=38.64s)]
*  Tsintsaadze, who's an MP, a member of parliament in the Ukrainian parliament in Kyiv. She's chair [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=45.68s)]
*  of the Parliamentary Committee on Ukraine's Integration into the European Union. And thank [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=51.2s)]
*  you so much for being with us. First of all, this latest wave of attacks by Russia. Do you think [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=56.16s)]
*  they have been made worse by now the ending or the suspension of American intelligence, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=63.76s)]
*  which Ukraine has in the past used to detect when these missiles are coming in? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=69.6s)]
*  Well, definitely, you know, Ukraine is partially blinded and that, unfortunately, shortens the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=75.6s)]
*  time of the reaction of our air defense capabilities. And, you know, the intelligence [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=82.08s)]
*  sharing is unfortunately not the only thing that has happened. The cut of this intelligence [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=87.2s)]
*  sharing, that's not the only thing that has happened over the last days. It's also the military [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=93.2s)]
*  aid that has been already prepaid and promised to Ukraine from the United States has been cut off. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=98.4s)]
*  And that includes also partially the shells for the rockets for the air defense. And that means [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=103.52s)]
*  in the nearest time we will be much more vulnerable with our residential buildings, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=110.88s)]
*  with infrastructure, with all the attacks that Russia is waging every single night. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=116.56s)]
*  I live in Kyiv and the last probably three and a half weeks there has not been a day or a night [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=123.76s)]
*  without massive, massive drone or combined drone and rocket attack. So Russia does not show any [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=131.12s)]
*  willingness and even a sign or shadow or willingness to get into stopping this war. It's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=140.16s)]
*  really in Russian's hands. And I suppose more, I mean, more Ukrainian civilians will die and will [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=147.36s)]
*  be injured because of that withdrawal of American intelligence, because as you say, it shortens the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=155.6s)]
*  time that the advance notice that the Ukrainians have when these missiles and drones are coming [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=162.24s)]
*  in. And often these are infrastructure attacks. They are on civilian areas. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=168.72s)]
*  They are. And, you know, I really think that pausing the military aid and pausing the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=173.76s)]
*  intelligence sharing does not have anything to do with the protection of civilian lives of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=182.0s)]
*  Ukrainians across the country. So if we are talking about civilian, you know, stopping about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=188.72s)]
*  of the bloodshed, that has little to do with the stopping. Now, as I mentioned, there are going to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=196.16s)]
*  be these talks between Ukrainian and American officials in Saudi Arabia. What's your reading [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=203.12s)]
*  of that? Do you think that is the first stage of this peace process that President Trump wants to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=210.64s)]
*  see ending the war? You know, that's one of the first stages. I think very critical that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=216.16s)]
*  Ukraine is coordinating right now its efforts and its vision also with the European [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=222.88s)]
*  capitals, with European countries. And I hope that that will be also already a common vision that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=228.0s)]
*  will be brought by the Ukrainian delegation to do the meeting with American counterparts. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=234.48s)]
*  And yeah, well, we see it as one of the first steps in that direction. But at the same time, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  we do not yet, you know, have the vision and the plan from the American colleagues as well. You [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  know, there has been so much talk about the quick ending of the war. But besides the claims that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  the fighting has to stop, nothing else has been presented. So I think it's important that we talk. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=263.36s)]
*  I think it's important that we keep our American counterparts, our American colleagues engaged. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=269.04s)]
*  And this is our common, common task, both for us Ukrainians and also for Europeans. But at the same [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  time, we do not know what that round will bring. Because it's a week or so now, isn't it, since that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  sort of meltdown in the Oval Office of the White House between Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=287.6s)]
*  and President Zelensky. Do you think relations in the day since then have been repaired a little [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  bit between Ukraine and the United States? I don't think that they have been repaired. But I think [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=298.48s)]
*  there have been some positive steps made from the Ukrainian authorities in that direction. And we [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  hope that they will be followed by at least the first step of restoring the pause with the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=313.84s)]
*  provision of the military aid and intelligence sharing back on track to Ukraine. And from there, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=323.68s)]
*  I think we could go further. Because I don't see that only pressuring the victim is going to lead [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=330.4s)]
*  us to any just and sustainable and lasting peace, not only in Ukraine, but also on the European [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=336.8s)]
*  continent. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKfMoxBHeA0&t=342.56s)]
