**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM)
*  Think of your messiest night out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=0.0s)]
*  Was it worse than this person's? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=2.56s)]
*  A Japanese finance ministry employee [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  who lost documents containing the personal data [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=7.0s)]
*  of 187 people whilst on a night out with colleagues. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=10.0s)]
*  And it gets worse, there were pretty sensitive documents. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=15.08s)]
*  They contained the names and addresses [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  of drug smuggling suspects. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=22.12s)]
*  The employee who hasn't been named [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=24.8s)]
*  reportedly drank nine glasses of beer [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=26.72s)]
*  in the space of five hours [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=29.48s)]
*  and didn't realise that their bag was missing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  until they got off the train on the way home. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=34.4s)]
*  I mean, that's happened to the best of us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=37.0s)]
*  The finance ministry said it's deeply sorry for the incident [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=39.2s)]
*  that significantly undermined public trust. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=42.36s)]
*  That's according to public broadcaster NHK. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50UIJO7lVM&t=45.1s)]
