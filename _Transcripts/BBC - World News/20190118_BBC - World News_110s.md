**BBC - World News:** [January 18, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k)
*  I served as medic and grenade launcher operator in the Ukrainian volunteer battalion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=0.0s)]
*  I couldn't tell to anybody about that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=13.0s)]
*  Although guys were constantly asking me to whom I'm going out. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=15.5s)]
*  They asked me to show some photos of the lady whom I visited. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=21.5s)]
*  They asked me to show her story, her name. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=28.0s)]
*  I was inventing all the time. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=32.0s)]
*  I had to go to the place where she said goodbye. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=41.0s)]
*  It was very difficult for me to accept myself as gay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=44.0s)]
*  When we returned to the civilian life, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=52.0s)]
*  we encountered people who were shouting that LGBT people or people of different nationalities [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=55.0s)]
*  are people of the lower quality. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=65.0s)]
*  They shouldn't be part of the society and they shouldn't have the same rights. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=70.0s)]
*  Well, in order to cope with this, I came out. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=79.0s)]
*  The general public responded positively and my comrades responded positively as well. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=86.0s)]
*  They all kept saying that I was a good soldier. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=93.0s)]
*  I was like a normal soldier. They know me as a normal combatant. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=98.0s)]
*  I was fighting for Ukraine as they are. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=102.0s)]
*  Being gay does not change anything. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxggvWQwS8k&t=106.0s)]
