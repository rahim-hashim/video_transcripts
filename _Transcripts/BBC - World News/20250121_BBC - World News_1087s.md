# Marco Rubio sworn in as US Secretary of State | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA)
*  It is lunchtime here in Washington, D.C., and the first full day of Donald Trump's second [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=0.0s)]
*  term in the White House is now well underway. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  It started, as is tradition, with the National Prayer Service at Washington National Cathedral. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=7.24s)]
*  You see there the Trumps alongside the Vances, Vice President J.D. Vance and his wife, Usha [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=12.92s)]
*  Vance, there in the front row. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=18.12s)]
*  A moment of reflection, perhaps, ahead of the whirlwind to come. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=19.44s)]
*  And that whirlwind started on Monday evening with what could be described as a deluge of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=23.32s)]
*  executive orders. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=27.94s)]
*  Take a look at Mr. Trump signing those documents in the White House. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=29.88s)]
*  You'll remember his unique style, too many to mention individually, but among the most [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=33.08s)]
*  eye-catching of those orders, a full pardon for nearly 1,600 of his supporters who were [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=37.54s)]
*  arrested in the riot at the U.S. Capitol in 2021, orders to start the process of withdrawing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=42.56s)]
*  the U.S. from the U.N.'s health body, the World Health Organization, and the Paris climate [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  agreement. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=53.44s)]
*  There was also the declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, ordering [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=54.44s)]
*  the military to, quote, seal the borders due to the threat of crime. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=58.24s)]
*  And President Trump is expected to talk about his infrastructure plans a little later. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  But before that, we are now going to hear from the newly confirmed secretary of state, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=67.12s)]
*  Marco Rubio. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  He's making remarks at the State Department. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring up those pictures and take a look at that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=74.76s)]
*  And let's listen in as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=77.12s)]
*  Earlier, Mr. Rubio became the first of the Cabinet nominees to take his oath of office [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=78.4s)]
*  in a ceremony overseen by the vice president. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=82.36s)]
*  Here's what he had to say afterwards. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  President Trump was elected to keep promises, and he's going to keep those promises. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  And his primary promise when it comes to foreign policy is that the priority of the United [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=92.2s)]
*  States Department of State will be the United States. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  It will be furthering the national interest of this country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=99.72s)]
*  And he's given us a very clear mandate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  President Trump's made it very clear. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Everything we do, and this is true in government, but especially at the Department of State, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=105.92s)]
*  everything we do must be justified by the answer to one of three questions. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=110.28s)]
*  Does it make us stronger? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=113.68s)]
*  Does it make us safer? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  And does it make us more prosperous? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=116.72000000000001s)]
*  If it doesn't do one of those three things, we will not do it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=118.76s)]
*  OK, that was Marco Rubio when he was sworn in. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=122.04s)]
*  He's now speaking at the State Department. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  And I'm very proud of my wife, my four children and their support. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  My wife, Jeanette, who... [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  Her parents immigrated here from Colombia. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=133.28s)]
*  Anybody here from Colombia? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=145.04s)]
*  Anybody cover Colombia? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=146.08s)]
*  And then my oldest daughter, Amanda. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=150.52s)]
*  Say hello, Amanda. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=154.36s)]
*  And then came Daniella. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=158.64s)]
*  And now Anthony. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=165.72s)]
*  And our youngest, Dominic. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  So these three... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  These three are in school, meaning, you know, college and even jobs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=175.1s)]
*  We're still working. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=180.0s)]
*  He's doing good. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=181.0s)]
*  He's a junior in high school. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=182.0s)]
*  And obviously my family beyond that is here who made this possible. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  My wife's mom, Maria, is here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=188.28s)]
*  And my sisters, Barbara and Veronica, are here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of friends that came from Miami who joined us here today. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=192.12s)]
*  And I'm grateful. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  And thank you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=198.16s)]
*  I also want to recognize my former colleagues from the Congressional branch who also happen [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=199.16s)]
*  to be appropriators and authorizers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=205.52s)]
*  And so I thought it was important... [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  Three people I've known for a long time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=211.84s)]
*  And by coincidence, Florida is very well represented in the authorization and appropriations in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=213.44s)]
*  the House. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=218.32s)]
*  Mario Diaz-Balart, who I... [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=219.32s)]
*  Who I've known as a personal friend. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=224.32s)]
*  We served together in the Florida legislature. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=228.6s)]
*  In fact, sat next to each other on the floor. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  Who would have thought, Mario, back in the day? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  And now here we are, you know? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  And two Cuban Americans. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=236.2s)]
*  If we had a third, they'd call it a conspiracy, but there's only two, so we're in shape. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=239.2s)]
*  Congresswoman Lois Frankel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  We also served in the legislature together. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=246.32s)]
*  Again, I know this... [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  I know it looks suspicious. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=256.52s)]
*  She just happens to be from Florida as well, and they happen to be on that committee. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=257.52s)]
*  And then of course, my colleague, Brian Maast, who... [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=261.48s)]
*  Thank you for being here as well. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=264.48s)]
*  I have asked them as a personal favor to be nice to each of you who we send over to testify [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=273.12s)]
*  and appear before their committees. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=277.32s)]
*  And then to be nice to us when they write those appropriations bills and pass those [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=280.52s)]
*  laws. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=284.56s)]
*  But we are great... [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=285.56s)]
*  I'm really grateful you would join us, because our partnership will be critically important. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=286.56s)]
*  I want to thank President Trump for nominating me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=289.88s)]
*  This is an extraordinary honor and a privilege to serve in this role. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=291.8s)]
*  To be here, frankly, to oversee the greatest, the most effective, the most talented, the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=296.16s)]
*  most experienced diplomatic corps in the history of the world resides in this building. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=302.88s)]
*  And it's important to remember that obviously they serve our national interest and our foreign [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=313.88s)]
*  policy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=322.32s)]
*  They also serve Americans. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=323.32s)]
*  And as a member of the Senate, we often would get calls for a brief period of time, panic [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=324.32s)]
*  calls about passports. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=330.2s)]
*  As you remember that era, when everyone forgot their passport expired and their cruise was [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=332.08s)]
*  on Saturday and it's Friday, 5 p.m. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=336.72s)]
*  So we were... [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=339.8s)]
*  Why are you guys chuckling? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=340.8s)]
*  Is that... [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=342.68s)]
*  You know it's true, it's happened. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=343.68s)]
*  And then of course, but we also serve Americans that sometimes find themselves overseas and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=345.44s)]
*  lost their passport or even worse, something terrible or tragic happened and their families [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=350.2s)]
*  are impacted by it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=355.32s)]
*  And so it's important, it's an important task and one that I know is critical to our mission. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=357.24s)]
*  Beyond that, this is the face of the United States. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=363.12s)]
*  In fact, if you think about it, for many people on this planet, their only interaction with [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=365.12s)]
*  America, most will never travel here, their only interaction with America in many cases, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=370.48s)]
*  whether they be leaders or everyday people, will be the men and women who serve us abroad [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  and do so with tremendous integrity and dedication. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  They are literally the face of our country. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=383.44s)]
*  Whether it's through the aid we've provided or through the services. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  I also want to say hello, and is this being live streamed somewhere? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  People watching this on all of our missions? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  Good, I want to thank them. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=393.56s)]
*  I know they can't be with us here today and depending on where they are in the world, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=394.56s)]
*  it's probably not as cold as it's been, at least for a Floridian. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=398.20000000000005s)]
*  So I also think the brilliance of this organization shows by hosting these events indoors, which [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  it's already showing and we're grateful for that as well. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=409.0s)]
*  But I want to tell you that I want to thank you all those who are serving overseas and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=412.24s)]
*  abroad, some in places that are strong and stable and others that are more tenuous and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=415.68s)]
*  dangerous. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=419.96s)]
*  And I want to do something also special. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=420.96s)]
*  I want to also thank the locally employed staff, the nationals of those countries who [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=422.72s)]
*  work with us. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=427.2s)]
*  Without their help, without their support, it would be impossible for us to conduct our [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=428.2s)]
*  mission and in many ways, years later, I've run into people, literally run into people [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=448.4s)]
*  in the United States that are either conducting business or visiting as tourists or what have [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=453.08s)]
*  you, and they will tell me they were locally employed and they're local employees of our [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=457.16s)]
*  missions abroad and as a result, their love for our country is never ending. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=462.08s)]
*  I am new to this department. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=466.72s)]
*  Today is my first day on the job, literally, but I am not a stranger to it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=468.0s)]
*  I've interacted with many of you, both in my travels abroad and in our daily functions. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=472.36s)]
*  My job now is different and our job in some ways will be different. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=476.4s)]
*  In our republic, the voters decide the course of our nation, both domestically and abroad, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=480.36s)]
*  and they have elected Donald J. Trump as our president when it comes to foreign policy [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=485.54s)]
*  on a very clear mission. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=489.18s)]
*  And that mission is to ensure that our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=490.94s)]
*  is the advancement of our national interest, which they have clearly defined through his [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=495.38s)]
*  campaign as anything that makes us stronger or safer or more prosperous. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=499.24s)]
*  And that will be our mission. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=505.32000000000005s)]
*  That will be our job across the world is to ensure that we have a foreign policy that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=507.12s)]
*  advances the national interest of the United States. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=511.20000000000005s)]
*  I expect every nation on earth to advance their national interests. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=513.92s)]
*  And in those instances, and I hope there will be many, in which our national interest and [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=517.5799999999999s)]
*  theirs align, we look forward to working with them. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=521.48s)]
*  This is in many ways, and again it was referenced by President Trump yesterday in his speech [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  that he designs that his overriding goal for global policy is the promotion of peace, the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=528.8199999999999s)]
*  avoidance of conflict, and no agency will be more critical in that regard than this [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=534.76s)]
*  one. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=539.12s)]
*  That's its founding principle and purpose, and that's what we endeavor to do, to promote [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=540.14s)]
*  peace around the world because that's in our national interest. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=544.24s)]
*  Without peace, it is hard to be a strong nation, a prosperous nation, and one that is better [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=546.64s)]
*  off. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=551.28s)]
*  But there will also be challenges. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=552.28s)]
*  We recognize that there will be those times, unfortunately, as humans interact with one [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=554.02s)]
*  another because of our nature, but there will be conflict. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=558.62s)]
*  We will seek to prevent them and avoid them, but never at the expense of our national security, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=561.54s)]
*  never at the expense of our national interest, and never at the expense of our core values [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=565.64s)]
*  as a nation and as a people. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=569.56s)]
*  We are, at the end of the day, a nation founded on a powerful principle, and that powerful [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=571.96s)]
*  principle is that all men are created equal because our rights come from God, our creator, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=576.04s)]
*  not from our laws, not from our governments, and we hope the entire world can one day live [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=580.86s)]
*  under that and we will always, always be strong defenders of that principle, never at the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=585.16s)]
*  expense of our national interest, never at the expense of pragmatic foreign policy, never [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=590.12s)]
*  at the expense of the reality that oftentimes in foreign policy our choices are not between [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=594.74s)]
*  are between a bad option and a good option. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=599.36s)]
*  Sometimes in foreign relations, our options are two bad ones, and we're just trying to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=602.6s)]
*  figure out which one of them is least bad. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=606.6400000000001s)]
*  And that's unfortunate, but it is true. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=609.12s)]
*  And that's a tough job. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=611.36s)]
*  It's our job, and we'll seek to do it right and well. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=612.48s)]
*  That is the core mission of this agency, and it will be the core mission while Donald Trump [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=615.7600000000001s)]
*  is president, and we will be effective on his behalf. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=619.5600000000001s)]
*  I also want this agency to be, and I don't mean, not that it's irrelevant now, but I [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=623.24s)]
*  want it to be where it belongs. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=627.7399999999999s)]
*  I want the Department of State to be at the center of how America and great gauges the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=629.2199999999999s)]
*  world, not just how we execute on it, but on how we formulate it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=633.5s)]
*  Some of the brightest minds in foreign policy reside within this building and within this [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=637.8199999999999s)]
*  government, and we need to ensure that we have an environment here that's conducive [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=641.54s)]
*  to creativity, to boldness, to new ideas, to recognizing the dynamic world in which [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=646.2199999999999s)]
*  we live, one that is changing faster than it has ever changed before, and we need to [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=651.74s)]
*  be ahead of it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=656.3199999999999s)]
*  When the time comes for the principals to gather, or even deputies, I want the Department [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=657.56s)]
*  of State to have the best ideas and the best options available for the president, and then [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=661.7199999999999s)]
*  I want us to be able to execute them better than any agency in our government. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=666.16s)]
*  That will also be a task of mine. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=670.64s)]
*  I have watched from the congressional side from time to time, administrations in both [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=672.56s)]
*  parties, and which sometimes the Department of State has been sort of relegated to a secondary [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=676.04s)]
*  role because some other agency can move faster or seems to be bolder or more creative. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=681.78s)]
*  It's not your fault, but we're going to change that. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=686.98s)]
*  We want to be at the centerpiece, we want to be at the core of how we formulate foreign [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=689.86s)]
*  policy because we're going to have the best ideas of any agency and because we're going [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=693.86s)]
*  to execute it better and faster and more effectively than any other agency in our government, and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=698.6s)]
*  I know we have the right team to do it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=704.06s)]
*  There's no other agency in the world, there's no other agency in our government that I'd [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=706.3s)]
*  rather lead because of the talent that's collected here in this room and those watching around [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=709.52s)]
*  the world. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=714.12s)]
*  That will be our mission, and I hope we'll be able to do it together. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=715.36s)]
*  There will be changes, but the changes are not meant to be destructive, they're not meant [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=718.74s)]
*  to be punitive, they're not out of, the changes will be because we need to be a 21st century [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=722.12s)]
*  agency that can move by a cliché that's used by many at the speed of relevance, but we [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=727.52s)]
*  need to move faster than we ever have because the world is changing faster than we ever [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=732.88s)]
*  have. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=736.48s)]
*  We have to have a view that some say it's called look around the corner, but we really [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=737.48s)]
*  need to be thinking about where are we going to be in five, seven, ten or 15 years? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=740.78s)]
*  Some of the issues that confront humanity today have no precedent, they have no historic [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=745.78s)]
*  precedent, some of the challenges we face have no historic precedent. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=750.14s)]
*  We can compare it to another era, to another time, but they're not the same. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=753.74s)]
*  Things are moving faster than ever. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  Think about how much the world has changed in the last five years. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=759.84s)]
*  Imagine how much it will change over the next 25 years. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=763.22s)]
*  And my sincerest hope and my prayer is that we will as a nation be able to leave the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=765.94s)]
*  future generations with a country and a planet safer and better than the one that was left [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=771.6400000000001s)]
*  for us and you will be a big part of achieving that goal. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=777.62s)]
*  It is an honor to be able to lead this agency. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=781.0400000000001s)]
*  I hope to do it with distinction and with integrity, working harder than anyone ever [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=783.3000000000001s)]
*  has at this role and that will not be easy because some pretty hardworking people have [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  come before me, but I know that we are up to the task and I'm glad that I'm in the job, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=791.76s)]
*  that I'm in the job on day one. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=797.06s)]
*  I was sworn in at about 9.15, I didn't mess up the oath and we're ready to go to work [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=798.9s)]
*  and I know you are as well. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=804.36s)]
*  Thank you, God bless all of you. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=805.8199999999999s)]
*  God bless our country. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=807.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=808.48s)]
*  Okay, you're watching their Marco Rubio, the newly sworn in Secretary of State in Donald [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=809.48s)]
*  Trump's administration, he was sworn in earlier this morning, speaking to staff at the State [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=819.92s)]
*  Department. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=823.76s)]
*  He was speaking also to the staff there and as he said to the staff serving the State [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=824.76s)]
*  Department abroad, including as he said the local staff flanked there by his wife and [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=829.14s)]
*  their children. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=834.54s)]
*  Now Marco Rubio was voted in by all 99 senators, he was unanimously voted in so he had the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=835.74s)]
*  support of all of the senators. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=843.6999999999999s)]
*  Of course he was serving as a senator from Florida until he took on this post. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=845.52s)]
*  He said his agency will be critical in promoting peace around the world and he also said he [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=850.5799999999999s)]
*  wanted this agency to be quote, where it belongs, at the center of how America engages with [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=856.5s)]
*  the world. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  So Marco Rubio as you see there at the State Department taking up his new role in this [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=863.3199999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump administration. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=868.0799999999999s)]
*  Our correspondent Ioni Wells has been following this for us today. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=869.48s)]
*  What do you think this message is that Marco Rubio is sending to the rest of the world, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=874.12s)]
*  of course allies and adversaries on day one as Secretary of State? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=878.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=883.44s)]
*  Well I think one significant thing about his appointment in general, he is the first Latino [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=887.64s)]
*  American to serve as the US's top diplomat and he's made it pretty clear that he plans [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=892.32s)]
*  to take quite a hard line stance against the countries that he sees as the US's adversaries, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=897.04s)]
*  namely to the south, Cuba, Venezuela in particular. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=903.08s)]
*  He's from a Cuban family. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=906.84s)]
*  He I think is pretty set to reverse a policy that Joe Biden only recently did which was [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=908.2s)]
*  to remove Cuba from a list of countries accused of sponsoring terrorist groups. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=914.44s)]
*  That's something which I think certainly Marco Rubio plans to reverse. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=920.08s)]
*  Secondly, I think it's likely that he will take a tougher stance on Nicolas Maduro's [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=923.5600000000001s)]
*  government in Venezuela as well, potentially removing some of the remaining licenses that [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=929.48s)]
*  exist for oil sales and essentially strengthening the sanctions regime against Venezuela. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=934.96s)]
*  I think that's something that's likely to happen. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=940.76s)]
*  One of the kind of interesting things as well to bear in mind about him will be sort of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=942.96s)]
*  what his response is more widely given some of Trump's statements in recent days around, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=946.16s)]
*  for example, wanting to take Greenland, wanting to take ownership of the Panama Canal, both [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=952.48s)]
*  of which have been strongly rejected by both Denmark in the case of Greenland, but also [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=957.4s)]
*  by Panama's government when it comes to the canal. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=961.28s)]
*  So how he will be sort of responsible when it comes to negotiating what Trump has indicated [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=964.04s)]
*  that he wants to do in those cases. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=970.08s)]
*  I think there's also then this question more generally, which will be how does he or what [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=972.36s)]
*  moves does he do to try and implement what Trump has described as a desire to end current [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=977.52s)]
*  conflicts both in Ukraine but also in the Middle East as well? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=982.44s)]
*  He still hasn't given very much detail on what exactly he plans to do when he's made [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=986.92s)]
*  those very bold claims both during the campaign but also since becoming president. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=991.2s)]
*  So I think that will be something which Marco Rubio will have to sort of essentially be [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=995.88s)]
*  intending to spell out more detail on. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1001.36s)]
*  All right, indeed, Ayanis. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1003.08s)]
*  We're looking at these pictures still of Marco Rubio at the State Department. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1004.72s)]
*  This is, of course, the first full day for Donald Trump in his second term. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1008.4s)]
*  Give us an idea of what the day has looked like for him. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1012.5s)]
*  Well, he's been sort of meeting with top Republicans today. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1017.88s)]
*  Of course, he's announced a flurry of different executive orders in the last 24 hours since [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1021.56s)]
*  his swearing in as president. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1027.44s)]
*  Notably as well, he has pardoned more than 1500 people involved with storming the Capitol [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1029.6s)]
*  building who had been either some of whom have now been released from prison since. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1036.28s)]
*  But he's also been sort of essentially cancelling any sort of existing legal action for some [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1042.68s)]
*  of those still facing consequences of those riots that took place. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1047.76s)]
*  He's also removed the US from some key treaties, including sort of saying that he's going to [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1051.8000000000002s)]
*  remove the US from the WHO, who he heavily criticized during the Covid pandemic, but [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1057.5600000000002s)]
*  also saying ordering officials to remove the US from the Paris climate treaty as well. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1062.1200000000001s)]
*  Again, it's something which he had done previously as president, but something which he has shown [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1068.1599999999999s)]
*  his intention to do again. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1073.32s)]
*  Of course, immigration was a big feature of his campaign, as we know, and that is something [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1074.84s)]
*  which he has also been a big focus of his executive orders, in particular when it comes [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1078.9199999999998s)]
*  to his desire to shut down the Mexico border. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-JvCNZWIA&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
