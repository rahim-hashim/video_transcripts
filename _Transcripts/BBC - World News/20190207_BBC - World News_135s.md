Video Description: US President Donald Trump has said territory held by the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could be "100%" liberated as early as next week.
"It should be announced, probably some time next week, that we will have 100% of the caliphate," he told a gathering of coalition partners.
However, he also cautioned that he wanted to "wait for the official word".
US military and intelligence officials say IS could stage a comeback without sustained counter-terrorism pressure.

*  Thank you very much, Mike, and you are doing a spectacular job. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=0.0s)]
*  As I noted in my State of the Union address yesterday, the United States military, our [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  coalition partners, and the Syrian Democratic Forces have liberated virtually all of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=15.4s)]
*  territory previously held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=22.88s)]
*  It should be formally announced sometime probably next week that we will have 100 percent of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=28.52s)]
*  the caliphate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=36.32s)]
*  But I want to wait for the official word. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=39.08s)]
*  I don't want to say it too early. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=41.04s)]
*  And hopefully they won't be around very long. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=44.4s)]
*  They can no longer control schools to impose their vicious ideology on young children. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=47.96s)]
*  Critically, ISIS also now lacks a significant territorial base from which to launch terrorist [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=58.4s)]
*  attacks against other countries, recruit foreign fighters, and spread havoc across the region. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=65.52s)]
*  Their land is gone. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  It's a big factor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=76.64s)]
*  Their land is gone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=78.72s)]
*  This afternoon, I want to applaud the outstanding men and women of the United States military, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=80.66s)]
*  incredible people, for their remarkable skill and precision throughout this entire campaign. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=86.12s)]
*  Now as countries in the region and across our coalition step up their commitments, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=93.28s)]
*  and we continue to destroy the remnants, that's all they have, remnants. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=101.44s)]
*  But remnants can be very dangerous. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=106.16s)]
*  Have to remember that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=109.0s)]
*  A remnant can be very dangerous. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=110.5s)]
*  But we have remnants of ISIS. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  We look forward to giving our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome back home. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_OlBTB0nE&t=116.19999999999999s)]
