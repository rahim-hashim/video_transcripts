Video Description: China has slapped retaliatory tariffs of 84% on all US imports, deepening a trade war between Beijing and Washington.

It comes as President Donald Trump had earlier put a 104% tariff on Chinese goods - but later raised this to 125%, citing a "lack of respect" from China.

Trump has paused higher tariffs on other countries, though a "universal 10%" levy will be in place.
 
Financial markets in Asia jumped following news of the reprieve, with one expert saying the region is 'breathing a massive sigh of reliefâ€™.

# China hits back at Trump with 84% tariffs on US as trade war intensifies | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20)
*  Donald Trump says he is open to talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping after imposing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=0.0s)]
*  an even higher tariff of 125% on China. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=6.04s)]
*  In a dramatic shift in policy, the US President has paused higher tariffs on goods entering [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=11.72s)]
*  the US with the exception of China, which has announced retaliatory tariffs of 84% on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=16.9s)]
*  US goods that came into effect just over an hour ago. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=24.12s)]
*  Mr Trump accused Beijing of showing a lack of respect by retaliating. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=28.76s)]
*  So these are the tariffs that took effect on Wednesday, affecting dozens of countries. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  However, just hours after their implementation, President Trump announced all those would-be [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=40.36s)]
*  polls for 90 days and rolled back to a baseline of 10%. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=46.6s)]
*  President Trump says he can't imagine he'd have to raise tariffs on China further and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=52.56s)]
*  has no concerns of any escalations in relations beyond trade. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=57.32s)]
*  Here's our North America correspondent, Peter Beaus. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=61.6s)]
*  Unthinkable at the start of the week, but Wall Street had something to celebrate at [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=69.6s)]
*  last night's closing bell. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=73.92s)]
*  It was all smiles and cheers as the financial markets soared. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=75.84s)]
*  Stock prices jumped with one of the biggest one-day gains in history as soon as Donald [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump revealed a 90-day pause. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=85.16s)]
*  Share prices in Asia also rebounded strongly in early trading, recovering after a tumultuous [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  week. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=94.36s)]
*  The news that sparked a global sigh of relief came in a social media post from President [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=95.48s)]
*  Trump, a substantially lowered reciprocal tariff of 10% effective immediately. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=100.36s)]
*  That baseline stays for everyone except Mexico, Canada and China, with Beijing being slammed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=107.24s)]
*  harder than ever with a levy of 125%, way above everyone else. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=113.94s)]
*  The president said he'd been thinking about his new plan for a few days and had noticed [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=120.86s)]
*  people were getting a little queasy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=125.18s)]
*  It was written from the heart. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=127.78s)]
*  It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=128.78s)]
*  And we don't want to hurt countries that don't need to be hurt. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  And they all want to negotiate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=138.66s)]
*  The only problem is, you know, you can only do so many at one time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=140.38s)]
*  It's like we want to do it right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=143.06s)]
*  We want to get it right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=146.38s)]
*  Given what Mr Trump has said in the last few days, his apparent change of heart came out [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  of the blue. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=154.18s)]
*  But was it always the president's plan to rattle the world's markets and especially [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=155.38s)]
*  China to get his way? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=159.26s)]
*  The US Treasury Secretary seems to think it was. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=161.38s)]
*  This was his strategy all along. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=164.2s)]
*  You might even say that he go to China into a bad position. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  They responded. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=174.34s)]
*  They have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actors. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=175.42s)]
*  Donald Trump insists he's doing what his predecessors should have done decades ago to get a better [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=179.34s)]
*  deal for America. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=184.34s)]
*  He says China's leader will eventually come to the table. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=185.94s)]
*  I think President Xi is a very smart guy and I think we'll end up making a very good deal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=189.14s)]
*  for both. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=195.14s)]
*  But you know, we've been treated so badly for so many years. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=196.82s)]
*  Again, we allow that to happen. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=200.14s)]
*  For now, the White House says it's working on at least 75 requests from other countries [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  to negotiate new trade deals. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=208.17999999999998s)]
*  For American consumers, the latest twist could be welcome news that prices in the shops may [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=210.73999999999998s)]
*  not rise as much as they'd feared. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=216.17999999999998s)]
*  Peter Beaux, BBC News, Washington. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=218.94s)]
*  Well, I talked to Daniel Lippman, who's the White House reporter at Politico. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=221.14s)]
*  I asked him for his assessment on the pause of the higher tariffs. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=225.58s)]
*  It looks like he did not want to have a depression or a major recession on his hands, where he [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  would be the only person who would get blamed for that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=236.3s)]
*  So his Treasury and Commerce Secretary were with him almost 24 hours ago in the Oval Office [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  explaining that financial markets were on the verge of seizing up and that he had to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=245.82000000000002s)]
*  reverse course. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=251.3s)]
*  And he's gotten so much criticism from Republican senators, even top supporters like Ted Cruz, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=252.5s)]
*  who said this could have been a massive mistake if we had kept these tariffs on. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=258.26s)]
*  And so that clearly spooked him and he didn't want to get that type of blame. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=262.86s)]
*  Which is really interesting because he, till that point, had been saying, we have to endure [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=267.58000000000004s)]
*  the pain. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=273.74s)]
*  Yes, markets are explosive. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=274.74s)]
*  We're seeing a reaction, but we're going to see this one through. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=276.98s)]
*  I've got the courage to do that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=280.26s)]
*  But actually, he didn't have a choice in the end. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=282.38s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think he had the courage because he doesn't want to have Republicans lose out [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=286.14s)]
*  big in the midterm elections next November, next year. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=292.7s)]
*  And remember, he was elected on a basis of reducing prices and combating inflation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=298.58s)]
*  He had blamed Joe Biden for that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=306.06s)]
*  And so for prices to go up wildly with iPhones and every good basically coming into the U.S., [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  except for some select goods from Canada and Mexico, he was not willing to see that through. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=316.86s)]
*  And so we should remember, he loves to keep people on their toes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=323.54s)]
*  Remember, he had The Apprentice. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  And so he views every day as almost a TV show episode, a new episode. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=330.02000000000004s)]
*  And so he wants to kind of keep people tuning in and having lots of suspense and wild twists [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=335.58s)]
*  and turns. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=342.85999999999996s)]
*  And so today he certainly delivered on that for sure. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  And the question is, what damage has that done? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=346.82s)]
*  Because now in terms of trading partners, countries around the world, there is a lot [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=350.5s)]
*  of distrust. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=356.34s)]
*  Yeah, because it makes it very hard for companies, multinationals to invest in the U.S. because [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=357.34s)]
*  we don't know what's going to happen at the end of those 90 days if there are some countries [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  that don't make deals. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  And so they can't just plan with every week with new policies. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=370.82s)]
*  And so I think they're kind of having to get used to that this is how Trump operates. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=377.06s)]
*  And we could still well see a recession. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=383.38s)]
*  But I think that he's hoping to have more announcements of new manufacturing facilities [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=386.26s)]
*  in the U.S. But it just makes it very hard for companies who have long term planning [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=392.46s)]
*  to actually make investments in the U.S. and abroad because they see that policy just changes [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=399.29999999999995s)]
*  on a dime. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=405.14s)]
*  And Daniel, what are you hearing? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=406.14s)]
*  What's the gossip about how all this has been going down in the White House in terms of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  the team? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=412.94s)]
*  Elon Musk and others. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=413.94s)]
*  Elon Musk has been very vocal, as ever, about his criticism about various members of Trump's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=415.41999999999996s)]
*  team during this process of this week, which has been tumultuous. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=421.42s)]
*  How has it impacted his team? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=425.70000000000005s)]
*  I think that we've seen more divisions on this issue than almost any other issue. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=429.5s)]
*  Most of their issues, they're totally aligned on. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=434.26000000000005s)]
*  They want to cut taxes. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=437.42s)]
*  They want to reduce regulations. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=438.70000000000005s)]
*  But for Elon Musk, he has a lot of business operations in China. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=440.74s)]
*  He makes a lot of Tesla's there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=444.54s)]
*  So he hasn't been thrilled about the tariffs there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=446.26000000000005s)]
*  He has called for a zero tariffs with the U.S. and Europe just in the last few days. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=449.38s)]
*  And he got in squabbles with the trade adviser, Pena Navarro, where the White House press [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=455.73999999999995s)]
*  secretary said, oh, boys will be boys because they're arguing about tariffs. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=461.82s)]
*  And so Trump kind of has angels and demons on both sides of his shoulder. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=466.02s)]
*  And he every day kind of listens to one side or the other. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=472.17999999999995s)]
*  Daniel Lippman there, White House reporter for Politico, just explaining what's going [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=476.29999999999995s)]
*  on within the White House at the moment. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=480.26s)]
*  Let's then go to our Asia business hub. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=482.14s)]
*  Nick Marsh is watching markets for us now. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=485.02s)]
*  Hello to you, Nick. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  Just looking at Japan, it's still up something like 8.6 percent. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=488.62s)]
*  The rally continues. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=492.73999999999995s)]
*  Certainly does. Yeah, they're recouping those huge losses that we saw yesterday. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=495.02s)]
*  It's the same picture in Seoul, in Taipei, in Australia as well. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=498.58s)]
*  These are key manufacturing hubs that we're talking about, big exporters to the United States. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=503.90000000000003s)]
*  They're going to start negotiations with Washington to see what can be done there. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=509.70000000000005s)]
*  The big exception, obviously, that you've been covering all morning is, of course, China. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=515.46s)]
*  That's facing this incredible 125 percent tariffs after Beijing said that it wouldn't be negotiating. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=520.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, clearly, that is a blow to China. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=527.9s)]
*  They had been hoping to unite the rest of the world against what they called Trump's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=530.02s)]
*  trade tyranny. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=536.14s)]
*  Doesn't seem like that's going to happen now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=538.1800000000001s)]
*  Doesn't mean, though, that there is an appetite for a fight in Beijing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=540.86s)]
*  I mean, we know that the policymakers there have been preparing for this sort of scenario, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=544.14s)]
*  a second Trump term, an all out trade war for many, many years now. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=548.82s)]
*  And the simple calculation is that basically the United States needs China more than China [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=552.82s)]
*  needs the United States. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=558.9s)]
*  If American consumers aren't going to buy Chinese goods, cheap Chinese goods, where [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=560.34s)]
*  are they going to buy them from? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=565.1800000000001s)]
*  If American farmers aren't going to sell to China, where are they going to sell to? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=566.74s)]
*  And the thinking goes that Chinese manufacturers can sell to their own vast domestic market. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=571.5s)]
*  They can sell to other countries. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=578.78s)]
*  Can the United States quite do the same? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=581.26s)]
*  That is the thinking, of course. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=584.66s)]
*  So we're going to have to see clearly how this plays out. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=586.98s)]
*  That is basically what underpinned Trump's entire philosophy in the first place, that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=590.1s)]
*  the US is too reliant on China. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=595.74s)]
*  This is why he's come in with these sledgehammer tariffs. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=597.5s)]
*  So although there has been a measure, let's say, of resolution for at least 90 days in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=601.58s)]
*  some Asian countries, China is obviously the big exception. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=606.82s)]
*  And China is by far the most important player, not just in the regional economy, but in the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=610.1800000000001s)]
*  world economy when it comes to the United States trade policy. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=614.9s)]
*  Yes, and tariffs on China did not come as a surprise. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=619.18s)]
*  Of course, triple digit tariffs is hard to stomach for China. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=623.62s)]
*  But when it comes to the other economies in Asia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, many of [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=628.42s)]
*  whom are seen as key allies to the US, big investors in the United States, it was a shock [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=634.4599999999999s)]
*  to them to be on the receiving end. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=640.62s)]
*  So now all those governments, I assume, are hoping to broker a good deal before the 90 [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=642.26s)]
*  days is up. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=648.26s)]
*  Well, the Japanese government couldn't quite believe it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=649.26s)]
*  Their position was, we are the biggest investor worldwide into the United States. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=653.34s)]
*  This isn't really how you should treat the biggest investor into your country, an erstwhile [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=658.66s)]
*  ally as well, coming in with 25% of tariffs. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=663.74s)]
*  So there's been a pause there. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=668.9399999999999s)]
*  They obviously want to avoid tariffs as much as possible. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=671.48s)]
*  Manufacturing is such an important part of their economy. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=675.2s)]
*  But there's another problem now, Sally, and that is if China isn't able to sell to the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=678.2s)]
*  United States, where is it going to sell? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=683.88s)]
*  Is it then going to start dumping lots of cheap goods onto other countries? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=687.12s)]
*  So this is kind of like a secondary ricochet effect of this trade war. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  So manufacturers in places, well, here in Southeast Asia, Vietnam and Thailand, Cambodia [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=695.44s)]
*  and so on, they're kind of bracing themselves from an influx deluge of goods coming from [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=702.24s)]
*  China that could put noses out of joint when it comes to domestic manufacturing, domestic [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=706.72s)]
*  jobs as well. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=711.72s)]
*  We know that Europe is kind of bracing itself for a similar secondary effect. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=712.96s)]
*  So this is just one aspect of a much wider ranging series of knock-on effects from this [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=717.6s)]
*  trade war. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=724.44s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=725.44s)]
*  Nick, thank you so much. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=726.44s)]
*  Nick Marsh there in Singapore for us. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRyXICjQV20&t=727.44s)]
