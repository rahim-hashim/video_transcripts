Video Description: Pope Francis had a "peaceful" night and was rested, the Vatican said, after revealing on Saturday that his condition continues to be "critical".

The pontiff was described as "more unwell" than on Friday and he has received blood transfusions as he suffers from a "prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis".

The 88-year-old is being treated for pneumonia in both lungs at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome.

The blood transfusions were deemed necessary due to a low platelet count, associated with anaemia, the Vatican said.

# Pope Francis has 'peaceful' night after condition described as 'critical' | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0)
*  Hello, I'm Lauren Taylor. We start with the latest on the health of the Pope. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=0.0s)]
*  In the last hour, the Vatican has issued a brief update on Pope Francis, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  who's in a critical condition in hospital in Rome. It said he'd had a peaceful night and was rested. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Well, these are the live pictures from the Gemelli Hospital in Rome, where the Pope [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=14.08s)]
*  has been for more than a week now being treated for a double pneumonia. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=17.6s)]
*  He's been given oxygen and blood transfusions. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=21.28s)]
*  Well-wishers have been leaving candles, flowers and letters outside hospital all week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  The weekly Vatican Mass is still taking place. This would normally be attended by Pope Francis. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=29.68s)]
*  And we understand that Archbishop Rino Fiskela, who's a senior Vatican official, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=38.08s)]
*  told participants at that Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on Sunday morning that they should [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=41.92s)]
*  make their prayers for Francis stronger and more intense. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=45.92s)]
*  Well, our Europe correspondent, Sarah Rainsford, gave us this update from Rome. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=50.16s)]
*  A very brief update from the Vatican, which is normal practice here for the past week or so. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=54.4s)]
*  They have been issuing a couple of lines every morning and then a more detailed statement, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=60.08s)]
*  usually in the evening. And this morning, it was simply to say that the night had passed peacefully [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=64.56s)]
*  and that the Pope had rested. They didn't say he'd rested well, but that he had rested. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=70.56s)]
*  I think that is some comfort perhaps for Catholics and Catholic commentators who are watching very, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=75.44s)]
*  very closely to see how the Pope is doing and see how he passed the night. Because, of course, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=80.8s)]
*  we had what one commentator described as an alarming update from the Vatican yesterday evening, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=85.6s)]
*  in which they talked about a prolonged respiratory attack that the Pope had suffered [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=91.52s)]
*  yesterday morning. They said he was given high flow oxygen, so oxygen directly into his nose. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=96.96s)]
*  Also, he had blood transfusions yesterday. We were told, again, a detail that we hadn't heard [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=104.16s)]
*  before, so new information. And I think, you know, in the spirit of what the Pope has asked for, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=108.72s)]
*  he has asked for the Vatican to be transparent about the state of his health. And we are told [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=114.0s)]
*  by his doctors that he knows it's serious. They've described it as critical. And indeed, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=119.44s)]
*  the Vatican yesterday evening also repeated that the Pope was still in a critical condition [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  and that he was still not out of danger. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAFdHGd7_B0&t=130.56s)]
