# What does the pope do? #Pope #CatholicChurch #Vatican #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8)
*  So we have a new pope, but what does that pope actually do? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=0.0s)]
*  All the many titles give us a clue. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=4.32s)]
*  One is very easy to explain, that it's sovereign of the Vatican City state. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=6.88s)]
*  The sovereign of that state has relations with other world leaders. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=12.4s)]
*  He meets his emissaries, I suppose, from around the world, 5,000 bishops. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=16.4s)]
*  A pope can also take up big global causes that he cares about. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=20.88s)]
*  In Pope Francis' case, it was poverty around the world, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=25.2s)]
*  it was climate change, and crucially for him, it was the dignity of migrants. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=28.88s)]
*  This sculpture was placed in St Peter's Square during his papacy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=34.32s)]
*  This is, after all, the government, the administration of the Catholic Church, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  and what the pope also does is run that administration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=42.64s)]
*  So you're talking about finances, you're talking about the way the administration, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=46.08s)]
*  the church deals with things like abuse. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=50.56s)]
*  And just so you know, the pope does have his accommodation and expenses paid for, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=53.44s)]
*  but doesn't actually take a salary from the Vatican. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=58.48s)]
*  Well, another of those official titles for the pope is successor to the Prince of Apostles, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=61.279999999999994s)]
*  and that of course points to the spiritual role that the pope plays. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei3F-g41rE8&t=67.44s)]
