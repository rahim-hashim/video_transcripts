# Flamengo football club: Ten die in Rio de Janeiro fire - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY)
*  Fire is reported to have killed 10 people and injured three more at the training ground of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=0.0s)]
*  one of Brazil's most successful football clubs, Flamengo. The fire broke out at the Ninho do [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=5.12s)]
*  Urubo facility in Rio de Janeiro in a building which houses the club's youth team players. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Let's speak now to Julia Caneiro, our correspondent in Rio. Julia, what do we know? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=16.8s)]
*  Well, this fire broke out overnight, Geeta. It seems to have been in the early hours of this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=22.32s)]
*  morning. This training facility is in the western part of Rio, and there are already [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=27.2s)]
*  families gathering there, anxious for information about the victims. The names of the people who [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=35.2s)]
*  were injured in the hospital, these are three young men, 15 and 14 years of age, have been [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  disclosed. But the names of those that have been killed by the fire, according to firefighters here [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=49.04s)]
*  in Rio, have not yet been made public. So, of course, there's huge anxiety from parts of the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=54.64s)]
*  families that had young boys living in those facilities. This is all a structure that belongs [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=59.92s)]
*  to Flamengo. This is the biggest football club in Rio. It's cherished by the city, and of course, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=68.88s)]
*  here it's a dream for young men to go into football. So, for them, this fire affected [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=75.76s)]
*  the dormitory of these youth categories of the team. So, young men who are being trained [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  to go up the ladder and hopefully make it into professional football in the future. So, it's not [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  any presumption to imagine that it's a dream come true for many of them being there. And this fire [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=100.88s)]
*  hit the dormitory of the youngest parts of the team, these categories that were being trained [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=107.44s)]
*  to be professional footballers of Flamengo. So, these are children. Terrible news, of course, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=115.36s)]
*  for their families. We know that the situation is still ongoing, Julia. Any word at all as to how [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=122.56s)]
*  this fire started? No, not yet. This will still be investigated. Firefighters are still at the scene [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=128.72s)]
*  working. The fire scene has been controlled, but we're still waiting for definitive numbers to see [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=137.28s)]
*  if there were any more victims. The families have now been ushered into the centre where the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=145.36s)]
*  directors of Flamengo are gathered, and there were lots of journalists there already asking [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=152.64s)]
*  them questions. So, in a way, this seems to be a means of protecting them and providing them more [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=157.52s)]
*  information about what's happening. And the team has not yet come out to speak to say what happened [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=163.68s)]
*  and how this happened. But it is a big shock that training facility, Gita, is referred to here as [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=169.68s)]
*  Ninho do Urubu, as you said. That means vulture's nest. And that's a reference to the mascot of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=176.96s)]
*  Flamengo, the vulture, which is sort of embraced by all the fans of the team. And it's a nest [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=183.6s)]
*  because, of course, it's fostering the futures of all the younger generation that are entering [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=188.72s)]
*  the team. And that, precisely, that nest has been affected by this dreadful fire. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  Very sad. Julia, thanks very much. Julia Cunheiro there in Rio. We will keep you updated on that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z_ajai09cY&t=200.95999999999998s)]
