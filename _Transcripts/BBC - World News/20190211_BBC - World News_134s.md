Video Description: Neither war nor the Islamic State group has stopped Abu Malek driving his 1952 classic car across Syria.
The 67-year-old DeSoto Powermaster is a bit worse for wear, but still works.
Fifty years ago, the petrol engine was switched for a British tractor engine.
Before the most recent war, when fuel was better quality, Abu Malwk says it could reach 140km per hour.
