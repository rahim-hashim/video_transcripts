*  But I think that's the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=0.0s)]
*  Mingling with the politicians as well and the tech bros, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8.0s)]
*  I mean, are we potentially seeing how technology can change the way [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13.0s)]
*  that the Health and Human Services Secretariat is dealt with [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18.0s)]
*  or defence or foreign policy? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23.0s)]
*  America spends far too much on its government. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26.0s)]
*  It spends far too much money. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=29.0s)]
*  And if Elon Musk can get this right, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=31.0s)]
*  the idea of making American government more efficient... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=34.0s)]
*  We can see George and Laura Bush entering here as well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=37.0s)]
*  Although no Michelle Obama. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=40.0s)]
*  No Michelle Obama, indeed. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=41.0s)]
*  She has decided to stay in Hawaii. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=42.0s)]
*  Better weather. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=45.0s)]
*  Way better weather. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=46.0s)]
*  But one suspects maybe that she decided not to be here for other reasons as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=47.0s)]
*  But that's something that we've got to remember about today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=50.0s)]
*  It is a celebration for everybody in the Trump team and for Republicans, of course, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=53.0s)]
*  but it's also a public declaration of the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=56.0s)]
*  We saw the president and the president-elect travel in the same vehicle to come here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=63.0s)]
*  Barack Obama there entering on his own. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=69.0s)]
*  Solo. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=72.0s)]
*  Yeah, without her. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=73.0s)]
*  Joe Biden did not invite Donald Trump and Melania Trump to the White House for tea [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=75.0s)]
*  because he likes Donald Trump. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=82.0s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=84.0s)]
*  He invited him there to show respect to the process. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=85.0s)]
*  Joe Biden's an institutionalist. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=88.0s)]
*  He invited Barack Obama is there today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=90.0s)]
*  George Bush is there today. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=93.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton is there today. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=95.0s)]
*  Out of respect for the American process and to remind the world that unlike four years ago, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=97.0s)]
*  there will be a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=103.0s)]
*  And it's a way of saying, we've got this, we're back. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=107.0s)]
*  It's stable again. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=109.0s)]
*  Apple CEO there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=110.0s)]
*  He is also in attendance part of that coterie of Silicon Valley big wigs. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=112.0s)]
*  Also here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=118.0s)]
*  It's quite a collection here that the president-elect has managed to get together. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=120.0s)]
*  And everyone wanting to make it clear that they're going to be behind it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=127.0s)]
*  We talked a little bit about the tech side of this, the business advances that could happen under this administration. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=131.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was also elected in a way to change America culturally. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=137.0s)]
*  He's spoken about this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=141.0s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg has spoken about this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=142.0s)]
*  Elon Musk has spoken about this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=144.0s)]
*  We're going to get all of those executive orders today, ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in American businesses, in the American government. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=146.0s)]
*  There's a pushback against the Me Too movement, against the Black Lives Matter movement. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=154.0s)]
*  And we're seeing a swing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=158.0s)]
*  America swings back. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=159.0s)]
*  Ronald Reagan in the 1980s was a pushback against the civil rights movement. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=160.0s)]
*  We don't know how long the pushback will last, but this is definitely a moment where you've got American business and American politicians [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=164.0s)]
*  in the MAGA movement saying, OK, that's enough with the Wokery. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=170.0s)]
*  We heard Mark Zuckerberg say we need more masculine energy in American business. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=174.0s)]
*  You look around that room, that's what people are talking about. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=179.0s)]
*  That's what's exciting American businesses and MAGA supporters today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=181.0s)]
*  RFK Junior there on screen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=184.0s)]
*  Elon Musk there chatting with some of the big donors to the Trump campaign. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=186.0s)]
*  Elon Musk, the biggest donor of all. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=191.0s)]
*  Indeed, indeed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=192.0s)]
*  Some of the, well, three or four of the richest men on earth are in that room. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah, and they want to get close to Donald Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=198.0s)]
*  Elon Musk has $10 billion worth of contracts with the American government. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=200.0s)]
*  It does him, serves him extremely well to have that close relationship. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=204.0s)]
*  Jeff Bezos is there because he's trying to catch up with Elon Musk to get those American government contracts, which are worth billions of dollars. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=208.0s)]
*  That's why they are there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=214.0s)]
*  But for the rest of the world watching this, it's who is really in control of this government? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=216.0s)]
*  Where is the power center in America right now? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=222.0s)]
*  And who do you have to cozy up to? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=225.0s)]
*  Who do you have to donate money to in order to get your countries and your industries' voices heard? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=226.0s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg there also on the screen to the left. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=234.0s)]
*  But Cathy, thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=239.0s)]
*  Well, let's just to give you an idea of what is going to be happening in the next sort of 40, 45 minutes or so. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=241.0s)]
*  The first to be sworn in will be the Vice President JD Vance. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=249.0s)]
*  And the aim is that Donald Trump should be sworn in as the 47th president of the United States at 1147 U.S. time. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=253.0s)]
*  So 45 minutes to go until he becomes president for the second time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=264.0s)]
*  And Sarah, watching his family have just started arriving, we saw Eric Trump's wife, Lara Trump, arrive a moment ago. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=270.0s)]
*  It is an extraordinary array of people. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=278.0s)]
*  This is the ceremony, the formality. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=280.0s)]
*  But midday, he's really going to start getting down to business, isn't he? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=283.0s)]
*  Because he's already giving us quite a stark idea of the sort of things that he is going to carry out in these 100 or so executive orders. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=294.0s)]
*  Midday, he has the power to start signing these executive orders. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=295.0s)]
*  And after he has made his inaugural remarks, he will go to the Capital One Arena where his supporters are waiting for him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=298.0s)]
*  And as Gary was telling us, there's a desk set up there for him to start signing these orders. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=304.0s)]
*  And they will cover some of the biggest promises he made on the campaign, on immigration. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=309.0s)]
*  He wants to end birthright citizenship. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=314.0s)]
*  Just because you're born in America doesn't mean you would be a citizen anymore. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=316.0s)]
*  And declare a national emergency on the border. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=320.0s)]
*  That would mean he can send troops to the border to stop people coming across. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=322.0s)]
*  Supreme Court justices there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=327.0s)]
*  Yes, the Supreme Court justices. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=329.0s)]
*  And two of them are the people who will swear in both JD Vance and the president. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=331.0s)]
*  There's Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who are going to be taking, doing that and reading the oath with JD Vance and the president. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=338.0s)]
*  All of these justices will be very important during this administration because once President Trump has signed all of these executive orders, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=351.0s)]
*  some of them will be challenged legally and could end up being ruled on by the Supreme Court where there is a conservative majority of nine to six. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=357.0s)]
*  Thanks to some of the appointments Donald Trump made the last time he was president. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=366.0s)]
*  They've almost always ruled in Donald Trump's favor when a case has come before them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=369.0s)]
*  So he will be expecting them to try and uphold some of the things that he does as president. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=373.0s)]
*  And he is really he's saying that he wants to do this. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=378.0s)]
*  This is a sort of shock and awe tactic today, isn't it? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=381.0s)]
*  We are going to see so many executive orders that he will sign. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=383.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Not just immigration on energy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=387.0s)]
*  He will sign things allowing people to start drilling for oil across the Alaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve and all kinds of other things to try and increase energy production. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=389.0s)]
*  And also restoring sanity, he says he's going to do. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=400.0s)]
*  That would be ending these diversity and inclusion rules and laws that there are within the government. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=405.0s)]
*  He says it will go back to a point that's being made on merit. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=410.0s)]
*  But also crucially, he will decree that there are two sexes in America, men and women, and that these are not changeable. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=413.0s)]
*  That will do things like deny trans athletes taking part in women's sports, but could have an impact right across society. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=421.0s)]
*  I heard a Republican strategist yesterday saying in America we are tired of being woke and broke. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=426.0s)]
*  But that's really you know, he fought that on that kept for his campaign. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=432.0s)]
*  Yes, certainly. I mean, the economy was what swung it for most voters who really do genuinely under Donald Trump. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=436.0s)]
*  Let's see how long it takes for him to deliver. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=441.0s)]
*  All he's saying today is we're going to bring the prices down. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=443.0s)]
*  He's not giving many details on what he's going to be doing on that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=445.0s)]
*  No, he's going to sign an order against inflation, but that's not necessarily going to bring inflation down in any regard. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=447.0s)]
*  But he can deliver on the anti woke agenda almost immediately. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=453.0s)]
*  And the more actions he takes on that, the more he'll keep his base happy and perhaps the longer they will give him to try and bring prices down. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=458.0s)]
*  So they are gathering expected to take a begin in just a few minutes time. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=465.0s)]
*  Faces from right across the political spectrum, their cabinet nominees. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=472.0s)]
*  We've seen Marco Rubio. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=478.0s)]
*  We've seen we've seen over this Mark Zuckerberg in there from Mesa. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=480.0s)]
*  We've seen Pete Hegseth, whose Trump's nominee for defense. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=486.0s)]
*  And that is what he will do immediately after the swearing swearing of the oath. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=490.0s)]
*  He will go into the president's room as a signing ceremony. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=495.0s)]
*  And he is going to officially name his nominees. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=498.0s)]
*  Now, here are the Trump children, the five Trump children, the tallest at the back, the youngest Baron Trump. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=503.0s)]
*  But we've got Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Trump, who are all here with their families, their children. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=508.0s)]
*  What role will they be playing in this new administration? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=517.0s)]
*  Ivanka was very prominent last time. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=520.0s)]
*  She was. She was. She and her husband, Derek Cushman, were both very closely involved and they've taken a step back now. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=522.0s)]
*  They took almost no part in the campaign whatsoever and don't want to be in the White House. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=527.0s)]
*  And Eric Trump largely runs the Trump businesses, so is likely to be less involved in politics. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=532.0s)]
*  Eric, though, was a big campaign advisor and clearly extremely interested in politics, very close to JD Vance. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=537.0s)]
*  So he will doubtless be working with him and trying to make sure that his voice is heard within this administration. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=543.0s)]
*  And Baron Trump, he was 10 last time he attended the inauguration ceremony for his father. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=548.0s)]
*  He's now grown somewhat. He's now six foot seven, I think he is. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=553.0s)]
*  Six foot nine, I think. Six foot nine. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=557.0s)]
*  So he's going to be splitting his time between here and New York. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=558.0s)]
*  But he did play a part in the campaign, didn't he? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=561.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a student at New York University now. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=563.0s)]
*  So, yeah, presumably he'll be in New York most of the time during term. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=567.0s)]
*  He was a big advisor on social media strategy. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=570.0s)]
*  He was the one who persuaded Donald Trump to speak to a number of prominent right wing podcasters and also to go on TikTok. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=572.0s)]
*  It's largely by his influence, it would appear, that Donald Trump is going to overturn the ban on TikTok in the United States. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=578.0s)]
*  He thinks it was politically useful and it was Baron who turned him on to that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=584.0s)]
*  There is actually going to be one Democrat speaking at what is essentially a Republican event, I suppose, Amy Klobuchar, Senator. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=593.0s)]
*  She is the head of the bipartisan inaugural committee, again trying to get across the important fact that this is a peaceful transfer of power [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=602.0s)]
*  and also what Democrats she will actually be kicking off the proceedings once the marching band has finished playing at the top of the event here, which should be getting underway in the next few minutes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=614.0s)]
*  They're running a little bit late, we understand. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=626.0s)]
*  But there you go. The head of Apple there, Tim Cook, taking up his seat. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=630.0s)]
*  I also actually saw the head of FIFA, Gianni Fantini, also in the crowd there. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=635.0s)]
*  The World Cup is actually coming to the Americas, so that perhaps explains his presence here at this event. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=642.0s)]
*  The band is striking up there. We're going to go to Sumi Somerskanda, my colleague who's at the Russell building, not far from where this event is taking place, Sumi. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=650.0s)]
*  It looks as if pretty much everyone has arrived who should have arrived. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=660.0s)]
*  Indeed, Clive. And, you know, this was a coveted spot to get in the rotunda as they moved the ceremonies from outside to inside. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=667.0s)]
*  People battling for spots, of course. We're seeing Lara Trump entering now, the wife of Eric Trump and also Jared Kushner entering there. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=675.0s)]
*  Now, Lara Trump, of course, for some time was the chair of the Republican National Committee. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=684.0s)]
*  There was some speculation after she left that role that she could possibly run for an open Senate seat in Florida, the one that was left absent by Marco Rubio, of course, becoming Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=689.0s)]
*  Jared Kushner, of course, played a large role, Clive, as you know, in the first term for Donald Trump. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=704.0s)]
*  You see him here now leaning over and speaking to, looks like, Jeff Bezos there and also Sundar Pichai as well, the CEO of Google. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=709.0s)]
*  So he is here taking a spot there in the front row, but just goes to show Mark Zuckerberg right behind him as well, just show the concentration of power, if you will, right there in those rows, the Donald Trump family and, of course, the titans of the tech industry. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=718.0s)]
*  And we see some of those Trump cabinet picks. Interesting. We saw his incoming national security adviser a short while ago getting up to take pictures for them as well. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=734.0s)]
*  An extremely historic moment. And this is a bipartisan event. Let's listen in. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=743.0s)]

*  Cathy, for those Republicans who felt the previous election was stolen, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1202.0s)]
*  who were angry that these scenes didn't take place four years ago, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1210.0s)]
*  is this finally for them the event that they believe should have happened a long time ago? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1216.0s)]
*  Yeah, and there are still some Trump supporters who insist that the 2020 election was stolen, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1223.0s)]
*  even though there is no evidence to support that, who felt that he should have been the person who took power. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1230.0s)]
*  I think this is almost more of a vindication this time around, as you suggested, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1236.0s)]
*  because of the broad swathe of his support. You look at all of the data, he did better amongst Hispanics, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1241.0s)]
*  he did better amongst African Americans, he did better amongst young people, he won the popular vote. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1246.0s)]
*  So by expanding his support this time around, and who knows whether he could have done that in 2020, he didn't. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1252.0s)]
*  I think that's why you get this triumphal mood in Washington today, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1258.0s)]
*  which is so different from the mood when I was here in 2017, covering the first inauguration. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1262.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're just seeing some of the congressional leaders from both parties there on the screen. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1268.0s)]
*  And yes, you're right, it's that span of support that I think he believes [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1274.0s)]
*  gives him the opportunity to come in hard on day one with 400, 200, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1280.0s)]
*  however many executive orders that he's going to push through. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1285.0s)]
*  Potentially calling the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, as of today. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1289.0s)]
*  I mean, let's see whether he actually has the tools of government to get it done. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1293.0s)]
*  The Republican staff director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, Ms. Emily Leviner, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1297.0s)]
*  the Senate secretary for the minority, the Honorable Gary Myrick, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1303.0s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1337.0s)]
*  As the event continues, they're actually about 20 minutes late. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1367.0s)]
*  So things running a little bit behind. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1384.0s)]
*  But that doesn't really matter, does it, Cathy, for the Republicans and for Donald Trump supporters? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1388.0s)]
*  They've waited four years for this. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1394.0s)]
*  They've waited four years and they're very excited. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1395.0s)]
*  I had a conversation this weekend, Clive, with somebody who had been a senior official in the first Trump administration. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1397.0s)]
*  And he said, watch the Trump family tomorrow, because in Trump's ideal world, it is President Donald Trump, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1403.0s)]
*  and then it is President Don Trump Jr., and then it's President Barron Trump. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1409.0s)]
*  And it is going to be the Trump dynasty. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1413.0s)]
*  And that is what this president would like more than anything else. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1415.0s)]
*  It's not the Bush dynasty. He would like to do better than the Bush dynasty. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1417.0s)]
*  He'd like to do better than the Bush dynasty. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1420.0s)]
*  But is that really what's going through his mind now? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1422.0s)]
*  He's thinking, right, OK, a few years time, it'll be Don Jr. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1424.0s)]
*  You know how Washington works, Clive. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1428.0s)]
*  The moment he is sworn into office, the conversation switches in some senses from Donald Trump to who's next. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1430.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1436.0s)]
*  It's a brutal town. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1437.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1438.0s)]
*  And the conversation will be about what is the future of the Republican Party and who is the leader of that future Republican Party. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1439.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has $500 million sitting in coffers. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1445.0s)]
*  So he has a certain amount of sway just because he's amassed a fortune from all of those tech billionaires that we were talking about earlier. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1448.0s)]
*  So he can direct the process. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1454.0s)]
*  He would like to be able to control the process. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1456.0s)]
*  I don't know if he has Don Jr. in mind, but he would like to be able to control the process. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1458.0s)]
*  But the process will begin and he will not be at the center of the conversation. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1462.0s)]
*  In two years time after those midterm elections, the Republican leadership train leaves the station and Donald Trump's standing on the platform. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1466.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1473.0s)]
*  And he would obviously, of course, love his legacy to continue on once he leaves. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1474.0s)]
*  Let's listen in a bit more. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1479.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1504.0s)]
*  And we're awaiting now the arrival of JD Vance's wife and the. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1523.0s)]
*  First lady to be Melania Trump, the Eric Vance, one of Donald Trump's. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1551.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, Jr. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1556.0s)]
*  In fact, the Baron Trump and the full family gathered there in the Capitol rotunda. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1559.0s)]
*  These timings are running slightly over what we were expecting. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1567.0s)]
*  And the ambition is that Donald Trump should be sworn in as president of the United States for a second time at eleven forty seven. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1572.0s)]
*  And JD Vance should be sworn in first any moment now. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1583.0s)]
*  First lady there, Jill Biden, watching on. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1587.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton there in the center of the screen. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1598.0s)]
*  I mean, you shouldn't forget, of course, we're expecting the vice president to arrive at some point. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1602.0s)]
*  This was not to be when it comes to a first woman president. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1613.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton fought that fight, didn't win. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1619.0s)]
*  And Ms. Harris fought that fight, didn't win. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1624.0s)]
*  Why do you think we're in that kind of situation where a woman can't seem to get to the top? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1626.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton tried. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1635.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris tried. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1637.0s)]
*  How much did the fact that they were both women impede their chances? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1638.0s)]
*  Does it mean that the Democratic Party will be reluctant to nominate another woman? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1642.0s)]
*  I think it may well be. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1646.0s)]
*  It could well mean that our first female president in the United States is a Republican and not a Democrat. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1647.0s)]
*  Since we've had two Democrat women tried and failed. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1652.0s)]
*  I think both of those women would tell you and I've spoken to both of them about this, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1655.0s)]
*  that there is an element in the country that is reluctant to vote for something they haven't had before. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1660.0s)]
*  So you're asking somebody to vote for us. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1665.0s)]
*  We've had a succession of men over two hundred and fifty years in America. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1667.0s)]
*  It's a lot to ask people to vote for something they haven't had before. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1672.0s)]
*  They voted for Barack Obama, but are they prepared to vote for a woman? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1675.0s)]
*  They're all here today, of course, though. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1678.0s)]
*  They are all. One noticeable aspect, we spoke about Michelle Obama, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1680.0s)]
*  and actually there's some question about whether she's in Hawaii. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1683.0s)]
*  I wonder whether she's down the road at her house in Calorama in D.C., not watching this. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1685.0s)]
*  The other person who's not there is Karen Pence. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1689.0s)]
*  Mike Pence walked in alone. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1691.0s)]
*  Karen Pence, a little bit like Michelle Obama, feels that Donald Trump put her own family in danger. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1693.0s)]
*  She said this. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1699.0s)]
*  And she is furious with the former president and she didn't want to be here either. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1700.0s)]
*  And that was a noticeable absence as well. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1703.0s)]
*  Well, Mike Pence, of course, the only person, senior person from the previous Trump administration, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1705.0s)]
*  who was there when Joe Biden was sworn in, he turned up at the inauguration. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1710.0s)]
*  His boss didn't, a tutionalist, and decided that he needed to be there. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1714.0s)]
*  And there we see Joe Biden and the first gentleman waiting, second gentleman, I should say, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1721.0s)]
*  waiting for those people who will succeed them. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1729.0s)]
*  And it's going to be an interesting next four years as we look on this presidency, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1737.0s)]
*  as we talked a lot about the tech bros who were in there, the money, the wealth. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1743.0s)]
*  But it's millions and millions, 77 million ordinary Americans who voted for Donald Trump. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1748.0s)]
*  And we should never forget that across a whole range of demographics. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1754.0s)]
*  Yes, and the Trump campaign, very keen to project an image that they have a huge man state. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1758.0s)]
*  And here we have Melania Trump walking out, looking elegant as ever, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1766.0s)]
*  different outfit from first time around. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1771.0s)]
*  I'm always fascinated by Melania Trump's outfits, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1773.0s)]
*  partly because she chooses them very carefully to project an image and to project a message. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1775.0s)]
*  Arshia Vance as well, just gone through the, across the picture there. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1780.0s)]
*  She was actually a clerk for Brett Kavanaugh, who's going to swear in her husband as vice president. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1784.0s)]
*  And there's Melania now entering the rotunda. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1792.0s)]
*  The only hat I've seen, I think. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1797.0s)]
*  Ivanka Trump has a little green hat on. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1800.0s)]
*  A little green hat, a fascinator. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1804.0s)]
*  Yes, I'm glad I'm following the fashion for each life. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1806.0s)]
*  Somebody has to keep tabs on the important moments of the day. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1809.0s)]
*  Someone has to. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1812.0s)]
*  But, you know, it's, again, going back to the importance of the economy in this election, for instance. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1813.0s)]
*  You know, the people that I talked to on the road covering the election for several weeks leading up to polling day. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1820.0s)]
*  You know, the fact that the current administration presided over 9% inflation. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1827.0s)]
*  The fact that gas prices were going through the roof. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1834.0s)]
*  These are the basic things that ordinary Americans voted for, and this room represents some of the richest people on the planet. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1838.0s)]
*  And can they bring down those prices? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1845.0s)]
*  We're going to have all of these executive orders signed in the next few hours by Donald Trump. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1848.0s)]
*  But it looks like the one we may not have is on tariffs. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1853.0s)]
*  Because that could push up prices. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1856.0s)]
*  Oh, America, you're calling. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1868.0s)]
*  I can hear you calling me. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1888.0s)]
*  You are calling me to pay. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1895.0s)]
*  True to thee, true to thee, I will be. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1900.0s)]
*  Oh, America, no weeping. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1909.0s)]
*  Let there be no wounded mind. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1916.0s)]
*  I will keep you in my keeping till there be a new start. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1923.0s)]
*  I know your hands can reach to the sky. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1938.0s)]
*  I know candles can reach to the sky. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1951.0s)]
*  Walking into the rotunda now. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1964.0s)]
*  President Biden, still President Biden, for the last few moments, and his Vice President, Kamala Harris. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1967.0s)]
*  And through this land, you are beautiful to me. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1979.0s)]
*  Oh, America, you're calling. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1990.0s)]
*  I can hear you calling me. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=1996.0s)]
*  Jade Evans approaching the rotunda. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2003.0s)]
*  Jade Evans will be the first to be sworn in, the first to take the oath of office. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2008.0s)]
*  It will be administered by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2014.0s)]
*  Jade Evans, just 40 years old. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2018.0s)]
*  You are beautiful to me. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2032.0s)]
*  Oh, America, you're calling. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2054.0s)]
*  I will ever answer thee. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2064.0s)]
*  We're getting very close to the moment now. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2084.0s)]
*  The congressional leadership of the Senate and the House. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2092.0s)]

*  Vindication for him. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2151.0s)]
*  And the only man to retake the White House after a pause in almost 130 years. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2153.0s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2541.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2569.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2594.0s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2609.0s)]
*  Please welcome the Chairwoman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, the Honorable Amy Klobuchar. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2639.0s)]
*  Good morning, everyone. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2660.0s)]
*  Welcome to the 60th Presidential Inauguration. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2662.0s)]
*  Today, President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Vance will take their oaths of office, and we will witness the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democracy. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2667.0s)]
*  This past year, I've chaired the Inaugural Ceremony Committee, which includes the leadership of Congress from both parties, staff and law enforcement who worked so hard over the last year, and especially the last three days. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2688.0s)]
*  You've done a beautiful job, and you have shown grace under pressure. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2704.0s)]
*  Our theme this year is our enduring democracy. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2716.0s)]
*  The presence of so many presidents and vice presidents here today is truly a testament to that endurance. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2720.0s)]
*  We welcome President Biden and Dr. Biden. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2728.0s)]
*  We welcome Vice President Harris and Doug Emhoff, President Obama, President Clinton and Secretary Clinton, President Bush and Laura Bush, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2732.0s)]
*  Vice President Pence, Vice President Quayle and Marilyn Quayle. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2742.0s)]
*  The justices of the United States Supreme Court are with us, all nine of them, I counted, and of course, the Trump and Vance families. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2747.0s)]
*  This ceremony marks what will soon be 250 years of our democracy. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2758.0s)]
*  It is the moment when leaders elevated by the will of the people promise to be faithful to our Constitution, to cherish and defend it. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2765.0s)]
*  It is the moment when they become, as we all should be, the guardians of our country. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2775.0s)]
*  Through war and peace, through adversity and prosperity, we hold this inauguration every four years, and today it falls on Martin Luther King Day, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2781.0s)]
*  a further reminder that we must strive to uphold the values enshrined in our Constitution, the freedoms, the liberties, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2793.0s)]
*  and, as is inscribed on the entrance of the United States Supreme Court, equal justice under law. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2802.0s)]
*  But what makes this moment more than a passing ceremony is all who are watching it across the country, the people of this nation, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2810.0s)]
*  the ordinary people doing extraordinary things. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2826.0s)]
*  President Kennedy, who at one point worked as a senator in this building and would often walk through this very rotunda, once said, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2830.0s)]
*  in a democracy, every citizen, regardless of interest in politics, holds office. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2839.0s)]
*  Every one of us is in a position of responsibility. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2845.0s)]
*  With that responsibility of citizenship comes an obligation not to seek out malice, as President Lincoln once reminded us, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2850.0s)]
*  but to view others with a generosity of spirit, despite our differences. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2859.0s)]
*  With that responsibility of leadership comes an obligation to stand our ground when we must and find common ground when we can. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2864.0s)]
*  With everything swirling around us, the hot mess of division, it is on all of us to quote an incredible songwriter who just happened to be born in my state, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2874.0s)]
*  to ensure that our nation's democracy is our shelter from the storm. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2885.0s)]
*  There's a reason this ceremony takes place at the Capitol. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2892.0s)]
*  In other countries, it might be in a presidential palace or a gilded executive office building. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2897.0s)]
*  Here it is traditionally held at the Capitol, the people's house. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2903.0s)]
*  It is a fitting reminder of the system of checks and balances that is the very foundation of our government, three equal branches of government. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2907.0s)]
*  That is how, for nearly 250 years, our great American experiment, grounded in the rule of law, has endured. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2919.0s)]
*  So as we inaugurate a new president and vice president, let us remember that the power of those in this room comes from the people, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2929.0s)]
*  the construction workers who build our country, the teachers and health care workers who nurture us, the troops defending our freedoms, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2942.0s)]
*  and yes, the firefighters in Los Angeles putting themselves on the line for us. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2951.0s)]
*  Our democracy's strength and grit must match theirs. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2968.0s)]
*  May God bless our nation. Thank you. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2974.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. Endurance through the years is the ultimate test. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=2981.0s)]
*  To persevere through time is the truest measure of an idea, an institution, and a nation. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3006.0s)]
*  Our founders wrote the Constitution so that America could withstand all the twists and turns of time. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3016.0s)]
*  They wrote it to guide us and to preserve forever our right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3026.0s)]
*  But as much as the truths and principles enshrined in our Constitution remain the same, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3036.0s)]
*  our democracy promises the American people the power to change, to chart their own destiny. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3044.0s)]
*  That's the beauty. That is the importance of democracy. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3053.0s)]
*  It allows the endurance, the permanence of a nation through change. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3059.0s)]
*  It allows nations like our United States both to avoid the obstacles and to seize the opportunities God has placed before us, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3067.0s)]
*  always staying true to our founding principles. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3079.0s)]
*  Today is our country's 60th inauguration ceremony. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3084.0s)]
*  Like all the others before it, it is a celebration of our right to set our uniquely American course. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3090.0s)]
*  The past several years have been trying at times for many, many Americans, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3099.0s)]
*  and also for the nations of the free world that we humbly strive to lead. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3105.0s)]
*  In November, Americans chose again to steer this nation towards greatness, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3112.0s)]
*  the secure, safe, and prosperous future that our founders envisioned for all of us. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3119.0s)]
*  And today we celebrate not only their decision to do so, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3128.0s)]
*  but also the simple right and wisdom of a free people to make their own choice so that their nation might endure. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3134.0s)]
*  And now allow me to welcome Archbishop Timothy Dolan and Reverend Franklin Graham, who will deliver our invocation. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3146.0s)]
*  Please rise. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3156.0s)]
*  Be still and know that I am God, supreme among the nations, supreme on the earth. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3169.0s)]
*  Let us pray. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3177.0s)]
*  Remembering General George Washington on his knees at Valley Forge, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3180.0s)]
*  recalling Abraham Lincoln at his second inaugural with malice toward none, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3186.0s)]
*  with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3192.0s)]
*  Remembering General George Patton's instructions to his soldiers as they began the Battle of the Bulge eight decades ago, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3198.0s)]
*  and the battle of the Bulge of the Great Wall. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3209.0s)]
*  Remembering General George Washington's words, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3214.0s)]
*  pray, pray when fighting, pray alone, pray with others, pray by night, pray by day. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3217.0s)]
*  Observing the birthday of the Reverend Martin Luther King, who warned, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3225.0s)]
*  without God our efforts turn to ashes. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3230.0s)]
*  We, blessed citizens of this one nation under God, humbled by our claim that in God we trust, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3235.0s)]
*  gather indeed this Inauguration Day to pray. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3243.0s)]
*  Donald J. Trump, his family, his advisors, his cabinet, his aspirations, his vice president. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3246.0s)]
*  For the Lord's blessings upon Joseph Biden, for our men and women in uniform, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3253.0s)]
*  for each other whose hopes are stoked this new year, this Inauguration Day. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3259.0s)]
*  We cannot err in relying upon that prayer from the Bible, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3266.0s)]
*  upon which our president will soon place his hand in oath, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3271.0s)]
*  as we make our own the supplications of King Solomon for wisdom, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3275.0s)]
*  as he began his governance. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3280.0s)]
*  God of our fathers, in your wisdom you set man to govern your creatures, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3283.0s)]
*  to govern in holiness and justice, to render justice with integrity. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3288.0s)]
*  Give our leader wisdom, for he is your servant, aware of his own weakness and brevity of life. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3293.0s)]
*  If wisdom which comes not from you be not with him, he shall be held in no esteem. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3300.0s)]
*  Send wisdom from heavens that she may be with him, that he may know your designs. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3306.0s)]
*  Please, God bless America, please mend her every flaw. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3313.0s)]
*  You are the God in whom we trust, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3321.0s)]
*  Mr. President, the last four years there are times I'm sure you thought, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3337.0s)]
*  but look what God has done. We praise him and give him glory. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3343.0s)]
*  Let us pray. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3358.0s)]
*  Our Father and our God, thou hast said, Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3361.0s)]
*  As the prophet Daniel prayed, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3368.0s)]
*  for wisdom and might are his. He changes the times and the seasons. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3373.0s)]
*  He removes kings. He raises up kings. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3379.0s)]
*  He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3383.0s)]
*  Our Father today, as President Donald J. Trump takes the oath of office once again, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3388.0s)]
*  we come to say thank you, O Lord our God. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3395.0s)]
*  Father, when Donald Trump's enemies thought he was down and out, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3399.0s)]
*  you and you alone saved his life and raised him up with strength and power by your mighty hand. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3404.0s)]
*  We pray for President Trump that you'll watch over, protect, guide, direct him. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3413.0s)]
*  Give him your wisdom from your throne on high. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3418.0s)]
*  We ask that you would bless him and that our nation would be blessed through him. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3423.0s)]
*  We also ask that you would bless and protect Melania as First Lady. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3428.0s)]
*  We thank you for the beauty, the warmth and grace that she shows not only to this nation, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3434.0s)]
*  but to the whole world. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3441.0s)]
*  We thank you for Vice President-elect JD Vance and his wife Usha and their young family. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3444.0s)]
*  May he be a strength to President Trump to stand beside him, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3451.0s)]
*  to hold up his arms like Aaron held up the arms of Moses in the midst of battle. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3455.0s)]
*  The prophet Samuel reminded the people, it was you that brought them up from the land of Egypt. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3460.0s)]
*  And he said, now stand still that I may reason with you before the Lord. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3466.0s)]
*  So Father, we take this moment to stand still, to remember the great things that you have done for this nation. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3472.0s)]
*  Thank you for the protection, the bounty, the freedoms that we so enjoy. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3479.0s)]
*  We remember to keep our eyes fixed on you. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3487.0s)]
*  And may our hearts be inclined to your voice. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3491.0s)]
*  We know that America can never be great again if we turn our backs on you. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3495.0s)]
*  We ask for your help. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3500.0s)]
*  And we pray all of this in the name of the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, your son, my Savior, and our Redeemer, Jesus Christ. Amen. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3502.0s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Associate Justice Kavanaugh to administer the Vice Presidential Oath of Office. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3512.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3525.0s)]
*  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3555.0s)]
*  I, James David Vance, do solemnly swear... [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3562.0s)]
*  I, James David Vance, do solemnly swear... [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3567.0s)]
*  That I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States... [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=3570.0s)]

*  The Golden Age of America begins right now. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4176.8s)]
*  From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4189.8s)]
*  We will be the envy of every nation and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4195.8s)]
*  During every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4204.8s)]
*  Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4221.8s)]
*  Our safety will be restored. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4224.8s)]
*  The scales of justice will be rebalanced. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4227.8s)]
*  The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4231.8s)]
*  And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4246.8s)]
*  And America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4258.8s)]
*  I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4271.8s)]
*  A tide of change is sweeping the country. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4280.8s)]
*  Sunlight is pouring over the entire world. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4282.8s)]
*  And America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4285.8s)]
*  But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4290.8s)]
*  While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4294.8s)]
*  As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4303.8s)]
*  For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4308.8s)]
*  while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4315.8s)]
*  We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4321.8s)]
*  while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4326.8s)]
*  It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4333.8s)]
*  but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4338.8s)]
*  many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4342.8s)]
*  We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4349.8s)]
*  but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4355.8s)]
*  Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4362.8s)]
*  as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina, who have been treated so badly, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4366.8s)]
*  and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4378.8s)]
*  or more recently Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4384.8s)]
*  from weeks ago without even a token of defense. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4389.8s)]
*  They're raging through the houses and communities, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4394.8s)]
*  even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4397.8s)]
*  some of whom are sitting here right now. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4402.8s)]
*  They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4405.8s)]
*  But we can't let this happen. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4409.8s)]
*  Everyone is unable to do anything about it that's going to change. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4412.8s)]
*  We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4418.8s)]
*  yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4422.8s)]
*  And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4427.8s)]
*  in many cases, to hate our country, despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4432.8s)]
*  All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4439.8s)]
*  My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4455.8s)]
*  and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4462.8s)]
*  and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed their freedom. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4467.8s)]
*  From this moment on, America's decline is over. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4475.8s)]
*  Our liberties and our nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4481.8s)]
*  and we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America's government. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4486.8s)]
*  Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4493.8s)]
*  I have been a member of the United States of America, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4500.8s)]
*  Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4504.8s)]
*  and I've learned a lot along the way. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4511.8s)]
*  The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4514.8s)]
*  Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom, and indeed to take my life. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4521.8s)]
*  Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4530.8s)]
*  But I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4537.8s)]
*  I was saved by God to make America great again. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4545.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4560.8s)]
*  That is why each day under our administration, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4580.8s)]
*  We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4590.8s)]
*  For American citizens, January 20th, 2025 is Liberation Day. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4602.8s)]
*  It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4619.8s)]
*  As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increase in support from virtually every element of our society, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4628.8s)]
*  young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural, and very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote we won by millions of people. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4649.8s)]
*  To the black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4673.8s)]
*  We set records and I will not forget it. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4684.8s)]
*  I've heard your voices in the campaign and I look forward to working with you in the years to come. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4688.8s)]
*  Today is Martin Luther King Day and his honor. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4694.8s)]
*  This will be a great honor, but in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4698.8s)]
*  We will make his dream come true. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4706.8s)]
*  National unity is now returning to America and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4728.8s)]
*  In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4738.8s)]
*  We will not forget our country. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4746.8s)]
*  We will not forget our Constitution and we will not forget our God. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4748.8s)]
*  I can't do that. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4756.8s)]
*  Today I will sign a series of historic with these actions. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4767.8s)]
*  We will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4771.8s)]
*  It's all about common sense. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4778.8s)]
*  First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4780.8s)]
*  All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4810.8s)]
*  We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4827.8s)]
*  I will end the practice of catch and release. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4833.8s)]
*  And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4841.8s)]
*  Under the orders I signed today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4852.8s)]
*  And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4882.8s)]
*  As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4913.8s)]
*  And that is exactly what I am going to do. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4921.8s)]
*  We will do it at a level that nobody's ever seen before. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4925.8s)]
*  Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4929.8s)]
*  The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4942.8s)]
*  And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4953.8s)]
*  We will drill, baby, drill. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4959.8s)]
*  America will be a manufacturing nation once again. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4972.8s)]
*  And we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4986.8s)]
*  And we are going to use it. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4994.8s)]
*  We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=4997.8s)]
*  We will be a rich nation again. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5017.8s)]
*  And it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5019.8s)]
*  With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5025.8s)]
*  In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5050.8s)]
*  We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5056.8s)]
*  And thank you to the auto workers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5063.8s)]
*  We did tremendously with their vote. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5069.8s)]
*  I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5074.8s)]
*  Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5082.8s)]
*  For this purpose, we are establishing the external revenue service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5098.8s)]
*  It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5110.8s)]
*  The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before to restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5117.8s)]
*  My administration will establish the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5126.8s)]
*  After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5145.8s)]
*  I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5152.8s)]
*  Where again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5178.8s)]
*  Something I know something about. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5185.8s)]
*  We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5188.8s)]
*  Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5192.8s)]
*  We will never go back to our cities. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5205.8s)]
*  This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5212.8s)]
*  We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5230.8s)]
*  As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5241.8s)]
*  This week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pain. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5269.8s)]
*  And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5292.8s)]
*  It's going to end immediately. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5301.8s)]
*  Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission, defeating America's enemies. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5307.8s)]
*  Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5337.8s)]
*  We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5347.8s)]
*  My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5377.8s)]
*  That's what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5383.8s)]
*  I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5386.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5416.8s)]
*  America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5419.8s)]
*  A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of Gulf of America and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5431.8s)]
*  President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5456.8s)]
*  He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5463.8s)]
*  The United States, I mean, think of this, spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5478.8s)]
*  We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5491.8s)]
*  And Panama's promise to us has been broken. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5496.8s)]
*  The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5500.8s)]
*  American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5505.8s)]
*  And that includes the United States Navy. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5515.8s)]
*  And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5518.8s)]
*  We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5524.8s)]
*  Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor and the vitality of history's greatest civilization. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5535.8s)]
*  So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5556.8s)]
*  We will not be deterred. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5563.8s)]
*  Together we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy and disease free. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5565.8s)]
*  The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5572.8s)]
*  builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5581.8s)]
*  And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5588.8s)]
*  Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5598.8s)]
*  And right now our nation is more ambitious than any other. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5620.8s)]
*  There's no nation like our nation. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5626.8s)]
*  Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs and pioneers. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5629.8s)]
*  The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5635.8s)]
*  The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5639.8s)]
*  Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5646.8s)]
*  No one comes close. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5658.8s)]
*  Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5660.8s)]
*  They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5667.8s)]
*  rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5674.8s)]
*  and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5684.8s)]
*  If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5690.8s)]
*  Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5697.8s)]
*  But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5704.8s)]
*  I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5727.8s)]
*  In America, the impossible is what we do best. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5734.8s)]
*  From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5739.8s)]
*  our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5756.8s)]
*  They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5766.8s)]
*  police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5772.8s)]
*  Together they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5781.8s)]
*  won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5789.8s)]
*  After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5799.8s)]
*  With your help, we will restore America's promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5806.8s)]
*  We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5815.8s)]
*  So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5820.8s)]

*  Thank you. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5834.8s)]
*  In recent years our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5854.8s)]
*  We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5863.8s)]
*  Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent and totally unpredictable. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5869.8s)]
*  America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith and goodwill. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5878.8s)]
*  We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong and we will win like never before. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5886.8s)]

*  From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5903.8s)]
*  We will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5909.8s)]
*  The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=5919.8s)]

*  Carrie Underwood, the country singer, is about to sing, coming at the end of quite a long second inaugural address from the new president, the 47th president, Donald Trump. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6055.8s)]
*  He talked about the golden age of America beginning right here, right now, will be the envy of every nation, he said. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6073.8s)]
*  And he's going to put America first. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6084.8s)]
*  And then he went through quite a long list of what he believed was wrong with America [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6087.8s)]
*  and what the last four years have yielded in terms of America going in several wrong directions. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6094.8s)]
*  But let's go back now and hear the voices. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6105.8s)]
*  The mountains and the majesties above the fruited plain. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6109.8s)]
*  America, America, God shed his grace on thee. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6120.8s)]
*  And crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6134.8s)]
*  So they managed to fix the audio there coming from the rotunda at the Capitol building. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6150.8s)]
*  And let's go back to events there. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6177.8s)]
*  I now call on Rabbi Ari Berman, Pastor Lorenzo Sewell, and Reverend Frank Munn to provide prayers of benediction. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6182.8s)]
*  Let us pray. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6212.8s)]
*  Almighty God, your prophet Jeremiah walked the streets of Jerusalem and blessed its inhabitants with the Hebrew words, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6217.8s)]

*  Thousands of years later, this great nation, which adopted these words as its motto, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6237.8s)]
*  In God we trust, stands at a moment of historic opportunity. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6243.8s)]
*  Americans are searching for meaning. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6250.8s)]
*  Our merciful Father, help us rise to meet this moment. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6254.8s)]
*  Bless President Donald J. Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance with the strength and courage to choose the right and the good. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6260.8s)]
*  Unite us around our foundational biblical values of life and liberty, of service and sacrifice, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6270.8s)]
*  And especially of faith and morality, which George Washington calls the indispensable support of American prosperity. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6280.8s)]
*  Guide our schools and college campuses, which have been experiencing such unrest, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6290.8s)]
*  To inspire the next generation to pair progress with purpose, knowledge with wisdom, and truth with virtue. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6297.8s)]
*  Hear the cry of the hostages, both American and Israeli, whose pain our president so acutely feels. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6308.8s)]
*  We are so thankful for the three young women who yesterday returned home, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6320.8s)]
*  And pray that the next four years bring peace to Israel and throughout the Middle East. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6327.8s)]
*  Almighty God, grant all Americans the opportunity to realize our shared dream of a life filled with peace and plenty, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6335.8s)]

*  Stir within us the confidence to rise to this moment, for while we trust in God, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6351.8s)]
*  God's trust is in us, the American people. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6359.8s)]
*  America is called to greatness, to be a beacon of light and a mover of history. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6364.8s)]
*  May our nation merit the fulfillment of Jeremiah's blessing, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6372.8s)]
*  That like a tree planted by water, we shall not cease to bear fruit. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6378.8s)]
*  May all of humanity experience your love and your blessing. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6383.8s)]
*  May it be thy will, and let us say, Amen. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6389.8s)]
*  Let us pray for our 47th president. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6397.8s)]
*  Heavenly Father, we're so grateful that you gave our 45th and now our 47th president a millimeter miracle. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6400.8s)]
*  We are grateful that you are the one that have called him for such a time as this, [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6409.8s)]
*  That America would begin to dream again. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6416.8s)]
*  We pray that we would fulfill the true meaning of our creed, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6421.8s)]
*  That we hold these truths to be self-evident, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6426.8s)]
*  That all men are created equal. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6430.8s)]
*  We pray that you use our president, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6434.8s)]
*  That we would live in a nation where we will not be judged by the color of our skin, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6437.8s)]
*  But by the content of our character. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6443.8s)]
*  Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus, we are so grateful today [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6448.8s)]
*  That you will use our 47th president, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6452.8s)]
*  So we would sing with new meaning, My country, tis of thee, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6457.8s)]
*  Sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing, [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6462.8s)]
*  Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims' pride, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6466.8s)]
*  From every mountainside, let freedom ring. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6471.8s)]
*  And because America is called to be a great nation, [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6475.8s)]
*  We believe that you will make this come true. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6479.8s)]
*  So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6483.8s)]
*  Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6489.8s)]

*  Let freedom ring from the curvaceous hilltops of California. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6504.8s)]
*  But God, we're asking you not only that, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6509.8s)]
*  Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain, Georgia. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6513.8s)]
*  Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6516.8s)]
*  Let freedom ring from every hill and every molehill in Mississippi, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6520.8s)]
*  From every state, every city, every village, and every hamlet. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6526.8s)]
*  And when we let freedom ring, we will be able to speed up that day [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6531.8s)]
*  Where all of your children, black men and white men, Protestant and Catholic, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6536.8s)]
*  Jew and Gentile, will be able to sing [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6541.8s)]
*  In the meaning of that old Negro spiritual, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6546.8s)]
*  Free at last, free at last. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6550.8s)]
*  Thank you, God Almighty. We are free at last. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6554.8s)]
*  If you believe what the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6558.8s)]
*  Come on, put your hands together and give your great God great glory. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6562.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6575.8s)]
*  Almighty and eternal God, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6591.8s)]
*  We gather here today in reverence, [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6594.8s)]
*  joined in our shared hopes and dreams for our beloved nation. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6597.8s)]
*  In this sacred moment of the inauguration of President Donald J. Trump [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6602.8s)]
*  and Vice President J. D. Vance, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6606.8s)]

*  Thank you for the freedoms we cherish, for the strength of our communities, [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6626.8s)]
*  and for the resilience of our cities. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6630.8s)]
*  Our President and Vice President embrace their newly appointed roles. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6632.8s)]
*  We humbly implore [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6636.8s)]
*  that your everlasting love and wisdom will envelop them. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6651.8s)]
*  Grant them the clarity of mind to navigate the challenges that lie ahead [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6657.8s)]
*  and the compassion to serve all citizens with fairness and integrity. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6662.8s)]
*  May their hearts be filled with a giving spirit [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6668.8s)]
*  and sincere understanding for those whom they represent. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6672.8s)]
*  May they be beacons of hope in times of uncertainty [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6676.8s)]
*  and how thesegov [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6681.8s)]
*  Ever awoken trumpet voices listening to our prayer [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6687.8s)]
*  and [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6690.8s)]
*  president, reflect the values of justice and peace. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6707.5s)]
*  As we embark on this new chapter, we also seek your comfort, O God, for those who feel [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6713.4s)]
*  lost or disheartened. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6719.76s)]
*  In this time of transition, may your light shine upon them, reaffirming their belief [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6723.08s)]
*  in a brighter tomorrow. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6730.42s)]
*  May we all strive to lift one another, supporting our fellow citizens with kindness and empathy, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6733.22s)]
*  recognizing that together we can overcome any adversity. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6739.860000000001s)]
*  Grant us the strength to endure, the courage to face our fears, and the clarity to see [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6744.5s)]
*  the light that remains even when clouds of uncertainty may gather. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6750.7s)]
*  Inspire our new leaders to be champions for the vulnerable and advocates for those whose [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6757.54s)]
*  voices are often silenced. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6763.9s)]
*  May they pursue policies that prove the well-being of all people. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6767.46s)]
*  With me is Cathy Kaye. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6771.86s)]
*  I want to go back to the politics, Cathy. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6772.86s)]
*  From what we heard in that second inaugural, how do you think the next four years are going [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6776.0199999999995s)]
*  to pan out? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6779.54s)]
*  Well, politics and religion mixed because at one point Donald Trump said that he was [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6780.54s)]
*  saved by God to make America great again. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6783.74s)]
*  That might be a line we remember. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6786.62s)]
*  The question is, how much of what he laid out, taking back the Panama Canal, which [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6787.94s)]
*  is one of the things, a new department of government, something that's very hard to [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6792.98s)]
*  do in the United States, how much of it that he's laid out today can he actually do? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6796.42s)]
*  How much will his team, which is actually an interestingly diverse ideological team [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6801.18s)]
*  in the cabinet, how much will they work together to get this done? [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6807.54s)]
*  How much will they be blocked by courts? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6810.1s)]
*  It's been a very busy few minutes. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6811.9s)]
*  There are already three lawsuits that have been launched against the new Trump administration [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6813.3s)]
*  just since Donald Trump was inaugurated. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6817.34s)]
*  So we're going to see the courts stepping in. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6819.78s)]
*  You're going to see the markets watching what he does around tariffs. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6822.42s)]
*  And then you're going to watch his team and how much can you actually change the American [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6825.860000000001s)]
*  government? [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6829.38s)]
*  It's an ambitious agenda that he's pointed out. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6830.38s)]
*  We talked about the Gilded Age. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6831.7s)]
*  He talked about the Golden Age. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6833.3s)]
*  And indeed, in the short term, he's announced he's going to declare a national emergency [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6834.820000000001s)]
*  at the southern border. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6839.900000000001s)]
*  He's going to have mass deportations beginning as soon as possible. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6842.18s)]
*  It sounds as if it's the American carnage speech from last time. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6847.9400000000005s)]
*  Without some of the darkness, we've been told that this would not be as dark as the 2017 [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6854.700000000001s)]
*  speech. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6859.22s)]
*  And I don't think there was that one line that we all remember about American carnage. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6860.22s)]
*  He did talk about the things he said. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6864.26s)]
*  I think it will be annihilated if it doesn't do more, that the government confronts a crisis [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6867.66s)]
*  of trust. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6873.7s)]
*  The government can't manage a single crisis at home. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6874.7s)]
*  I mean, there was Joe Biden sitting there. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6876.54s)]
*  And this was not certainly laudatory of Joe Biden or in any way polite towards Joe Biden. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6878.34s)]
*  But there are a lot of people who will look at the list of things he's done. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6883.66s)]
*  And you look at the polls even over the course of this weekend, Plyde, there's a lot of support [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6886.3s)]
*  for what Donald Trump is talking about in terms of deportations of migrants, of deregulation, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6890.46s)]
*  of ending the woke agenda. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6895.42s)]
*  What he's got during that speech, from now on, there will just be two genders in America, [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6896.86s)]

*  Well, there he is. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6906.219999999999s)]
*  He's of course now the new commander in chief, President Donald Trump, the 47th president [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6908.74s)]
*  and 45th president, of course, the first man in history since the early 19th century to [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6915.9s)]
*  win a second term in office out of consecutive terms. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6924.66s)]
*  He in his inaugural made it clear that he is going to hit the ground running with a [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6934.099999999999s)]
*  whole raft of executive orders. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6939.62s)]
*  He's going to declare a national emergency on the southern border. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6941.86s)]
*  He's going to have a mass deportation program. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6945.78s)]
*  Obviously, those measures are going to be subject to legal challenge. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6948.66s)]
*  But he's made it clear that he is a man of action and it's exactly what those 77 million [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6952.58s)]
*  Americans who voted for him wanted. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=6959.46s)]

*  Welcome to our special BBC coverage of Donald Trump's second inauguration. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7181.3s)]
*  I'm Sumi Somos-Gandha. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7185.9400000000005s)]
*  You're watching live pictures from the Capitol Rotunda. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7187.14s)]
*  Donald Trump now president again. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7190.18s)]
*  Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump just departing through those curtains there. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7192.5s)]
*  We have just seen him sworn in as America's 47th president. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7197.22s)]
*  He's starting a second term in the White House in which he is promising to reshape America. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7202.02s)]
*  You see Donald Trump and Melania Trump now exiting their through the law library doors [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7206.82s)]
*  and they are now going to be heading to, we understand, an overflow room where many of [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7212.58s)]
*  the invited guests who could not fit in that Capitol Rotunda have been watching the inauguration [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7218.259999999999s)]
*  ceremony. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7223.62s)]
*  You see the outgoing President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden walking just behind there [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7224.259999999999s)]
*  and just behind them. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7231.62s)]
*  Now Vice President JD Vance and the second lady, Usha Vance, walking just behind them. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7233.62s)]
*  The ceremony just wrapping up and here we are. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7241.0599999999995s)]
*  We have a second gentleman departing as well. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7243.379999999999s)]
*  Outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7246.66s)]
*  As we mentioned, Donald Trump is expected to greet some of the inauguration watchers [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7252.58s)]
*  in the overflow room. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7257.54s)]
*  That includes, of course, some dignitaries and sitting lawmakers who could not be present [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7258.98s)]
*  in the Capitol Rotunda room because of limited space. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7263.62s)]
*  But we just saw that wrap up. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7266.9s)]
*  President Trump promised a flurry of executive actions on day one on immigration, energy [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7269.219999999999s)]
*  production, crime and other issues. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7275.0599999999995s)]
*  Here you see images of Donald Trump's children. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7276.9s)]
*  Donald Jr., Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7280.0199999999995s)]
*  There's Barron Trump as well. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7282.58s)]
*  And you see Pam Bondi, who is Donald Trump's pick to be attorney general. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7284.74s)]
*  We saw her confirmation hearings beginning in Washington just this past week. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7288.82s)]
*  Katrina, you're on the line as well. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7292.26s)]
*  Just tell us what you made of Donald Trump. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7296.099999999999s)]
*  Indeed, we've been watching this obviously here on Capitol Hill. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7301.94s)]
*  And I think he struck quite a different tone to what we heard in 2017 in that so-called [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7305.219999999999s)]
*  American Carnage speech. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7311.219999999999s)]
*  Here he's talking about the golden age of America, full of plans that he has for this [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7312.58s)]
*  country, even saying he intends to put American astronauts on Mars during his tenure, which [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7317.62s)]
*  caused a huge smile to break across the face of Elon Musk, of course, the owner of SpaceX, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7324.18s)]
*  and a very now close friend and confidant of Donald Trump and close advisor. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7329.7s)]
*  We saw him sitting in amongst the family indeed, didn't we? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7334.5s)]
*  It was really interesting, that seating plan where you had members of cabinet mixed in [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7337.86s)]
*  with the family and with those close friends that Donald Trump has made of people like [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7343.22s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg, of course, the owner of Metta, and many other of the tech CEOs there. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7349.06s)]
*  Again, everything noteworthy and unusual really about this inauguration, just as we see everyone [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7356.26s)]
*  leaving there through the halls of the Capitol moving to the next stage of these sort of formal [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7361.22s)]
*  proceedings. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7368.5s)]
*  Donald Trump will have an opportunity now to officially sign the nomination papers for [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7369.46s)]
*  those cabinet picks that we've been discussing. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7373.7s)]
*  Now that he officially is president, he can make those nominations in an official way. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7376.82s)]
*  Some speculation whether while he's doing that, he may also sign some of those executive [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7382.26s)]
*  orders and memorandums and actions that he was talking about during that speech. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7387.86s)]
*  I think quite a few eyebrows will have been raised about his intention to rename the Gulf [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7392.9s)]
*  of Mexico the Gulf of America. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7397.14s)]
*  Also, some cultural issues we've been discussing about this affirmation he was talking about that [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7400.740000000001s)]
*  there were now only two genders in official US government business, male and female. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7406.740000000001s)]
*  But again, full of bright remarks, in contrast to what we heard from him in 2017 saying America's [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7413.14s)]
*  decline is over, he said today. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7420.02s)]
*  He also struck some warnings which were actually quite similar to the warnings we heard [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7423.14s)]
*  from Joe Biden in his farewell address just a couple of days ago when he was talking about the [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7427.22s)]
*  nexus of power and wealth and how that was concentrated in America and how potentially [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7432.660000000001s)]
*  damaging it was. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7437.06s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump made exactly the same point during his speech here. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7438.18s)]
*  So that was quite an interesting note as well. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7442.1s)]
*  But you know, he's talking about a tide of change, sunlight pouring all over the entire world, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7444.740000000001s)]
*  very, I think, an attempt to be quite statesmanlike and quite presidential in parts of the [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7451.38s)]
*  speech. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7457.3s)]
*  And then it turned into something of a campaign speech, really, didn't it, where he was making [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7457.94s)]
*  these pledges. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7462.74s)]
*  We don't often hear those kind of specific things in an inaugural address. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7463.46s)]
*  We generally hear sort of bigger viewpoints, ideological points and the vision for America. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7468.18s)]
*  Whereas there were quite a lot of specifics here, assuming we weren't there in terms of [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7476.18s)]
*  individual policies that Donald Trump, now that he's president, intends to address. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7479.46s)]
*  Indeed, Katrina, we certainly did. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7486.82s)]
*  And we're going to be talking about this as we see the Supreme Court justices just filing out. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7489.3s)]
*  We saw the leadership of the House and Senate filing out there as well. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7493.54s)]
*  We saw former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as she was [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7498.26s)]
*  talking to Donald Trump's children just briefly there as she was leaving the rotunda, as everyone's [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7503.38s)]
*  exiting now as these formal, that part of the formal proceedings, as you said, Katrina, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7508.42s)]
*  are moving on. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7512.9800000000005s)]
*  And we'll see Donald Trump move on to the next phase of this inauguration day, as you said. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7513.78s)]
*  We saw there's Jared Kushner and, again, his children walking now through that hall and [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7519.06s)]
*  exiting the Capitol rotunda. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7524.9s)]
*  Really interesting, as you said, Katrina, that makeup of the first few rows of people who were [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7526.58s)]
*  seated together. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7531.78s)]
*  I noticed during the benediction when the reverend, the pastor, was speaking, you saw [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7532.5s)]
*  the reaction from Donald Trump. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7537.7s)]
*  And just two rows behind, the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, with a big grin on his face. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7539.139999999999s)]
*  And we also saw Elon Musk watching closely. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7544.339999999999s)]
*  Such a fascinating mix of power in politics, tech in politics, really in one room. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7546.98s)]
*  And to your point on those policies, they had been telegraphed all morning from the Trump team [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7553.299999999999s)]
*  that we were going to see some of these executive orders as we see some lawmakers here. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7559.94s)]
*  Senator Chuck Schumer now departing. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7564.740000000001s)]
*  You can see that hat, of course, Katrina. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7566.9800000000005s)]
*  It is still very cold. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7569.06s)]
*  You will know because you're on a rooftop at the moment. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7570.34s)]
*  But the sun is shining as they depart and the inauguration ceremonies continue. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7573.14s)]
*  I can testify that it is still very cold here in Washington, D.C., but the sun is shining on [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7578.1s)]
*  our backs. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7584.9800000000005s)]
*  And what more could you wish for than a bit of a sun on your back or even on your face? [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7585.38s)]
*  And that kind of chimes in with the theme of Donald Trump's speech in many ways, that he [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7589.860000000001s)]
*  views it as a new dawn, a new sunshine for America's referencing sunlight. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7595.9400000000005s)]
*  Even at one point, we're seeing there the Supreme Court justices leaving here and everyone [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7600.900000000001s)]
*  spilling out into the sunshine there. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7605.3s)]
*  And we can see all the former presidents coming down the steps there out of the shade and into [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7608.1s)]
*  the sunshine there. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7614.5s)]
*  And we can see, of course, in the middle of that screen on the left, President Donald Trump, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7615.7s)]
*  the 47th president of America, and his wife, Melania Trump, followed by Joe Biden and Jill [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7620.0199999999995s)]
*  Biden, of course, now former President Joe Biden and former First Lady Jill Biden. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7625.7s)]
*  And behind them, Vice President J.D. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7630.099999999999s)]
*  Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7632.099999999999s)]
*  They're making their way now to this, is the next sort of formal part of proceedings, which [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7635.46s)]
*  is the bidding of farewell to Joe Biden. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7640.42s)]
*  His term in office officially ended at midday Eastern time here in the US, 5 p.m. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7644.1s)]
*  in the UK. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7650.900000000001s)]
*  And so we can see the helicopter there, which Joe Biden and Jill Biden and presumably Kamala [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7651.860000000001s)]
*  Harris, although do we see her there? [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7659.3s)]
*  It's hard to tell from this angle we'll get into. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7660.5s)]
*  Well, we're joined on the line now by Brian Lanz, a former senior adviser to the Trump [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7662.740000000001s)]
*  Vance 2024 campaign and also a member of President Trump's 2020-21 presidential transition team, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7667.780000000001s)]
*  a close adviser of President Trump. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7674.740000000001s)]
*  We can say it now. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7678.1s)]
*  It's official, Brian. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7678.900000000001s)]
*  We were chatting earlier about what might be in that speech and what tone he might set [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7680.900000000001s)]
*  for his presidency. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7686.02s)]
*  What did you make of what you heard? [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7687.38s)]
*  Listen, I thought it was a very unifying speech. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7689.62s)]
*  I mean, you have to remember the country has asked him to come back to Washington, D.C. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7691.860000000001s)]
*  and implement these radical changes. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7696.1s)]
*  And it is a unifying message. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7697.780000000001s)]
*  I think you see the president speaking with a tremendous amount of confidence because [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7699.620000000001s)]
*  he knows he has a team who has the ability to execute on their priorities. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7703.860000000001s)]
*  It was good to see the president. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7706.9800000000005s)]
*  It was good to see his family. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7708.58s)]
*  It's good to see him get right to work. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7710.42s)]
*  There's a lot to do. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7711.780000000001s)]
*  And this is a man who's dedicated to working very hard for the American people. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7712.9800000000005s)]
*  And so it's good that we have these moments of shifting powers here in Washington, D.C. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7717.3s)]
*  But it's also we can't lose sight. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7724.1s)]
*  We're here for the American people. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7726.1s)]
*  The circumstances and prompts is great, but there's desks that need to be filled with [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7728.26s)]
*  people who need to be working on behalf of all Americans, taxpayers, to make sure that [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7733.06s)]
*  their priorities are being met. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7737.14s)]
*  And that's the one thing President Trump understands better than anybody else, is that [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7738.26s)]
*  Washington's not here to work for the politicians. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7742.660000000001s)]
*  Washington's here to work for America. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7745.14s)]
*  And that's what he's bringing. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7746.9800000000005s)]
*  Indeed, he said that in one of his first sentences in the speech, didn't he? [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7749.9400000000005s)]
*  He said, I will very simply put America first. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7752.9s)]
*  And then he went on to say, our sovereignty will be reclaimed, our safety will be restored, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7756.82s)]
*  the scales of justice will be rebalanced, and then a number of other specific policy points. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7761.0599999999995s)]
*  Was there a particular highlight from you, something that you heard from him that [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7766.0199999999995s)]
*  will stick in your mind from this speech? [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7770.66s)]
*  Listen, I think, truthfully, him talking about putting the American people first, [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7773.54s)]
*  America first, I mean, I think far too long, [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7776.74s)]
*  whether it's before President Trump was in office the first time or even during these [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7779.219999999999s)]
*  last eight years, the American people have felt left behind. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7782.34s)]
*  You know, they felt the corporations, they felt the globalism was sort of hurting them [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7785.14s)]
*  and that Washington, D.C. was not there to service them. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7789.9400000000005s)]
*  And so when President Trump said that clearly and definitively, [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7793.54s)]
*  among the first things, that it's America first, I think that's what I wanted to hear. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7796.82s)]
*  You know, America first doesn't mean America only. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7801.54s)]
*  America first means that we're prioritizing the tax, the resources of the American people [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7804.58s)]
*  to prioritize them here domestically and abroad. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7809.22s)]
*  And that has a huge impact on foreign policy. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7812.26s)]
*  You saw some of the foreign policy successes in the last couple of days [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7814.74s)]
*  when the terrorists got released. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7820.26s)]
*  Most would say it was President Trump's tweets demanding Hamas release the Americans [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7822.02s)]
*  that sort of prompted this, you know, the hostage negotiation to get restarted. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7827.22s)]
*  So there's nothing wrong with America first, right? [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7832.26s)]
*  We're a big world and we will work with others, but I think President Trump, [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7834.5s)]
*  you know, making sure, you know, that we don't have the huge homeless problems [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7838.5s)]
*  that we've had in the last 30 years. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7842.0199999999995s)]
*  During the Biden administration, homelessness has risen 30 percent. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7843.139999999999s)]
*  That doesn't sound like America first to me as we sent $200 billion to Ukraine. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7846.82s)]
*  So I think the people wanted this change. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7851.219999999999s)]
*  They're going to get it. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7852.98s)]
*  We're excited about it. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7853.94s)]
*  And I'm excited to see, you know, my friend, my old boss, President Trump, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7855.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, getting ready to implement change, [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7858.82s)]
*  which this city needs and this country desperately wants. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7861.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7866.58s)]
*  As you've been speaking, we're seeing these images here as the Bidens are indeed departing [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7866.82s)]
*  about to get on that helicopter, not riding off into the sunset, if you will. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7871.7s)]
*  It is, of course, still daytime here in Washington. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7875.94s)]
*  But these images we see here, them departing, saying goodbye to Donald Trump and Melania Trump. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7878.34s)]
*  And just a moment ago, we saw the former vice president now, Kamala Harris, departing, [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7884.26s)]
*  giving both Joe and Joe Biden a quite long embrace before they left in a car in a motorcade to depart. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7889.3s)]
*  And there, that is the end of that farewell ceremony for [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7895.94s)]
*  Joe Biden and Joe Biden. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7899.860000000001s)]
*  And we know that earlier in the day, of course, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7901.7s)]
*  they did have tea together in the White House as the beginning of this procession, [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7904.18s)]
*  this handover began. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7907.54s)]
*  Joe Biden was asked if he had written Donald Trump a letter, as is the tradition from an [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7909.22s)]
*  outgoing president into an incoming president. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7914.18s)]
*  And he said he had. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7917.22s)]
*  He was asked what was in that letter. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7918.18s)]
*  And he said, that's between me and Donald Trump. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7919.7s)]
*  So here now you have the president and vice president, [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7922.26s)]
*  the first lady and second lady there all standing together as they watch the Bidens depart. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7926.26s)]
*  And, Brian, this really was today the handover as we are used to seeing it, [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7932.66s)]
*  this democratic milestone that was being celebrated as well. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7938.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, listen, it's great. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7941.3s)]
*  It's an important part of our culture, these peaceful transitions of powers. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7943.22s)]
*  It's great that President Trump's there, that Biden is leaving. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7948.66s)]
*  Everything's happening, taking place. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7951.860000000001s)]
*  But I would point out that it is sort of sad to see Joe Biden leave as he pardons his entire family [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7952.98s)]
*  for all their criminal activity on this final day. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7958.74s)]
*  It's pretty remarkable that, A, they accept the pardon because that's accepting guilt on [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7961.62s)]
*  their behavior. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7965.86s)]
*  So that just tells you what we need to know the last four years of Joe Biden's tenure, [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7966.42s)]
*  that it very much was a crime family that got a pardon at the last minute. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7970.259999999999s)]
*  That's not American. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7974.099999999999s)]
*  The average American doesn't have access to those things of being wiped free of all their sins. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7975.219999999999s)]
*  In my view, it's good that he's leaving because we're ending the dark part of American history [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7980.58s)]
*  where he weaponized the judicial system and he prioritized his friends and families over [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7984.82s)]
*  everybody else. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7989.86s)]
*  That's not who America is. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7990.82s)]
*  Brian, we should just say, of course, that investigations into Joe Biden himself did not [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7994.0199999999995s)]
*  turn up any evidence of rondoing, nor among the family members who he preemptively pardoned in [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=7997.54s)]
*  his final minutes in office today. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8003.139999999999s)]
*  But indeed, this handover has been... [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8005.62s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8008.82s)]
*  Listen, when you accept the pardon, the U.S. Supreme Court has said when you accept the [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8009.78s)]
*  pardon, you're accepting guilt. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8013.3s)]
*  So it's very hard to say that investigations have been done clearly when the family right [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8014.98s)]
*  now is there leaving it, they're accepting guilt. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8019.22s)]
*  What are they accepting guilt of? [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8020.98s)]
*  That would be my question. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8023.62s)]
*  Okay, I think we're just seeing if Katrina is still linked up here. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8034.58s)]
*  But as we're looking at these pictures, of course, of the Biden's departing, we've just [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8037.3s)]
*  seen that departure ceremony, that farewell, the outgoing president and first lady, and [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8041.38s)]
*  the now current president, Donald Trump, and his first lady, and vice president and second [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8047.22s)]
*  lady. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8052.42s)]
*  This is all culminating after the inauguration ceremony that we saw inside the rotunda at [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8053.14s)]
*  the Capitol. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8058.58s)]
*  Again, all of that was planned very last minute. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8059.38s)]
*  These ceremonies were moved indoors. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8062.74s)]
*  They were supposed to be held as they usually are in the steps of the Capitol where the [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8064.82s)]
*  swearing-in is held and with tens of thousands of people watching on the National Mall. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8068.42s)]
*  And here, this was a different ceremony, but one that had a lot of that pomp and pageantry [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8073.78s)]
*  that we are accustomed to seeing during such a ceremony. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8078.58s)]
*  And, Brian, I want to ask you a bit about what we saw in the actual rotunda and that [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8082.66s)]
*  seating arrangement. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8088.42s)]
*  It really was remarkable to see members of Donald Trump's family sitting, I believe, [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8089.219999999999s)]
*  side by side with some of the titans of the tech industry. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8094.02s)]
*  What did you make of that? [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8097.46s)]
*  You know, listen, I think it's Donald Trump bringing the business community here. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8098.34s)]
*  It wasn't just tech industry. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8103.22s)]
*  There were other CEOs there that were there. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8104.26s)]
*  And I think, you know, America is eager for President Trump to engage the business community. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8106.1s)]
*  I think the last four years they haven't felt as engaged, the business community hasn't [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8110.660000000001s)]
*  as felt engaged with their government as they felt during Trump tenure. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8114.26s)]
*  So they're back. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8117.620000000001s)]
*  They're here to welcome him. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8118.18s)]
*  They're here to say that America is open for business. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8119.06s)]
*  And that's a good thing. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8121.46s)]
*  You saw our cabinet members there. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8123.22s)]
*  You had a lot of cabinet members who've had successful business careers. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8124.5s)]
*  Listen, America is open for business and it's being handled by people who understand business [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8127.54s)]
*  and who want this country to grow. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8131.62s)]
*  The bureaucrats, I'd say, you keep an eye out because they're going to be pushed out [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8133.7s)]
*  of this town because it's not about them. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8138.02s)]
*  It's about the American people. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8140.34s)]
*  It's about affordability. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8141.54s)]
*  And it's about their lives. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8142.58s)]
*  It's not about Washington expanding itself. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8143.780000000001s)]
*  Brian, just as we're listening to you there, you can see just over my shoulder [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8148.18s)]
*  and you can see on your screens there the helicopter taking off that is carrying now [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8153.06s)]
*  former President Joe Biden and former First Lady Jill Biden. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8157.9400000000005s)]
*  They're literally flying right over our heads there. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8162.42s)]
*  And we're speaking to you now. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8165.620000000001s)]
*  And that marks the end officially of Joe Biden's business, official business, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8167.780000000001s)]
*  as president of the United States. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8172.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the last formal involvement for him in that helicopter just taking off now. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8174.9800000000005s)]
*  And he goes on to the next chapter in his life after five decades in public service, [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8181.06s)]
*  36 years as a senator, eight years as vice president, and of course, [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8187.38s)]
*  the last four years as president, the 46th president of the United States. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8191.620000000001s)]
*  And you can see there the flags are flying at full staff on the Capitol. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8197.460000000001s)]
*  We were talking about that earlier how they had been at half mast following the death [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8201.54s)]
*  of Jimmy Carter, but they are back up at full staff upon the request of the Republican Party [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8206.1s)]
*  in honor of the celebration of today, the inauguration of Donald Trump. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8212.74s)]
*  It's coming to us from the overflow part of the U.S. Capitol because as we've been saying, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8216.9s)]
*  moving the ceremony inside to the rotunda meant there was a very tight limit on the [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8222.5s)]
*  number of people who could be seated in there. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8226.66s)]
*  So there are about 1,200 people in this room we're looking at here, [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8228.58s)]
*  which is the visitor center of the Capitol building. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8231.62s)]
*  It's just behind the Capitol building and underneath a little, just actually quite close [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8235.3s)]
*  to the area that that helicopter just took off from. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8239.939999999999s)]
*  So all of these people here, staffers, other family and friends, constituents that have been [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8243.46s)]
*  invited by the various congresspeople who would normally be in prime seating right in front of [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8249.06s)]
*  the inaugural platform, but on the lower section, looking up at those steps where all the principals [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8254.5s)]
*  would be seated, here they are in the visitor center. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8259.939999999999s)]
*  Now the plan is for President Donald Trump to make his way to this area here to speak to this [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8262.82s)]
*  gathered audience. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8271.38s)]
*  We're told he will make remarks of about 10 minutes or so, but we're also told they will [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8272.98s)]
*  be non-scripted. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8277.22s)]
*  And as we know with Donald Trump, if it's non-scripted and he gets in his flow, he's [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8278.42s)]
*  president now, he will no doubt be setting out some more of those policies that we saw him [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8282.66s)]
*  articulating in the inaugural dress just a few moments ago. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8288.26s)]
*  So there's great excitement in that room, as you can see as well. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8292.42s)]
*  A big moment for all of these supporters and a big moment in history for the American people. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8296.18s)]
*  As we heard Donald Trump say, the golden age of America begins right now. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8301.86s)]
*  He said, from this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8306.58s)]
*  He said all over the world, I will very simply put America first. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8311.22s)]
*  We're looking at pictures there on the stage and we can see some of the members there [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8317.38s)]
*  arriving. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8323.78s)]
*  Senator Deb Fischer, of course, who is the lady in the green dress, as you look at her, [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8324.58s)]
*  who is making remarks, the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson there as well, all on the stage, [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8328.42s)]
*  awaiting the arrival of Donald Trump, President of the United States, to greet these supporters [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8333.46s)]
*  here who have been viewing the ceremony on a big screen there as it happened, not too far from [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8341.38s)]
*  where they are seated in the rotunda, the podium there with the presidential seal of office, [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8348.98s)]
*  awaiting those remarks from President Trump. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8355.22s)]
*  What he's doing in the meantime, he's going, as we saw, he's waved off Joe Biden there and [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8359.939999999999s)]
*  he will be now, he's now headed back in to the Capitol building. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8364.5s)]
*  He was not due to hold the signing ceremony until after he spoke to the people gathered here. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8369.539999999999s)]
*  However, proceedings are running at this point about 20 or 30 minutes, slightly behind schedule. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8376.179999999998s)]
*  So he may be doing that signing before he comes here. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8382.82s)]
*  We'll find out about that in just a moment. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8386.98s)]
*  I want to bring in Margaret Taleb. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8389.619999999999s)]
*  She's senior contributor for Axios and she is also at Syracuse University. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8391.06s)]
*  Margaret, you've watched plenty of these inaugural addresses as we all have. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8397.859999999999s)]
*  What did you make of that? [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8401.22s)]
*  Actually, I'm just seeing that Speaker Mike Johnson is taking to the podium there. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8402.179999999998s)]
*  So we might have a listen in to what he's saying. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8406.58s)]
*  Right now, already this morning, you can feel it around the country. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8410.26s)]
*  We certainly felt it here in the city. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8413.22s)]
*  America is coming together and roaring back again and it begins today, as the President just told us. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8416.099999999999s)]
*  I know we'd all rather be gathered together on the National Mall with hundreds of thousands of [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8422.58s)]
*  our closest friends, but our disappointment is well overcome with our excitement for the [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8426.98s)]
*  future that we feel today. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8432.9s)]
*  We have the chance to make the next four years the most consequential period in our nation's history. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8434.74s)]
*  And as Speaker of the House, it is my great pleasure, my great honor, to introduce to you [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8441.3s)]
*  the man who will lead us to this new golden age, the decisive winner of the Electoral College [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8447.06s)]
*  and the popular vote, the 45th and the 47th and the greatest president of our lifetimes, [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8455.3s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8462.82s)]
*  USA! USA! USA! [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8515.3s)]
*  USA! USA! [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8545.3s)]
*  Well, thank you all so much for being here. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8561.3s)]
*  And was that a hell of a speech or what? [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8563.22s)]
*  That was man. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8564.82s)]
*  That was a good way to start it off. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8569.14s)]
*  You know, I didn't know exactly what the president would put in that speech. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8570.5s)]
*  And I hoped to myself that he wasn't going to hold back. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8573.46s)]
*  And sir, you didn't hold back. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8576.66s)]
*  That was a hell of a way to start the next four years. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8577.859999999999s)]
*  But I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, and I know I speak for the president [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8580.5s)]
*  and for all of us, thank you, thank you, thank you for making this possible. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8584.5s)]
*  We love you. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8588.82s)]
*  We wouldn't be here without you. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8589.859999999999s)]
*  And we're going to make America great again together for the next four years. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8591.14s)]
*  And the last thing I'll say is, you know, having stood outside for about five minutes [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8594.26s)]
*  to wave goodbye to the Bidens, thank God we moved that thing indoors, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8608.18s)]
*  because it was a beautiful ceremony and it was cold as hell outside. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8612.26s)]
*  So sir, the 45th and 47th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8615.54s)]
*  No, he's right. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8624.26s)]
*  I looked, I said, oh, look at this beautiful sunny day. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8630.18s)]
*  We blew it. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8634.26s)]
*  We blew it. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8635.06s)]
*  And then I went outside and we were freezing. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8635.86s)]
*  You would have been very unhappy. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8638.74s)]
*  The sun was very deceptive, I will tell you. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8640.66s)]
*  It is cold out. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8643.06s)]
*  And I'm sort of saying, you know, that was so beautiful today. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8644.74s)]
*  Maybe they should do it there every four years. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8647.06s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8649.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8650.74s)]
*  Because, you know, the outdoor thing is really good, but it gets a little cold around this time [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8651.78s)]
*  of the year, as some people have noticed. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8655.86s)]
*  And a lot of times they suffer through it. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8658.1s)]
*  There was no suffering in that room. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8660.66s)]
*  It was 72 degrees. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8662.18s)]
*  It was perfect with the best acoustics I think I've ever heard in a room. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8663.460000000001s)]
*  This is not so bad either. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8668.26s)]
*  But I just want to say you're a younger, far more beautiful audience that I just spoke to. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8670.58s)]
*  And I want to keep it off the record. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8678.58s)]
*  I want to keep that off the record because I don't want to have all those big shots up there. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8681.46s)]
*  I don't want to think you're more powerful than them. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8688.02s)]
*  You look better than them. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8690.34s)]
*  And I love you. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8691.78s)]
*  Now, we just had a great time. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8696.42s)]
*  We just had a great day. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8698.02s)]
*  This was amazing. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8700.58s)]
*  You know, when you think we took a journey, I mentioned in the speech, a lot of people said [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8701.94s)]
*  that was not a journey that was possible. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8706.74s)]
*  And it was indeed possible. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8709.14s)]
*  I didn't really know too much about what they were saying when they said that. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8711.14s)]
*  But a lot of people felt it. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8713.939999999999s)]
*  And we hooked up with JD very early. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8716.5s)]
*  I watched JD over a period of time. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8719.3s)]
*  I endorsed him in Ohio. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8721.22s)]
*  He was a great senator and very, very smart. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8723.46s)]
*  The only one smarter than him was his wife. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8728.26s)]
*  So that was — I wouldn't have chosen her, but somehow the line of — the line of succession [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8730.34s)]
*  didn't work that way, right? [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8735.699999999999s)]
*  But now she's great. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8737.699999999999s)]
*  And he's great. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8738.82s)]
*  This is a great, beautiful couple and unbelievable career. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8739.46s)]
*  I just said to him, you are very upwardly mobile, because he hasn't been doing it that long. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8744.58s)]
*  But he picked it up so quickly. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8749.699999999999s)]
*  Remember, the first week was a little bit like the fake news was hitting him really hard. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8751.3s)]
*  And I said, ooh, this may be tough. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8756.9s)]
*  But after that, it was smooth sailing for him. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8758.9s)]
*  He took on everybody. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8762.1s)]
*  He took on the meanest. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8763.3s)]
*  I don't want to use the word corrupt because we're into a new system. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8765.619999999999s)]
*  So let's wait till the corruption begins because it will. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8769.859999999999s)]
*  But he took on some pretty mean people and he handled it well. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8773.38s)]
*  I want to also congratulate Mike Johnson for the job that he's doing. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8776.82s)]
*  See, we gave him a majority of almost nothing. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8785.699999999999s)]
*  And then I said to make it tougher on him, let me take two or three of the people, right? [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8790.099999999999s)]
*  I said he'll only have to suffer with that for about three months. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8794.74s)]
*  How are they doing, by the way? [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8797.54s)]
*  Are they is that moving along? [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8798.58s)]
*  I said, do you mind if I take this one, that one and a couple of others? [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8802.66s)]
*  He didn't mind he can handle it. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8806.26s)]
*  No, he's a man that's liked by everybody. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8808.1s)]
*  I've never met a man like this. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8809.94s)]
*  You've got two. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8811.220000000001s)]
*  How many is it? [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8811.86s)]
*  219 or 220 or so? [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8812.42s)]
*  220. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8814.58s)]
*  And of the 220, 219 really like him. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8815.7s)]
*  I noticed he got one negative vote once about two weeks ago. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8818.18s)]
*  But I think even 220 like him, if you want to know the truth. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8821.7s)]
*  And that's very unusual. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8824.5s)]
*  I know a lot of nice guys in Congress and they have 35 people that hate them. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8826.1s)]
*  So you have 35 people that hate you and you only have one or two or three votes. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8830.42s)]
*  You'll have five, I think. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8834.02s)]
*  But that's that's going to be like, you know, the good news is when we get to that five number, [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8835.54s)]
*  it's going to feel like a massive majority. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8839.94s)]
*  You could be really nasty to a couple of them, at least. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8843.62s)]
*  So it's going to feel like hitting your head on the wall and stopping. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8847.54s)]
*  It feels so good to stop. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8851.22s)]
*  But he's done a fantastic job. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8852.42s)]
*  And Steve Scalise is he's our hero because, you know, I was with him. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8854.42s)]
*  You talk about being shot. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8863.38s)]
*  I was with him. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8865.779999999999s)]
*  He got some bad ones and his credible wife and she really loves him. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8866.74s)]
*  You know, you never know about that. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8872.98s)]
*  I've been with other people that were doing poorly and the wife is like looking at a watch. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8874.5s)]
*  She can't get out of the hospital fast enough. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8878.9s)]
*  How's he doing? [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8882.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8883.06s)]
*  He's all right. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8883.619999999999s)]
*  That woman was a mess. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8885.3s)]
*  She was crying and crying. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8887.539999999999s)]
*  No, they're going to take him. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8889.859999999999s)]
*  They're going to take him. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8891.06s)]
*  I told Steve when he finally woke up, it was a while to the doctor told me it was the most [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8892.42s)]
*  blood they've ever transfused in any patient. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8897.699999999999s)]
*  They've never done anything like it. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8900.74s)]
*  And here he is, the picture of strength. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8902.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8904.5s)]
*  And he's been a great friend of mine. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8904.82s)]
*  All right. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8907.46s)]
*  With a family because of the family. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8908.66s)]
*  And what a job you did. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8911.78s)]
*  It worked out pretty much pretty much better than we even thought. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8913.14s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8917.38s)]
*  And I did have a couple of things, you know, to say that were extremely controversial. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8918.5s)]
*  And between JD and Melania and anybody else that heard, please, sir, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8923.14s)]
*  it's such a beautiful, unifying speech. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8929.38s)]
*  Please, sir, don't say these things. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8931.699999999999s)]
*  I said, I'm telling you, it's going to play great. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8933.94s)]
*  They say, you're right for this group of people. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8938.42s)]
*  It's going to play great. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8940.34s)]
*  You're the only ones I heard by that. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8942.02s)]
*  Oh, but we had some beauties, didn't we, Melania? [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8943.86s)]
*  She said, sir, calls me sir when she's angry. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8946.1s)]
*  No, no, I'm only kidding. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8951.62s)]
*  I better say I'm only kidding or the press is going to pick that one up loud and clear. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8953.54s)]
*  No, but she said, no, I think it's it was a good thing. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8958.980000000001s)]
*  It would be terrible. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8963.46s)]
*  It's such a nice speech. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8964.5s)]
*  I think it's you know, it all depends on your delivery. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8965.699999999999s)]
*  How was the delivery? [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8968.42s)]
*  Was it good? [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8969.38s)]
*  But she said it's such a beautiful, such a beautiful speech. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8974.179999999998s)]
*  You can't put things in there that you are going to put in. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8977.46s)]
*  And I was going to talk about the J6 hostages, but you'll be happy [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8981.22s)]
*  because you know, it's action, not words that count. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8988.42s)]
*  And you're going to see a lot of action on the J6 hostages. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8992.179999999998s)]
*  And I was going to talk about the things that Joe did today with the [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=8999.779999999999s)]
*  pardons of people that were very, very guilty of very bad crimes, like [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9003.699999999999s)]
*  the unselect committee of political folks, where they literally, I mean, [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9010.339999999998s)]
*  what they did is they destroyed and deleted all of the information, [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9017.54s)]
*  all of the hearings, practically not a thing left. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9022.580000000002s)]
*  They deleted all the information on Nancy Pelosi having turned down [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9026.980000000001s)]
*  the offer of 10,000 soldiers. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9031.140000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't have needed 10,000. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9032.820000000002s)]
*  You could have had 500 and it would have stopped because we made out [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9034.18s)]
*  a million people that day, the people that were there. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9039.300000000001s)]
*  You don't see any photographs, but we have a lot of great photos, [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9041.94s)]
*  but you don't see those photographs. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9045.300000000001s)]
*  They don't put them in. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9046.74s)]
*  They show the people at the Capitol. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9047.46s)]
*  But I was talking about that. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9049.78s)]
*  I was going to talk about that. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9052.98s)]
*  They said, please don't bring that up right now. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9055.22s)]
*  You can bring it up tomorrow. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9057.619999999999s)]
*  I said, how about now in front of the very, I'll bring it up right now. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9059.06s)]
*  You know, this little time delay is good because we're getting [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9065.22s)]
*  great reviews on the speech. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9067.699999999999s)]
*  Now watch, they'll take the speech and say, I didn't like it because [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9069.14s)]
*  he left there and he's talked to people, but we're giving you a little [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9072.42s)]
*  more information though. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9075.7s)]
*  He gave up says, but no, they pardoned a lot of people. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9076.740000000002s)]
*  They pardoned before we even get to today. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9080.34s)]
*  They pardoned, what is it? [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9082.58s)]
*  33 murderers, absolute murderers, the worst murderers. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9084.1s)]
*  You know, when you get the death sentence in the United States, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9089.380000000001s)]
*  you have to be bad because they don't give it much. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9092.42s)]
*  And he pardoned almost everybody having a death sentence. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9096.26s)]
*  And if you went through the crimes that were committed, [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9099.86s)]
*  you wouldn't even believe them. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9103.3s)]
*  The level of violence, the people that were killed, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9104.34s)]
*  the innocence of people that were killed and children killed by these people. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9109.06s)]
*  And he pardoned them for whatever reason. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9112.34s)]
*  He spared them and, but they didn't spare the people that they killed. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9114.58s)]
*  And you know, who knows what happens in the future. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9118.74s)]
*  It's one of the worst because a lot of times they let them out early after that. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9121.38s)]
*  You know, they say you're going to be in for life, but then all of a sudden [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9124.5s)]
*  they get let out for good behavior and then they go on a rampage. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9127.539999999999s)]
*  It's one of those little things, right? [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9132.02s)]
*  But I was going to talk about that. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9134.42s)]
*  But I was really going to talk about the level of, you know, what's going on? [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9136.740000000002s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9141.94s)]
*  Why are we trying to help a guy like Millie? [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9142.900000000001s)]
*  Why are we doing Millie? [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9147.62s)]
*  He was pardoned. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9148.660000000002s)]
*  What he said, terrible what he said. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9149.7s)]
*  Why are we helping some of the people? [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9152.820000000002s)]
*  Why are we helping Liz Cheney? [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9155.220000000001s)]
*  I mean, Liz Cheney is a disaster. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9156.820000000002s)]
*  She's a crying lunatic and crying, crying Adam Kinzinger. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9158.66s)]
*  He's a super crying. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9163.3s)]
*  I never saw the guy not crying. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9164.5s)]
*  He's always crying. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9165.7s)]
*  I looked at him. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9167.46s)]
*  I remember years ago he was actually on my side. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9168.18s)]
*  And then one day, you know, when you don't want to kill people in wars, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9171.86s)]
*  they turn against you. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9174.5s)]
*  Liz Cheney hated the concept of not going to war with everybody. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9175.38s)]
*  Let's kill everybody. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9180.5s)]
*  Let's spend a lot of money on military equipment. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9181.619999999999s)]
*  You know where her father works, right? [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9184.34s)]
*  But what she did was incredible. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9188.66s)]
*  Think of it. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9201.86s)]
*  They destroyed and deleted all of that information that went on for almost two years against Trump. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9202.66s)]
*  And the reason they did because it was all false. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9208.26s)]
*  Like the person that said, I tried to strangle a Secret Service agent. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9211.38s)]
*  That's one of the toughest human beings I think I've ever seen. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9216.58s)]
*  I actually had a friend say, please don't change that history. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9220.18s)]
*  Remember, she said I put my hands around his neck [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9225.78s)]
*  because he wouldn't go to the Capitol. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9229.46s)]
*  Made up fiction. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9231.3s)]
*  And I was rebuffed. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9233.46s)]
*  And the guy on the right is a massive weightlifter, probably stronger than me. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9235.06s)]
*  Do you think he's stronger than me? [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9239.38s)]
*  Honey, you know who I'm talking. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9240.58s)]
*  Possibly stronger than me. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9242.74s)]
*  Slightly younger than me. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9244.9s)]
*  Like I won't say how many years because I don't want to talk about that, but a lot of years. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9246.34s)]
*  But I had a friend that said, why are you disputing that story? [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9252.98s)]
*  That's the coolest story I've ever heard. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9256.34s)]
*  That I would attack a karate champion, get slightly rebuffed, [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9258.66s)]
*  and then throw my arms around a guy with a neck about this big. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9263.220000000001s)]
*  Even though there are bars, you know, there are bars. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9268.18s)]
*  You can't really do that anyway. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9270.58s)]
*  So I wanted to talk about that. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9272.42s)]
*  But all of that stuff got deleted. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9276.1s)]
*  And the reason it got deleted is they were all caught in lies. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9278.34s)]
*  You know, Secret Service testified and they said it didn't happen. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9281.14s)]
*  Actually, the two guys were very embarrassed. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9285.54s)]
*  They're suffering because their friends are saying, did Trump really do that to you? [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9287.460000000001s)]
*  But they gained a whole new respect for me. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9294.18s)]
*  But it was just make-believe stuff. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9296.98s)]
*  And there were a lot of make-believe stories made up. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9298.9s)]
*  So rather than suffer the wrath, like the story with Nancy Pelosi, [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9301.939999999999s)]
*  I offered a 10,000 soldiers. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9305.699999999999s)]
*  She knows it. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9308.18s)]
*  She admitted it on tape that her daughter made. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9308.82s)]
*  She's a videographer or whatever you call her, which I'm glad she is. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9311.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, she can't be in good stead with Nancy. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9316.74s)]
*  But Nancy said it was my responsibility as she's leaving the Capitol. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9319.859999999999s)]
*  She said it was and it was. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9323.939999999999s)]
*  She's in charge of security at the Capitol. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9325.22s)]
*  But I offered them up to 10,000 soldiers, even more. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9327.62s)]
*  One time I said more as many as you need. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9331.78s)]
*  But you needed 4,500. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9333.7s)]
*  If 4,500, you 10,000, that would be more than the number of people there by lot. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9335.78s)]
*  But we offered her 10,000. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9341.460000000001s)]
*  Think of it, 10,000 soldiers. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9343.460000000001s)]
*  In other words, J6 wouldn't be J6. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9345.380000000001s)]
*  There would have been no J6. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9348.1s)]
*  But she rebuffed them. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9349.94s)]
*  She didn't like it. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9351.060000000001s)]
*  No, she didn't like it. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9352.02s)]
*  Maybe she wanted that to happen. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9353.460000000001s)]
*  But she's guilty as hell. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9355.7s)]
*  And now we would have to go through the process because they destroyed all evidence. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9357.86s)]
*  They deleted everything. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9362.820000000002s)]
*  There's virtually nothing left. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9364.42s)]
*  The other fake story and so many other fake stories. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9366.660000000002s)]
*  And many people came out on our side and those people now would get to find them. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9369.94s)]
*  There's nothing left. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9375.220000000001s)]
*  So that's a criminal offense. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9376.900000000001s)]
*  If that were a civil case, it would be a criminal offense. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9378.42s)]
*  If that happened civilly where you did that, it would be a criminal offense. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9382.26s)]
*  So I decided I'm not going to make this speech complicated. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9386.339999999998s)]
*  I'm going to make it beautiful. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9390.099999999999s)]
*  I'm going to make it a unifying speech. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9391.38s)]
*  And then when they said we have a group of people that are serious Trump fans, [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9394.259999999998s)]
*  I said this is the time to tell those stories. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9400.42s)]
*  But seriously, I like to I think it's a tremendous success. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9402.66s)]
*  I think we're very lucky we put it inside because it is really cold. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9417.38s)]
*  We just went to the helicopter out of respect. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9421.38s)]
*  Something that's taken place for a long time. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9426.1s)]
*  I guess it's as old as helicopters. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9428.98s)]
*  You used to get into a stagecoach. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9431.939999999999s)]
*  Now you get into a helicopter. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9433.539999999999s)]
*  Times change, but it's pretty pretty old custom. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9434.98s)]
*  And it's a beautiful custom. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9440.179999999998s)]
*  Actually, it's a beautiful custom. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9441.539999999999s)]
*  I wish we could have had a better relationship. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9442.9s)]
*  I wish we could have had a better relationship between Republicans and Democrats. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9445.619999999999s)]
*  I was with Senator Schumer. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9449.699999999999s)]
*  I said, Chuck, I think it's time we all start getting along a little bit [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9451.619999999999s)]
*  because it doesn't make sense. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9454.82s)]
*  I mean, we literally never get a Democrat vote. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9456.9s)]
*  They never get a Republican vote almost. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9459.06s)]
*  And although there is a bill coming up very shortly that we have a lot of Democrat votes. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9462.259999999998s)]
*  Right. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9467.14s)]
*  That's going to be a very beautiful bill. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9467.699999999999s)]
*  We're going to have a deciding, I would say within a week or so. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9471.46s)]
*  I think. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9473.939999999999s)]
*  And it's going to be a very good bill. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9474.98s)]
*  You all know what I'm talking about. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9477.22s)]
*  So I just want to thank you all for being here. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9478.66s)]
*  You have been our fans from day one. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9481.46s)]
*  All these people all over. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9483.22s)]
*  You've been our fan. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9485.539999999999s)]
*  And this has been a, this has been a, there's never been anything like it. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9486.42s)]
*  There's never been anything like it. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9498.5s)]
*  This has been a movement like no movement ever in history for probably any country, [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9500.02s)]
*  let alone this country. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9504.34s)]
*  You know, if somebody is running for president and if they go out [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9506.18s)]
*  and they announce they're going to Arizona, they're going to Nevada, [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9510.42s)]
*  they're going to someplace. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9513.78s)]
*  If you have 200 or 300 people, that would be standard. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9515.859999999999s)]
*  Ronald Reagan would go out. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9519.38s)]
*  I mean, outside of the last couple of days where people get a little excited, [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9521.14s)]
*  but even then you have a couple of thousand people. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9524.02s)]
*  But if you're going to go someplace, anyplace, any one of the swing states, [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9527.06s)]
*  any one of the other states, I mean, how about the non swing states? [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9532.42s)]
*  We won. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9536.1s)]
*  We won Tennessee by massive numbers. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9536.74s)]
*  Wyoming won by numbers that are nobody's ever seen. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9538.98s)]
*  And, you know, places like California, we did great, [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9542.98s)]
*  but when they send out like 38 million ballots, [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9548.18s)]
*  nobody knows where the hell they're sending them. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9551.22s)]
*  And then they come pouring back the whole thing. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9553.22s)]
*  You know, they passed a law in California that if you work in an election bureau [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9556.02s)]
*  and if you so much as ask for a voter ID, if you say, [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9560.9s)]
*  sir, ma'am, could I please look at your voter ID? [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9565.46s)]
*  They have the right to put you in jail. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9568.58s)]
*  You're a criminal. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9569.939999999999s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9570.74s)]
*  There's only one reason that happens. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9572.02s)]
*  They want to cheat. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9574.1s)]
*  So they had it where voter ID wasn't accepted. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9575.54s)]
*  But now if you even ask for it, this is seriously a bill that was just signed. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9579.54s)]
*  It passed in their legislature and it was signed. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9583.54s)]
*  And I think when we get things cleaned up and we get back to a little bit of normalcy, [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9589.060000000001s)]
*  I'm going to ask the speaker to really get involved [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9593.78s)]
*  because I think we would have won the state of California [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9595.86s)]
*  because if you look at my numbers with Hispanic, we're 56 percent. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9599.3s)]
*  And we were winning. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9604.5s)]
*  We won the Texas border that had never been won. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9605.3s)]
*  As the governor said, he's doing a good job, the governor, by the way, of Texas. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9609.14s)]
*  But as the governor said, it hasn't. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9612.5s)]
*  Oh, did I get lucky? [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9616.179999999998s)]
*  Did I get lucky? [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9619.859999999999s)]
*  Supposing I said, you know, he's not here, [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9620.98s)]
*  but the governor of Texas has done a terrible job. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9624.099999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9627.3s)]
*  Look at you. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9628.18s)]
*  You mean we couldn't get you up in the front row? [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9630.34s)]
*  I tell you. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9632.98s)]
*  Supposing I said, JD, the governor of Texas is not doing his job. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9636.5s)]
*  You heard what I said. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9642.34s)]
*  See, I didn't know you were there. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9643.300000000001s)]
*  I said he's doing he's doing a great job. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9644.74s)]
*  He's doing a phenomenal job. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9647.380000000001s)]
*  But now you're going to have a partner that's going to work with you [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9648.74s)]
*  because you didn't have not only did they have a partner, [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9651.54s)]
*  he had people selling you all. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9655.460000000001s)]
*  Right? [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9658.1s)]
*  We have a fence structure that we worked on, the governor worked on with me. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9658.66s)]
*  And I didn't love it, to be honest with you. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9663.06s)]
*  I wanted a nice, precarious concrete, you know, 40, 50 feet high, like a beautiful, [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9664.66s)]
*  could have been a T-shaped, Y-shaped. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9670.9s)]
*  I love construction. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9673.300000000001s)]
*  I wanted that sucker to go up maybe 50, 60 feet. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9675.06s)]
*  It would have looked beautiful. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9677.86s)]
*  A nice Y shape. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9678.9s)]
*  And they said the problem is, sir, they climbed that like a rabbit. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9681.140000000001s)]
*  I said, what do you mean? [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9684.82s)]
*  No way. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9685.94s)]
*  And they brought some of these guys out. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9686.34s)]
*  They climbed it like. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9688.34s)]
*  And the other thing is you hit it with acid and the thing will disintegrate. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9690.26s)]
*  You know, they have things for concrete. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9693.54s)]
*  So they needed very hardened steel, very special steel. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9695.54s)]
*  And then they did 7,000 pound concrete inside that steel, unit inside that steel. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9698.74s)]
*  And then they have a rebar that's the toughest steel made. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9702.82s)]
*  Very hard to cut. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9708.18s)]
*  So this is why very little is cut. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9709.94s)]
*  I mean, it's right. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9711.7s)]
*  And then they put a anti-climb panel on top. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9712.58s)]
*  I hated it. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9714.82s)]
*  I said, it's so unattractive. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9716.26s)]
*  And I said, why would that work? [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9719.22s)]
*  I don't believe it works. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9720.58s)]
*  And I went to watch the Border Patrol, gave a display. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9721.46s)]
*  We had actually two sets of climbers. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9724.66s)]
*  The guys that climb up walls with drugs on their back. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9727.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, they got like 60, 70 pounds of drug and they go as fast as you can walk. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9730.66s)]
*  They go, bop, bop, bop. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9734.26s)]
*  Or we have Mount Everest type climbers. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9735.86s)]
*  And honestly, the drug guys were much better. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9739.14s)]
*  I couldn't believe. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9741.3s)]
*  The drug guys blew them away, right? [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9742.58s)]
*  But it's true, the anti-climb panel, they couldn't get around it. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9745.22s)]
*  They just couldn't. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9748.58s)]
*  When you didn't have it. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9749.3s)]
*  So sometimes you sacrifice beauty for efficiency. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9751.46s)]
*  And we did. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9755.779999999999s)]
*  So we built this wall and we had, we built over 500 miles of wall. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9756.26s)]
*  That's why we had such good numbers. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9762.82s)]
*  The famous chart that came down very thankfully. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9764.18s)]
*  The chart that came down on my right, Governor, had I not looked over there, [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9767.06s)]
*  I'm not speaking right. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9771.22s)]
*  True. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9772.42s)]
*  You, JD, and we got a lot of great people in this party. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9773.62s)]
*  But it was, I got very lucky, but we had the best numbers we've ever had. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9776.58s)]
*  But I bought, you know, what happens is when you fill it up, it's like water. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9780.66s)]
*  You fill it up. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9783.7s)]
*  Now we have 571 miles of wall. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9784.98s)]
*  And they would always say, you know, when we renovated a wall. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9788.1s)]
*  So there'd be like a piece of plywood sitting there for 60 years. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9791.86s)]
*  Or a two by four sitting for 60 years on the ground and rotting. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9797.22s)]
*  Because, you know, and they'll say, you didn't build a new wall. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9802.34s)]
*  Here we're building 50 feet up in the air and 30 feet sections, 50 foot sections, [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9805.54s)]
*  all steel, all concrete, all everything. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9810.66s)]
*  And all, by the way, they don't even want me to say this, [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9812.66s)]
*  but what the hell, doesn't take that long time. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9815.14s)]
*  They're all wired for all of the equipment. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9817.54s)]
*  We put wires in everything so they can easily wire for all the [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9819.54s)]
*  different types of equipment. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9823.14s)]
*  And if there's a doubt, we have to wire. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9824.42s)]
*  Whenever we just look, you just find the wires all over the place up top. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9827.14s)]
*  So we could just hook it up. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9830.98s)]
*  We don't have to have wires on the outside, which wouldn't do too well. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9832.66s)]
*  Right? [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9836.34s)]
*  So anyway, so we built an extra 200 miles of wall. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9836.9s)]
*  And the governor wanted to buy it. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9842.82s)]
*  He tried to buy it and they wouldn't sell it to him. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9844.34s)]
*  He wanted to put it up himself. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9846.5s)]
*  Could have been done in three to four weeks. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9847.779999999999s)]
*  200 more miles. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9849.699999999999s)]
*  Because when you do it now, they just keep going further out, further out, [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9850.82s)]
*  further out, getting around. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9854.66s)]
*  So we did an extra 200 miles. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9856.58s)]
*  And it was all bought. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9859.06s)]
*  And they announced that they're not going to put it up. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9862.26s)]
*  And that's when I realized they wanted open borders. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9865.939999999999s)]
*  And that's when I realized that people are going to come pouring through the wall [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9868.18s)]
*  like nobody's ever seen before. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9873.14s)]
*  But you've seen it. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9875.06s)]
*  A lot of you are here because of that. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9876.1s)]
*  I made it my number one issue. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9878.019999999999s)]
*  They all said inflation was the number one issue. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9879.46s)]
*  I said, I disagree. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9881.619999999999s)]
*  I think people coming into our country from prisons and from mental institutions [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9882.58s)]
*  is a bigger issue for the people that I know. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9887.22s)]
*  And I made it my number one. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9889.779999999999s)]
*  I talked about inflation too. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9890.9s)]
*  But you know, how many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost? [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9892.179999999998s)]
*  I'd say it and I'd hit it hard. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9896.66s)]
*  But then I go back to the fact that we don't want criminals coming into our country. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9898.74s)]
*  We don't want the jails of every country in the world virtually [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9903.46s)]
*  being deposited into the United States. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9907.779999999999s)]
*  And that man had to suffer with it. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9909.859999999999s)]
*  And he did an unbelievable job. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9912.179999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you, he was a very popular governor. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9913.939999999999s)]
*  But now he's like an unbeatable governor because of your border policies. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9915.86s)]
*  He was fantastic. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9919.78s)]
*  And he really was. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9921.62s)]
*  Governor Abbott, he's a great man, a great leader. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9925.94s)]
*  But it did make him very more bad. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9931.54s)]
*  You didn't do that for politics. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9934.34s)]
*  You did it because you wanted to do the right thing. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9935.62s)]
*  But I'll tell you, it sure as hell worked for politics too. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9937.140000000001s)]
*  It's self-preservation. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9940.34s)]
*  That's right. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9941.78s)]
*  But yeah, because the people are demanding it. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9942.980000000001s)]
*  The people of Texas are demanding it. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9944.9s)]
*  The people are demanding it all over. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9946.58s)]
*  So anyway, so we built it and they wouldn't let us use it. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9948.02s)]
*  They wouldn't let the governor use it. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9953.46s)]
*  And other governors, they wouldn't let them use it. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9955.06s)]
*  But he was the leader of the pack and did a great job. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9957.539999999999s)]
*  And then we heard about a month ago that not only when they let us use it, [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9960.74s)]
*  they were selling it. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9966.1s)]
*  They were going to sell it for five cents on the dollar. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9966.9s)]
*  Now, five cents on the dollar then, but today it would cost more than twice as much to build [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9969.14s)]
*  because we bought it like six years ago. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9974.42s)]
*  And it was just sitting on the ground. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9977.54s)]
*  And that does not do well for the whole thing. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9979.14s)]
*  But it was just sitting on the ground. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9981.78s)]
*  And I heard about it and I called the governor and I called a lot of people, [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9983.62s)]
*  your attorney general. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9988.18s)]
*  And here's the story. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9990.18s)]
*  They were going to buy it. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9992.34s)]
*  And these are great business people. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9993.460000000001s)]
*  They were going to buy it for five cents. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9995.38s)]
*  So they were calling us up. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=9997.78s)]
*  We'll sell it to you for 200 cents on the dollar. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10000.26s)]
*  In other words, it will cost you twice as much. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10003.699999999999s)]
*  So it's 200 cents on the dollar. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10006.82s)]
*  I said, can someone explain that to a judge? [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10009.699999999999s)]
*  I mean, how corrupt is that? [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10012.82s)]
*  You'd think they'd say maybe we'll sell it to you for 20 cents, 30 cents, but not 200 cents. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10014.82s)]
*  So they were going to buy something for five cents and they were going to sell it to us [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10023.779999999999s)]
*  for a fortune. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10028.26s)]
*  They're going to make it would be they'd have it down that in Fortune magazine, [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10028.82s)]
*  they'd put it of the deal of the year. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10032.74s)]
*  Okay. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10034.58s)]
*  You buy something like that. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10035.699999999999s)]
*  But it was so corrupt and so horrible. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10036.9s)]
*  And when we told that to the administration, they didn't care. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10039.699999999999s)]
*  They just kept going forward. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10042.74s)]
*  They couldn't care less. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10044.02s)]
*  And they kept going forward. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10046.02s)]
*  They knew that they were trying to sell it back to us. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10047.22s)]
*  They would have sold it back to us. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10049.38s)]
*  You would have ended up buying it. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10050.58s)]
*  You would have paid probably 50, 60 cents, who knows? [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10051.699999999999s)]
*  But they're going to use it for scrap metal. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10055.38s)]
*  But then they made a much better deal. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10057.14s)]
*  They could just buy it and sell it to us for 15, 20 times what they paid, 20 times. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10058.58s)]
*  Think of it like 20 times what they paid. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10063.86s)]
*  And we wouldn't let it happen. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10066.98s)]
*  And the governor with his attorney general, Ken Paxson, they made a fantastic, [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10069.3s)]
*  they're a good lawyer. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10075.539999999999s)]
*  He's pretty he's pushing around pretty good by people. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10077.86s)]
*  Right? [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10080.02s)]
*  I said, you got that you got a great attorney general. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10080.66s)]
*  They should leave him alone. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10083.14s)]
*  He was with me. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10084.42s)]
*  And but Ken and the governor went to court. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10086.1s)]
*  And a judge actually became incensed and actually called for an investigation. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10088.58s)]
*  How could a thing like this happen? [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10093.14s)]
*  So he stopped it. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10095.22s)]
*  So we're waiting to put that wall up. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10096.5s)]
*  And now that you have a new president, that wall will go up so fast. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10098.1s)]
*  The governor will come. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10102.98s)]
*  This is Greg Abbott, sir. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10105.22s)]
*  Please, the wall is going up too fast. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10107.06s)]
*  Please don't do that. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10109.46s)]
*  You know the story about winning. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10111.06s)]
*  No, no, we're going to win too much. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10112.42s)]
*  We're winning too much. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10114.26s)]
*  Please. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10115.3s)]
*  People always love that one. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10116.18s)]
*  We'll do this with the wall. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10117.14s)]
*  Governor Abbott calls, sir, the wall is going up too fast. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10118.74s)]
*  We can't take it. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10121.939999999999s)]
*  We just can't take it. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10122.74s)]
*  No, I think you'll be very happy if the wall goes up too fast. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10123.859999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10127.06s)]
*  But we'll get that dude. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10128.099999999999s)]
*  We'll work with you on that. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10129.06s)]
*  But it was a great decision by a great Texas judge. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10130.019999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10133.14s)]
*  And it was beautiful. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10133.939999999999s)]
*  Beautiful to watch. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10135.46s)]
*  We see stop them right in their track. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10136.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, they were literally loading the stuff under trucks. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10138.18s)]
*  It was terrible. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10140.74s)]
*  Honestly, it was terrible. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10141.779999999999s)]
*  And he wouldn't take it. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10143.619999999999s)]
*  So I'm so glad I mentioned that they have a really good governor in Texas. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10144.58s)]
*  And I swear I didn't know he was here. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10148.66s)]
*  I swear to you. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10150.9s)]
*  It sounds like a setup. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10151.78s)]
*  I didn't know you were there. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10153.46s)]
*  Did I get lucky? [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10155.14s)]
*  I said the right thing. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10156.26s)]
*  Because there were been moments when I wasn't so happy with him, you know? [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10157.86s)]
*  But not too many, I can tell you that. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10161.78s)]
*  So anyway, it's good to see you too, Governor. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10163.62s)]
*  Great. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10165.539999999999s)]
*  But I just want to thank everybody. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10166.42s)]
*  You've been incredibly recognized, so many of you. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10167.94s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10170.98s)]
*  But this has been a long journey. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10172.18s)]
*  And this was a journey that started in 2015, [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10174.34s)]
*  probably started 20 years before that. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10178.02s)]
*  People used to say, you're going to run for president? [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10179.86s)]
*  You're going to run, run, run? [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10182.02s)]
*  And I always said, no, no, no. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10183.78s)]
*  I don't want. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10186.18s)]
*  And then one day I said, let's give it a shot. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10186.660000000002s)]
*  And what I talked about then was the border too. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10190.980000000001s)]
*  I think it probably was the number one issue for me. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10193.140000000001s)]
*  Back in 2015, 2016, I talked about the border. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10196.5s)]
*  And now I talked about the border. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10200.26s)]
*  But this border is much worse. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10201.62s)]
*  We fixed the border. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10202.820000000002s)]
*  It was totally fixed. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10203.62s)]
*  There was nothing to talk about. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10204.42s)]
*  2020, by the way, that election was totally rigged. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10205.62s)]
*  But these are the, that's okay. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10208.580000000002s)]
*  It was a rigged election. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10210.980000000001s)]
*  You know, the only thing good about it, it showed how bad they are, [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10214.1s)]
*  showed how incompetent. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10217.060000000001s)]
*  And frankly, historically, this is a much bigger event. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10218.26s)]
*  If that would have gone like it should have. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10222.18s)]
*  The only, the bad thing about it is some bad things happened, [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10224.580000000002s)]
*  like a lot of people in our country that wouldn't be in our country right now. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10227.3s)]
*  So, you know, that's the bad part. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10230.259999999998s)]
*  But I will say that it started in 2015, and right from the beginning, [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10233.06s)]
*  when we went to the top, day one, they announced Trump, [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10238.019999999999s)]
*  and Trump went to number one and stayed there for the whole primary. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10242.099999999999s)]
*  And then we took on Hillary. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10245.619999999999s)]
*  She didn't look too happy today. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10249.22s)]
*  We took on Hillary. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10251.779999999999s)]
*  A very nice person. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10253.779999999999s)]
*  But we took on Hillary, and we defeated Hillary, [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10255.46s)]
*  and then we did much better the second time in 2020. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10257.779999999999s)]
*  You know, we got millions more votes. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10262.18s)]
*  We got millions, like 10, 12 million more votes than we did the first time. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10263.699999999999s)]
*  No president has ever gotten that many more votes. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10269.14s)]
*  I got like 9 million more than anybody else had ever gotten. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10271.94s)]
*  And they said, we lost. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10275.619999999999s)]
*  And because of that, I said to Melania, what do you think? [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10277.779999999999s)]
*  And she said, you want to do this again? [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10282.26s)]
*  And had we lost, and had I felt we lost, I wouldn't do it again, [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10285.539999999999s)]
*  because that's like the ultimate poll, right? [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10288.82s)]
*  But I knew how well we did. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10291.3s)]
*  And this time, we made it too big to rig. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10292.74s)]
*  It was so big. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10294.82s)]
*  They tried. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10295.699999999999s)]
*  They tried. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10296.42s)]
*  They tried like hell. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10298.02s)]
*  They tried. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10302.5s)]
*  They tried to do it. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10303.3s)]
*  And last time, they did bad things. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10305.06s)]
*  At this time, they just said, yes. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10307.38s)]
*  You know, I don't know if you saw, Mr. Speaker, in Washington, [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10309.619999999999s)]
*  they had placards. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10313.22s)]
*  They were all set to march. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10314.019999999999s)]
*  They thought it would be closer. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10315.22s)]
*  A gentleman asked me, a very respected gentleman asked me yesterday, [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10318.26s)]
*  how come the polls were so raw? [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10321.699999999999s)]
*  They showed you winning, but not in a landslide. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10324.099999999999s)]
*  I said, because people that are true Trumpers [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10326.9s)]
*  are so angry at the whole polling system and at the writers, the fake news, [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10329.939999999999s)]
*  that they don't want to talk to anybody. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10336.66s)]
*  So when you call somebody from Trump, who are you voting for? [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10338.099999999999s)]
*  They say, it's none of your business. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10342.9s)]
*  I'm not telling you. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10345.460000000001s)]
*  And that was probably 40% of the people they called. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10347.380000000001s)]
*  So they would discard that one, and they didn't show that. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10350.66s)]
*  And then when the election happened, you know, the vote came, [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10355.060000000001s)]
*  and it was much different, much higher than we're going to win. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10358.02s)]
*  But they thought they really thought they couldn't believe the one man said, [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10360.74s)]
*  I mean, it was so much higher. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10364.26s)]
*  We won all seven swing states. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10365.54s)]
*  We won the popular vote by millions of votes, [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10367.62s)]
*  which is hard for a Republican. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10370.18s)]
*  I'll tell you who came through. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10372.1s)]
*  The unions came through. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10373.14s)]
*  The autoworkers were great. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10374.34s)]
*  The teamsters were great. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10375.460000000001s)]
*  The firemen were great. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10376.58s)]
*  I think every almost every union was great. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10378.66s)]
*  The only one that weren't great, although Sean was great, [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10381.220000000001s)]
*  and the teamsters, the head of the Sean O'Brien, [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10385.14s)]
*  the head of the teamsters was fantastic. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10388.42s)]
*  But generally speaking, the head of the union was against Trump, [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10391.14s)]
*  but the union would be with us for like 80, 85%. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10395.460000000001s)]
*  Look what we did with the autoworkers in Michigan. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10399.94s)]
*  Look what we did with the teamsters. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10402.02s)]
*  The teamsters were unbelievable. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10403.94s)]
*  They were a solid Democrat vote, and they voted for Trump. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10405.460000000001s)]
*  So we had a great experience. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10409.86s)]
*  This has been now we have to go to work and get it done [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10411.300000000001s)]
*  because we have to do something that's going to be great. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10413.78s)]
*  We're going to turn our country around, [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10416.1s)]
*  and we're going to turn it around fast. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10419.300000000001s)]
*  And I think this was a better speech than the one I made upstairs. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10421.62s)]
*  Okay? [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10425.300000000001s)]
*  I think this was better, JD. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10426.74s)]
*  I think this was much better, and I got to see my friend. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10430.1s)]
*  So, Governor, take care of yourself. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10434.5s)]
*  You call me, we'll start working. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10436.34s)]
*  You know what that means with him. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10438.9s)]
*  He's going to be calling me tomorrow morning at about six. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10440.1s)]
*  And I said, how about next week? [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10442.82s)]
*  You call me, we're going to get it started real fast. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10445.220000000001s)]
*  We'll really help you a lot. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10447.54s)]
*  You've done a fantastic job protecting something. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10448.82s)]
*  It's not supposed to be for the states. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10451.140000000001s)]
*  And amazing job you've done. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10453.86s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10456.34s)]
*  I want to thank everybody. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10457.38s)]
*  And I have a First Lady who's been incredible. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10459.699999999999s)]
*  I shouldn't say this. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10469.06s)]
*  I'm going to get hell when I say this, [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10470.9s)]
*  but her feet are absolutely aching. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10472.74s)]
*  You know, those heels. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10476.1s)]
*  And we thought we were leaving. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10479.14s)]
*  We were going home. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10481.22s)]
*  Sir, would you be able to go down and say hello [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10482.18s)]
*  to some of your other fans that are here? [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10485.86s)]
*  I said, oh, I didn't know that. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10488.02s)]
*  Well, did you get to see pretty clearly the picture I hope? [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10489.54s)]
*  I thought that's good. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10492.66s)]
*  But because you wouldn't want to make the same speech again, [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10494.58s)]
*  right? [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10497.300000000001s)]
*  But she said, darling, I love you so much, [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10497.86s)]
*  but my feet are killing me. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10500.74s)]
*  I said, honey, let me just see how far does a yes to person. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10502.980000000001s)]
*  Oh, not that long, maybe four or 500 yards. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10507.220000000001s)]
*  That's five football fields. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10509.7s)]
*  I said, can you make it? [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10512.18s)]
*  She said, we're going to make it no matter what. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10513.38s)]
*  We're going to make it because we have to go. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10515.779999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10517.539999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10520.019999999999s)]
*  And then we went out to the helicopter, though, [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10524.5s)]
*  just prior to this, and said goodbye. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10526.58s)]
*  And we said, custom. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10528.5s)]
*  And the wind is blowing like crazy. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10530.339999999998s)]
*  And with the hat that she's wearing, she almost blew away. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10531.859999999999s)]
*  We almost lost her. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10535.46s)]
*  She was being elevated off the ground. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10538.9s)]
*  She almost blew away. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10541.539999999999s)]
*  So we all appreciate it because you've been a great First Lady. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10543.699999999999s)]
*  A beautiful and a great First Lady. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10548.18s)]
*  And they love our First Lady. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10550.74s)]
*  You know, JD, whenever I make a speech, [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10553.539999999999s)]
*  I see hundreds of times, we love our First Lady. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10555.779999999999s)]
*  And they do. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10559.779999999999s)]
*  And they should. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10560.5s)]
*  She's great. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10561.06s)]
*  So I just want to thank you. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10561.939999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10563.3s)]
*  I just want to thank everybody. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10564.34s)]
*  And I felt that I said to JD, should we give them [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10567.22s)]
*  the A treatment, the B treatment, the C, the D, or the F? [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10571.539999999999s)]
*  You know what the F is? [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10575.46s)]
*  Hello, everybody. [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10576.9s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10577.78s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10578.74s)]
*  I gave you the A-plus treatment. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10580.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10582.82s)]
*  Thank you all. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10583.699999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Governor. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10584.74s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10586.02s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10587.46s)]
*  President Donald Trump, they're just making some unscripted remarks to individuals who [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10588.34s)]
*  had been gathered in a separate area of Capitol Hill watching his inauguration because moving [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10606.5s)]
*  the ceremony inside to the Rotunda meant there weren't enough seats to accommodate everyone. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10612.74s)]
*  So there are about 1,800 people watching in Emancipation Hall here in the visitor [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10616.5s)]
*  center. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10621.54s)]
*  We've just heard—it was supposed to be about 10 minutes. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10622.42s)]
*  I think it was about 25 minutes there of remarks from President Donald Trump joking that he [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10625.22s)]
*  was speaking to the younger and far more beautiful crowd downstairs than he had been upstairs. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10631.06s)]
*  And he went through quite a different speech to what we heard upstairs. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10636.82s)]
*  In fact, as I say, this was unscripted and off the cuff, stopping at one point to ask [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10641.86s)]
*  those gathered how his delivery was. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10646.34s)]
*  Was it any good? [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10648.18s)]
*  He said he mentioned the January 6 individuals who have been charged and convicted following [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10649.62s)]
*  the attack on Capitol Hill, of course, in January 2021. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10656.5s)]
*  And he said he would be announcing something on that later, that it was action, not words, [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10661.380000000001s)]
*  and that there would be a lot of action later. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10665.94s)]
*  He singled out two members of the committee, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, individuals [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10669.7s)]
*  on the committee, of course, that we saw President Joe Biden issue preemptive pardons for this [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10675.7s)]
*  morning and President Donald Trump referring to that and referring to the criminal actions [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10681.060000000001s)]
*  of those involved in the committee. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10687.460000000001s)]
*  Of course, those on the committee are not accused, charged or convicted of any criminal [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10688.980000000001s)]
*  actions, those remarks made by the president just now. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10693.54s)]
*  And he also stated once again that the 2020 election was totally rigged. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10696.900000000001s)]
*  Of course, that also is something that there is no evidence for. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10701.140000000001s)]
*  And he went on to talk about the various vote tallies that he had received over the years, [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10705.3s)]
*  referring to his landslide victory. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10710.82s)]
*  He won by two million votes in 2024. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10713.22s)]
*  Joe Biden beating him by seven million votes in 2020. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10716.18s)]
*  President Trump also singling out the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, in the crowd [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10721.86s)]
*  there, expressing his shock that Governor Abbott had watched the ceremony, in fact, [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10727.46s)]
*  from this overflow room and not from the main arena. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10731.54s)]
*  But then he engaged in a long passage of remarks there about his intention to further build [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10734.660000000002s)]
*  the wall along the Mexico-Texas border. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10741.140000000001s)]
*  And of course, we heard him outline a number of remarks and initiatives about that in his [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10744.42s)]
*  inaugural address a little later. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10749.460000000001s)]
*  A split-screen moment going on while we were listening to President Trump there. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10752.34s)]
*  At the same time, you will have been watching pictures of President Biden departing from [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10756.5s)]
*  Air Force Base, Joint Base Andrews, just outside Washington, D.C., here in Maryland. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10762.26s)]
*  And he stopped to make a few remarks at the same time that President Trump was speaking, [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10767.54s)]
*  very brief. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10772.980000000001s)]
*  And he said, we're leaving office, but we're not leaving the fray. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10773.62s)]
*  He encouraged the crowd to stay engaged and take care of each other. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10776.740000000002s)]
*  Then he walked up the stairs of the plane and waved to the crowd. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10780.5s)]
*  And from this moment on, it's all about President Donald Trump. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10784.980000000001s)]
*  You can see him there being swarmed by well-wishers stopping for conversations and photographs [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10788.9s)]
*  and selfies with those gathered in the hall, many of them elected representatives and also [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10795.38s)]
*  supporters and some constituents. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10801.3s)]
*  I want to bring in now Margaret Talley, Senior Contributor for Axios and also the Director of [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10803.619999999999s)]
*  the Institute for Journalism and Democracy at Syracuse University. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10809.46s)]
*  Margaret, we were about to speak to you just before Speaker of the House Mike Johnson began [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10813.3s)]
*  introducing their JD Vance and then Donald Trump. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10817.54s)]
*  A return to form really in those unscripted remarks just now to that gathered crowd and in [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10821.380000000001s)]
*  contrast slightly to what we heard from him earlier. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10826.740000000002s)]
*  I'm glad that we waited because we did get to see the full picture of the messages that [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10830.1s)]
*  now President Trump wanted to send today. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10835.62s)]
*  And you're so right. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10837.94s)]
*  The official remarks, the ones that his team wanted him to give, he talks about American [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10848.1s)]
*  decline being over a golden age, a just beginning. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10856.740000000002s)]
*  He envisions a colorblind society that's merit-based. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10861.78s)]
*  Many of the things he said in that speech are controversial or not unanimous in terms of how [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10866.5s)]
*  Americans might perceive them. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10872.02s)]
*  The idea that there's only going to be two genders according to the federal government [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10873.62s)]
*  now and some of the other issues. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10878.1s)]
*  But go from there to what we just watched afterwards, which as President Trump said was [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10880.820000000002s)]
*  the speech he actually wanted to give all along the relitigation of January the 6th, [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10886.900000000001s)]
*  renewing calls to build the wall, renewing the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10892.58s)]
*  was rigged. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10899.94s)]
*  He said that Hillary Clinton was in the audience and didn't look too happy. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10901.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was just like on and on and on. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10905.14s)]
*  And this gives us perhaps a preview of the challenge or one of the narrative threads [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10908.1s)]
*  that we will be watching. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10913.86s)]
*  He is promising he and his advisors to come out of the gate with something like 100 executive [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10915.3s)]
*  orders. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10920.42s)]
*  He wants to take immediate steps to get things done. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10920.82s)]
*  But he will be pulled by his own instinct to relitigate the past, to go after his grievances [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10923.62s)]
*  and kind of to hold court. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10930.58s)]
*  And it's hard to move fast and look backward at the same time. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10932.18s)]
*  One other thing I note, I was really interested in this part in this impromptu remarks. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10936.5s)]
*  He disputed the idea that inflation was truly the issue that was driving Americans to the polls [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10940.82s)]
*  when he won the election in November. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10947.14s)]
*  Said he doesn't really think inflation was the number one issue. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10949.38s)]
*  He thinks it's the border. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10951.86s)]
*  That's not what polling tells us. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10953.62s)]
*  What polling tells us is that the big unifying lead bipartisan issue for voters was their [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10955.14s)]
*  dissatisfaction over inflation and the price of goods and the diminished value of the money. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10962.1s)]
*  And that border issues were much more of a top concern just for the Republican base. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10968.18s)]
*  But if this is, I would take note of the fact that he's saying that. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10974.18s)]
*  I think he's saying it for a reason. [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10978.42s)]
*  One is going to be maybe harder to decline inflation now that he's in office than it was [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10980.26s)]
*  to talk about declining inflation on the campaign trail. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10985.460000000001s)]
*  But the other is that we're going to see a lot of emphasis on immigration in these early days [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10989.14s)]
*  and weeks of the administration on expanding executive power to make swift immigration moves [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=10994.5s)]
*  without congressional votes. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11000.5s)]
*  And I think his comments here sort of presaged this series of orders and moves that are about [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11004.9s)]
*  to start unfolding. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11013.38s)]
*  And given that we've learned a little bit more on both of those occasions that we've heard from [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11016.82s)]
*  President Trump today about just what he intends, of course, there's a third set of remarks coming [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11021.22s)]
*  a little bit later when he goes to the Capital One arena where 20,000 of his supporters have [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11025.7s)]
*  gathered for the presidential parade that will be now indoors. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11031.14s)]
*  And they will hear from President Trump there as well. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11034.9s)]
*  Stay with us there, Margaret. I'll be back to you in a moment. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11038.26s)]
*  But I want to go over to Riyadh now to our chief international correspondent, Lise Doucet. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11040.5s)]
*  Lise, you were listening into the inaugural address earlier to see just what he might say [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11045.22s)]
*  in relation to the Middle East and that broader foreign policy. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11049.859999999999s)]
*  And, of course, he discussed the deal, mentioning that some hostages had already been released, [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11053.06s)]
*  and there was a standing ovation to that. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11058.26s)]
*  What did you make of what he said? [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11060.58s)]
*  It was very interesting. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11065.78s)]
*  And you've been emphasizing this already, Katrina, in this special is that this was very much an [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11066.58s)]
*  emphasis on America first, make American great again, the golden era starts here. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11072.26s)]
*  And you remember that before, during the election campaign, he said, I want to stop all the wars, [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11077.94s)]
*  not start them, because I want to concentrate on issues at home. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11083.78s)]
*  And so not a lot of time was spent in what was regarded as quite a long inauguration speech, [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11087.62s)]
*  but he repeated again that he wanted to stop wars. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11093.300000000001s)]
*  And then suddenly remembered that just the day before on the 19th, [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11096.18s)]
*  that people had made good on his threat that they had to do a deal, [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11100.660000000002s)]
*  that there had to be a Gaza ceasefire, hostages had to start coming home [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11104.34s)]
*  before he entered the White House again. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11108.58s)]
*  And so it was. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11111.140000000001s)]
*  And he took aim at the Biden administration in saying this spending of unlimited amounts of [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11112.58s)]
*  our money to defend foreign borders abroad when we can't even defend our borders at home [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11120.9s)]
*  has got to stop. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11127.22s)]
*  He emphasized how he said, we want to be the strongest military in the world. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11128.66s)]
*  We want to be respected and admired. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11134.1s)]
*  But we don't want to be one again, we want to end wars, and we don't want to start them. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11136.66s)]
*  In other words, the message he seems to be saying is, [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11141.38s)]
*  as he will believe he did with his just by the power of his words [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11145.46s)]
*  and the presence of his envoy, Steve Witkoff, at the table, [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11150.98s)]
*  he was able to bring about a deal and didn't have to use force. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11155.06s)]
*  I think he's hoping that simply the threat of American military might. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11158.259999999998s)]
*  And of course, he described himself as a peacemaker, a unifier. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11162.9s)]
*  He didn't mention his ambition to get a Nobel Peace Prize. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11166.9s)]
*  But he must think that it is by virtue of this that they can make progress in ending the wars, [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11170.66s)]
*  not just in the Middle East, of course, he would be referring to Ukraine [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11176.74s)]
*  and to any other parts of the world where there are conflicts, [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11180.26s)]
*  where the United States of America has some kind of presence and can have some kind of sway. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11183.380000000001s)]
*  So it's quite clear, at least what he wants to see. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11189.62s)]
*  But we've been saying repeatedly, Katriona, [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11193.060000000001s)]
*  it's going to be a lot more difficult once he gets on with the job. [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11196.02s)]
*  He's going to find out that being a peacemaker, as he wants to be, [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11198.66s)]
*  it's a lot more difficult once you get down to the detail. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11202.74s)]
*  And Lise, it's interesting you mentioned there the idea of American military [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11207.78s)]
*  money being spent to secure borders elsewhere. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11212.1s)]
*  We heard from President Trump in the rally yesterday. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11215.06s)]
*  He was querying why the US was paying so much money [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11217.86s)]
*  towards Afghanistan and other countries for their stability. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11220.9s)]
*  How do you think all of these remarks are being received in the capitals, [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11224.26s)]
*  in the region where you are now? [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11227.78s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11232.34s)]
*  He mentioned yesterday he wants all the American military equipment back. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11233.220000000001s)]
*  The Taliban have been very proudly performing parades [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11237.54s)]
*  with all of their shiny military equipment that was left behind in the withdrawal [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11240.820000000002s)]
*  that President Trump has lambasted President Biden so many times for. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11245.140000000001s)]
*  I mean, never mind that it was President Trump who started that speedy withdrawal. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11250.74s)]
*  It's just that Biden finished it and finished it more quickly than perhaps he should. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11255.86s)]
*  Well, that's what many believe. [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11260.18s)]
*  And the evidence is there to corroborate that because it was a disaster. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11261.78s)]
*  It was a debacle for the United States, which has left a very lasting legacy, [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11266.82s)]
*  including that military equipment that President Trump says now he wants back. [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11271.300000000001s)]
*  He's even said he wants to take back the military air base at Bagram [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11275.78s)]
*  so that America has another position in the region. [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11279.78s)]
*  In Afghanistan, which, of course, America wants to forget about, [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11283.06s)]
*  President Biden didn't want to talk about it at all after the pullout, [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11286.42s)]
*  there are many who are now hoping. [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11292.019999999999s)]
*  The National Security Adviser, Mike Walsh, is a veteran of the Afghan war. [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11294.74s)]
*  They're hoping that America will engage there again. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11298.66s)]
*  But I think it won't be the top of his priorities. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11302.66s)]
*  And of course, in Ukraine, they're watching very nervously [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11305.38s)]
*  because they know about his close relationship with President Trump. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11308.34s)]
*  And they don't want to have to make territorial concessions. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11311.86s)]
*  But like here, the Ukrainians and I have to say in many parts of the world, [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11314.18s)]
*  they're saying, well, actually, it wasn't working with President Biden. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11319.78s)]
*  There was a minister here in the Gulf when I asked him a few weeks ago, [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11323.62s)]
*  are you are you ready for President Trump? [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11327.7s)]
*  He said, listen, at least someone will at least make decisions. [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11329.62s)]
*  And what they saw with the Gaza ceasefire deal, [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11332.900000000001s)]
*  President Trump being willing to use America's force [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11335.38s)]
*  in a way, power of persuasion, threat of action in a way President Biden didn't. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11340.179999999998s)]
*  They're hoping that this will be used, of course, in a way that benefits them. [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11346.58s)]
*  And it's going to be hard for him to choose between, for example, [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11351.46s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, where I am now. [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11354.5s)]
*  They're saying, if you want us to normalize with Israel, [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11356.5s)]
*  you have to have a path to a Palestinian state. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11359.699999999999s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu would like to normalize with Saudi Arabia, [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11362.82s)]
*  but he doesn't want a Palestinian state. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11365.94s)]
*  He prides he's very proud to boast that he's done everything possible to stop it. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11367.94s)]
*  Okay, please do set. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11374.58s)]
*  Thank you so much for bringing us that analysis and reaction on this day, [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11376.02s)]
*  the inauguration of President Donald Trump. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11379.94s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11382.42s)]
*  Just while we've been speaking to these there, [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11384.1s)]
*  we can see images of the congressional luncheon where these people are ready [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11385.94s)]
*  for the congressional luncheon before President Trump arrives there. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11389.86s)]
*  We've been looking at images. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11393.300000000001s)]
*  We can just see on our screen there, of course, Pete Hegseth, [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11394.82s)]
*  who is the pick for defense secretary. [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11398.26s)]
*  We also see Ivanka Trump there in the front of the shot, [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11401.62s)]
*  to the back of her head. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11405.86s)]
*  You can just see there wearing the beret, speaking to Patrick Clyburn. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11406.74s)]
*  And a number of the other cabinet picks are there. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11410.58s)]
*  Doug Burgum just out of shot, of course, picked as secretary of the interior. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11414.02s)]
*  And that was another issue that we heard Donald Trump focus [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11418.02s)]
*  quite a lot of his inaugural address on rolling back. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11421.220000000001s)]
*  He said a lot of these regulations and his trademark chant, drill, baby, drill. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11424.34s)]
*  I'm not sure those words have ever been heard in an inaugural address before. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11429.140000000001s)]
*  This might be the first time for that. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11432.98s)]
*  But Lise was talking there about the impact of his presidency [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11434.74s)]
*  and his words so far today and what that will mean for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11438.98s)]
*  And we can go now to Russia to speak to our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11444.34s)]
*  Steve, there was a line in the inaugural address, [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11449.78s)]
*  which Lise mentioned there as well, [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11452.34s)]
*  about bringing an end to the defense of foreign borders, [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11454.26s)]
*  that there shouldn't be unlimited funding coming from the US government for that reason. [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11457.7s)]
*  How will this speech have been received, do you think, in Moscow? [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11462.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11469.460000000001s)]
*  There was no mention of Russia or Ukraine or the war in Ukraine. [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11470.1s)]
*  In that inaugural address, yes, Trump did call himself a peacemaker, [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11474.18s)]
*  someone who wants to stop wars and prevent America from getting involved in wars. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11478.26s)]
*  But no clues there about how he's going to help to end the war in Ukraine. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11484.42s)]
*  And I think the things to watch for now will be, [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11490.5s)]
*  when will we get that first phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin? [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11493.94s)]
*  Some reports have suggested it could come within days [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11499.62s)]
*  and possibly a meeting between the two presidents within a few months. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11502.82s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see, now that Donald Trump is in office, [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11508.18s)]
*  what actions are taken. [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11512.34s)]
*  Will his new envoy to Ukraine, to the region, Keith Kellogg, [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11513.779999999999s)]
*  start making trips, start talking to officials? [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11519.3s)]
*  Will we get the contours now of Donald Trump's peace plan, [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11521.38s)]
*  if there is a peace plan yet, for Ukraine? [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11525.779999999999s)]
*  It'll be very interesting. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11528.74s)]
*  But it's clear already that Donald Trump realizes it's not going to be easy [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11529.54s)]
*  to end the war in Ukraine. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11535.140000000001s)]
*  I mean, a few months ago, he was talking about how, basically, [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11537.300000000001s)]
*  he could wave a magic wand and end the war in Ukraine [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11540.980000000001s)]
*  within 24 hours of coming to power. [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11543.54s)]
*  That's gone. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11546.42s)]
*  And now Donald Trump's advisers are talking about several months. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11547.54s)]
*  So the time frame has already slipped. [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11551.220000000001s)]
*  And it's going to be quite difficult, I think, to do something. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11554.02s)]
*  But the Russians, I have to say, are cautiously optimistic [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11557.14s)]
*  that things are going to change to their benefit [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11561.539999999999s)]
*  now that Donald Trump is in the White House. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11564.9s)]
*  Because now America has a president who is ready to engage with Vladimir Putin, [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11567.38s)]
*  ready to speak to Putin on the phone, ready to meet Putin. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11572.58s)]
*  Joe Biden wasn't prepared to do that for the last three years. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11577.859999999999s)]
*  He thought that would send the wrong signal about the war in Ukraine. [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11581.22s)]
*  And also, the Kremlin knows that America now has a president [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11585.94s)]
*  who, on the campaign trail, never voiced public criticism of Vladimir Putin, [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11589.62s)]
*  despite Russia's war in Ukraine. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11595.94s)]
*  And just a few days ago, Donald Trump actually came out [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11598.02s)]
*  and expressed sympathy with Russia's opposition to Ukraine [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11600.66s)]
*  ever becoming a member of NATO. [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11604.58s)]
*  That is the source of optimism, I think, for the Kremlin. [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11607.78s)]
*  Okay. Steve Rosenberg there in Moscow, our Russia editor. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11612.019999999999s)]
*  Thank you for joining us with that analysis. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11617.38s)]
*  And of course, we'll see how this all unfolds over the days, [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11619.619999999999s)]
*  weeks, months and years ahead. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11623.46s)]
*  I want to go back to our panelists now. [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11625.38s)]
*  Rodney Davis, former Republican congressman from Illinois, [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11627.539999999999s)]
*  and Stephanie Murphy, former Democratic congresswoman from Florida. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11631.06s)]
*  Rodney, to you first. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11634.66s)]
*  You were watching that speech. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11636.099999999999s)]
*  You've managed to make your way out to the camera there. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11637.46s)]
*  What's your reaction or response to what you heard from President Donald Trump? [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11640.02s)]
*  Well, I think Donald Trump gave a speech that was a lot more disciplined [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11646.74s)]
*  than what I thought it would be. [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11650.26s)]
*  I figured he would add lib a little more like he did at the RNC, [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11651.380000000001s)]
*  make that speech a little longer. [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11655.380000000001s)]
*  But he stuck to the script. [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11657.140000000001s)]
*  Not only went off the script when he went and spoke to a bunch of supporters [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11658.98s)]
*  in an overflow room afterwards, but he stuck to the script. [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11662.26s)]
*  And when he mentioned drill, baby drill, [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11665.7s)]
*  there's probably not one thing more that American can do to lower the inflationary pressures [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11668.18s)]
*  than to become energy independent, to continue to grow our energy sources and export them. [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11676.34s)]
*  So that was one instance among many others where I thought he was doing his best during [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11681.78s)]
*  that short speech to address the top issues that the voters who said they voted for him [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11687.54s)]
*  and for JD Vance and Republicans to have the House and the Senate, [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11694.18s)]
*  he spoke directly to those supporters, [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11697.94s)]
*  which is exactly what every president does during their inaugural speech. [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11700.26s)]
*  There are a couple of surprises in there as well. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11706.66s)]
*  Sorry, Rodney, just kind of interviews there alongside you with Donald Trump [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11709.94s)]
*  doing a signing ceremony in Capitol Hill. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11713.54s)]
*  Of course, some of this is what they have to do once someone has become president. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11716.5s)]
*  There's official work, but let's have a listen in to see just what he's signing [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11721.140000000001s)]
*  and see if he tells us what he's out there. [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11725.140000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11728.26s)]
*  The next one will be 47 sub cabinet level. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11730.42s)]
*  So [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11736.42s)]
*  so what we're watching there is President Donald Trump signing some of the official [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11754.820000000002s)]
*  documents that have to be signed when you become president. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11760.1s)]
*  It's making the official nominations for those who will be in his cabinet. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11763.22s)]
*  So we've been talking for the last few weeks and months about the individuals [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11767.859999999999s)]
*  that he has picked to serve alongside them alongside him. [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11771.38s)]
*  They then have been having hearings in the last week with senators grilling many of them, [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11774.82s)]
*  in fact, as to as to what qualifications they have and what they may bring to the position. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11780.26s)]
*  And now that Donald Trump is officially president, he's making those nominations official. [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11784.74s)]
*  So the official part of that process can happen and votes can be held. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11789.22s)]
*  And we were hearing from Senator Ron Johnson in Wisconsin a little earlier that [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11794.58s)]
*  he felt there would be at least one vote on one of those nominations held today. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11798.5s)]
*  So we see Donald Trump. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11803.779999999999s)]
*  Let's have a listen in. [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11805.619999999999s)]
*  Can we hear what he's saying? [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11806.42s)]
*  So [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11820.019999999999s)]
*  now on on inauguration day, flags will fly at full mast. [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11822.26s)]
*  That's in relation to [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11826.58s)]
*  when we listen to what he's saying. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11830.42s)]
*  What's his name? [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11832.02s)]
*  Put yourself in the center. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11832.82s)]
*  That's something [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11835.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11839.220000000001s)]
*  Good acoustics. [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11841.460000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11842.66s)]
*  All right. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11843.300000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11843.94s)]
*  We go to the mic. [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11844.9s)]
*  Great. [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11845.86s)]
*  Very good. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11846.66s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11847.460000000001s)]
*  Take that. [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11849.460000000001s)]
*  Bye bye. [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11850.98s)]
*  That last memo that he just signed there, of course, Jimmy Carter, [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11852.1s)]
*  former president, passed away on the 29th of December. [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11855.460000000001s)]
*  Accordingly, President Joe Biden had ordered that flags be flown at half mast for 60 days. [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11858.58s)]
*  That would take into account today, the inauguration day. [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11865.460000000001s)]
*  But the Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, and indeed the governors of some [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11868.9s)]
*  Republican states, ordered the flags to be flown at full mast. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11872.74s)]
*  So President Donald Trump has just signed an order to make that the official business from here out. [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11875.94s)]
*  Let's try and see if we can hear what else he's saying there. [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11880.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11889.3s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11889.7s)]
*  Should we go to lunch? [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11890.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11891.86s)]
*  Great. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11892.42s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11892.9s)]
*  Okay. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11894.1s)]
*  Time to lunch. [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11896.1s)]
*  Ready for lunch? [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11896.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11897.62s)]
*  Okay. [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11897.86s)]
*  Okay. [[03:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11898.42s)]
*  Okay. [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11899.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11900.019999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11902.019999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11904.019999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11906.019999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11908.019999999999s)]
*  That was three times the number of times you did in 2017, sir. [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11910.019999999999s)]
*  Okay. So President Donald Trump there just holding his first signing ceremony on Capitol Hill. [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11914.019999999999s)]
*  Making some last remarks there. [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11920.82s)]
*  He's saying it's unfortunate that he did that. [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11922.82s)]
*  This is not the time to discuss it. [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11925.619999999999s)]
*  I think it's a reference to one of the final acts of President Joe Biden before he left office, [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11927.62s)]
*  which was issuing some pardons for his siblings, preemptive pardons for his siblings, [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11933.220000000001s)]
*  and also for some other individuals, Anthony Fauci, and also for General Milley, [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11939.220000000001s)]
*  and also for the members of the January 6th Investigation Committee there in the House of Representatives. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11948.02s)]
*  We'll see if he refers to that a little bit later in the remarks that he will be making [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11955.22s)]
*  at the Capitol One arena. [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11959.539999999999s)]
*  What we're looking at now, well, that is the luncheon. [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11961.14s)]
*  So President Trump will be making his way from the room he was just in for that signing ceremony [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11964.9s)]
*  down here for this luncheon with members of Congress. [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11970.019999999999s)]
*  They're all seated there. [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11973.3s)]
*  We were watching a few moments ago as they were moving around the room and talking to each other, [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11974.5s)]
*  all seated at tables there awaiting a luncheon [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11980.66s)]
*  that will be taking place shortly. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11983.86s)]
*  President Trump also expected to make remarks when he gets to that luncheon, [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11987.060000000001s)]
*  but we may not be able to listen in to those. [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11992.18s)]
*  And for those who are interested, I can bring you the menu of this luncheon. [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=11995.78s)]
*  The first course is going to be a Chesapeake crab cake with tomato tartare, [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12000.18s)]
*  bay sauce, pickled vegetables, Romanesco dill and chive oil. [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12005.060000000001s)]
*  The second course will be a Greater Omaha Angus ribeye steak with plenty of vegetables. [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12008.34s)]
*  And the third course, a Minnesota apple icebox terrine with sour cream, ice cream and salted caramel. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12013.62s)]
*  And wines are coming from California and Virginia to go along with that menu at the luncheon there [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12020.5s)]
*  that the members of Congress will be enjoying. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12026.980000000001s)]
*  Just before we brought you those images of the signing ceremony, [[03:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12030.02s)]
*  we were speaking to Rodney Davis and also to Stephanie Murphy. [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12034.02s)]
*  We heard Rodney's reaction to Donald Trump's remarks earlier. [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12039.140000000001s)]
*  Stephanie, just interested in what your view of what Donald Trump was saying earlier today. [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12043.14s)]
*  We've heard from him twice now. [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12049.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think in his official speech, he started with the promise of a golden age [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12052.26s)]
*  and then filled the middle in with the usual comments, a little bit of information, [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12059.38s)]
*  disinformation, and then a little more about his false assertions and some dystopian themes [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12067.3s)]
*  regarding America. [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12075.539999999999s)]
*  And then he finished out with yet again, a promise of a golden age to come. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12076.5s)]
*  And I think that's really the critical piece, right? [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12081.859999999999s)]
*  Is can he reconcile some of the promises that he's made with the golden age? [[03:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12084.019999999999s)]
*  Can he both take Panama by force and be the peacemaker that he has promised? [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12089.14s)]
*  Can he implement severe immigration deportations and impact inflation [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12096.42s)]
*  by not driving up the cost of services in this country? [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12107.94s)]
*  So there are a lot of these contradictions that he laid out within his speech that remain to be seen [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12112.5s)]
*  whether or not he can deliver on it when he is governing. [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12117.3s)]
*  And I think the other thing out there is that he gets to start at what is the hardest [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12120.9s)]
*  for him from a public speaking perspective, which is to stay scripted. [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12126.66s)]
*  And the day will devolve into where he is far more comfortable. [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12131.22s)]
*  I think you got a sample of what you'll see later this evening when he spoke to the supporters. [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12135.14s)]
*  And in the rotunda, he had to kind of stay on script. [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12141.06s)]
*  When you went to speak to the supporters, he got to riff a bit more. [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12145.38s)]
*  And I imagine that by the time he gets to the Capitol, the arena tonight, [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12148.58s)]
*  he will be in full rally mode. [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12152.74s)]
*  OK. And then, of course, after the Capital One arena, he also makes three further addresses [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12157.38s)]
*  to some of those glitzy inaugural balls going late on into the night. [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12163.62s)]
*  So a very busy day for President Donald Trump ahead. [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12168.02s)]
*  We're just looking at those images of the members of Congress, family members of Trump, [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12170.5s)]
*  some of his cabinet picks all gathered there here in Capitol Hill, [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12176.02s)]
*  waiting that congressional luncheon in President Trump's honor. [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12180.02s)]
*  I want to bring in the former governor of Virginia, Jim Gilmore, who was also [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12184.1s)]
*  U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [[03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12188.5s)]
*  under the first Trump administration. [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12192.74s)]
*  Thanks very much for being with us here on BBC News. [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12195.06s)]
*  We were speaking earlier with our correspondents in Ukraine and in the Middle East about just what [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12198.18s)]
*  this Trump administration may mean for those areas. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12203.220000000001s)]
*  He didn't go into a whole lot of detail in his remarks earlier. [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12206.58s)]
*  But what can we expect, do you think? [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12210.66s)]
*  Well, look, I thought that the speech was honest. [[03:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12212.74s)]
*  I thought it was faithful to the things that he'd been saying. [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12215.46s)]
*  Americans sometimes think that politicians say one thing and then forget it when they get elected. [[03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12218.74s)]
*  That's not what President Trump did. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12223.3s)]
*  He spoke exactly to what his priorities were going to be. [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12225.3s)]
*  He put emphasis on the previous administration and the previous party's culture wars that [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12228.82s)]
*  they had been doing and indicating that that was going to stop. [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12234.98s)]
*  I mean, it is true that you can't discriminate in favor of someone without discriminating [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12238.26s)]
*  against someone. [[03:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12242.02s)]
*  And I think that he said that he was going to go back to a merit-based society. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12243.140000000001s)]
*  He was clear about inflation, about the border, and especially about energy policy. [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12247.54s)]
*  So he's doing what he said that he intends to do. [[03:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12252.34s)]
*  The American people voted for a change, no question about that. [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12256.42s)]
*  They could have just kept the course going the same way, but they voted for change. [[03:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12260.42s)]
*  And I think his speech indicated he wanted to be faithful to that. [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12264.1s)]
*  Was there a particular highlight for you? [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12269.220000000001s)]
*  Well, look, I think that the Panama Statement was remarkable. [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12272.5s)]
*  Let's see how that goes. [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12276.5s)]
*  I, of course, have always been an advocate myself for the Ukrainian war. [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12278.58s)]
*  I think that Putin and his aggression must be stopped. [[03:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12283.220000000001s)]
*  I didn't hear anything in the speech that was against that. [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12286.98s)]
*  So let's wait and see how that foreign policy goes. [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12290.34s)]
*  But in the meanwhile, what, for me, the highlight was he laid out carefully [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12293.140000000001s)]
*  the elements of what he thinks he needs to do in order to bring America [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12297.7s)]
*  up to a vision of greatness. [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12301.86s)]
*  And that particularly is energy policy. [[03:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12304.26s)]
*  By the way, if the United States were to actually engage in an aggressive energy policy, [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12306.1s)]
*  that would hurt Putin badly because Putin is not financing his aggression [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12310.820000000002s)]
*  and his fascist war in any way except through oil sales. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12314.900000000001s)]
*  So that's going to be a consequence of President Trump's initiative on energy. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12318.820000000002s)]
*  But I thought that his statement on the culture wars was terrifically important. [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12324.34s)]
*  I thought the American people rejected the culture wars, [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12327.94s)]
*  and I thought that President Trump made it clear that we were going to stop being [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12330.74s)]
*  prejudicial and stop being a favoritism of one group or another. [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12334.34s)]
*  And, Governor Gimel, what did you make of his announcement [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12341.539999999999s)]
*  that he intends to put American astronauts on Mars? [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12344.9s)]
*  Well, listen, that's it's an uplifting sort of idea. [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12348.82s)]
*  I think that that it's a program that's been underway, [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12353.78s)]
*  and he's clearly stated that he wants to continue space exploration, [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12356.98s)]
*  and that's something where America's always led the way. [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12361.3s)]
*  So it's exciting that he would say things like that. [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12364.42s)]
*  But I believe that at the end of the day, [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12367.699999999999s)]
*  his real difference is going to be the changes that he's going to make in domestic policy. [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12370.18s)]
*  You could tell that it was not a gentle speech towards President Biden [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12375.06s)]
*  and his more liberal compatriots. [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12379.38s)]
*  I'm sure that the Clintons were uncomfortable. [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12383.38s)]
*  I didn't see President Obama, but I'm sure he was uncomfortable, [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12385.78s)]
*  because President Trump was being clear that he was going to chart a new course [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12388.66s)]
*  and go in a different direction. [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12393.380000000001s)]
*  Once again, I think that the American people had a choice, and that's what they chose. [[03:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12395.220000000001s)]
*  So I think he's being honest and faithful about his direction. [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12399.220000000001s)]
*  And indeed, there were moments when it felt like a State of the Union address, [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12404.900000000001s)]
*  almost this morning, didn't it, [[03:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12408.34s)]
*  where the Republicans who were in support of what he said were jumping to their feet and clapping, [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12409.94s)]
*  and the Democrats, and indeed many of those past presidents you mentioned, [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12414.5s)]
*  were seated and quite stony-faced throughout. [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12417.86s)]
*  How will President Trump move now to unite this country, which is still so polarized? [[03:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12422.18s)]
*  I think you're going to have to talk to the American people. [[03:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12428.02s)]
*  The Democratic Party is pretty set in their ways in terms of their culture wars [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12430.66s)]
*  and their climate change issues as predominant things. [[03:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12436.26s)]
*  I think that we all have to ask the question, [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12440.82s)]
*  why should the United States be wrecking their economy because of culture change or climate change [[03:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12442.58s)]
*  when countries like China and others around the world continue to dirty the air? [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12448.74s)]
*  Why should it not be an equal type of situation? [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12453.22s)]
*  Why should it be a double standard to the detriment of Americans? [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12456.82s)]
*  I think that's what this president is really talking about. [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12461.78s)]
*  So I'm pretty happy about the talk. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12465.3s)]
*  And yes, it did sound a little like a State of the Union address. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12468.34s)]
*  But no, I think that it was an inaugural address. [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12471.22s)]
*  I think he was setting out exactly what his hopes and aspirations are, [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12473.38s)]
*  what he intends to do in his four years. [[03:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12476.74s)]
*  That was very clear. [[03:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12479.14s)]
*  Okay. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12482.5s)]
*  Former Governor of Virginia, Jim Gilmore, thank you very much for joining us here on BBC News. [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12483.3s)]
*  While we've been speaking to Jim Gilmore there, [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12490.58s)]
*  we've been looking at images of that luncheon which is just about to get underway in Capitol Hill here. [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12492.74s)]
*  A lot happening, a lot still to come, so many set pieces to this day and so many new moments as well [[03:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12499.539999999999s)]
*  by virtue of moving it inside. [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12506.66s)]
*  So let's reflect now on one of the key moments of the inauguration day, [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12508.9s)]
*  of course the inaugural address. [[03:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12512.9s)]
*  We've been discussing it here and in it. [[03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12514.58s)]
*  President Donald Trump issued a promise to the American people and to the world. [[03:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12516.58s)]
*  He said the golden age of America begins right now. [[03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12521.3s)]
*  Here are some of the highlights of his speech. [[03:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12524.9s)]
*  From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12529.14s)]
*  We will be the envy of every nation and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12535.779999999999s)]
*  During every single day of the Trump administration, [[03:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12544.1s)]
*  I will very simply put America first. [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12547.859999999999s)]
*  Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. [[03:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12559.619999999999s)]
*  Our safety will be restored. [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12564.26s)]
*  The scales of justice will be rebalanced. [[03:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12566.9s)]
*  The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12571.22s)]
*  And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous and free. [[03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12577.86s)]
*  All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12585.060000000001s)]
*  and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. [[03:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12592.1s)]
*  We will re-establish the freedom of the people of America. [[03:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12598.34s)]
*  We will bring the freedom of the people of America back to the places from which they came. [[03:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12602.02s)]
*  We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy. [[03:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12606.74s)]
*  I will end the practice of catch and release. [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12617.460000000001s)]
*  And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12624.82s)]
*  We will drill, baby, drill. [[03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12631.939999999999s)]
*  America will be a manufacturing nation once again and we have something that no other [[03:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12652.66s)]
*  manufacturing nation will ever have. [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12658.1s)]
*  The largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth and we are going to use it. [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12660.26s)]
*  We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12671.380000000001s)]
*  and export American energy all over the world. [[03:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12678.42s)]
*  We will be a rich nation again and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it. [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12682.82s)]
*  With my actions today we will end the Green New Deal and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12691.380000000001s)]
*  saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers. [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12698.42s)]
*  So just a few highlights there from President Donald Trump's inaugural address a little later. [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12712.98s)]
*  We're looking now at live pictures. You can see him seated there next to First Lady [[03:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12718.5s)]
*  Melania Trump and also beside her Senator Fischer and on the other side Vice President [[03:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12722.82s)]
*  JD Vance and Second Lady Usa Vance. They are there at the congressional luncheon that will get [[03:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12728.26s)]
*  underway. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Democratic senator who's the head of the [[03:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12736.58s)]
*  presidential inauguration committee just making a few remarks there before this luncheon. You'll [[03:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12741.46s)]
*  see lots of flowers in the room there. We were talking earlier about the menu for today, all of [[03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12746.9s)]
*  those flowers done by a florist in Virginia. So today very much a celebration of all things [[03:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12751.619999999999s)]
*  American as well as a celebration of President Trump himself. Margaret Talaev is still with us, [[03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12757.46s)]
*  senior contributor for ATSIAS and director of Syracuse University's Institute for Democracy, [[03:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12763.22s)]
*  Journalism and Citizenship. Margaret, we were talking earlier about some of these remarks from [[03:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12767.94s)]
*  Donald Trump and there have been a lot of markers I guess of what we can expect from him that he's [[03:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12773.7s)]
*  going to do for the rest of the day. We know he's going to sign some documents at that event at the [[03:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12781.62s)]
*  Capital One arena and then others when he reaches the Oval Office at the White House and it would [[03:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12787.62s)]
*  seem from what he said that immigration policies are going to be top of the agenda. [[03:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12792.42s)]
*  Yes, that's right. And you know, I mean there's been a buildup for this for several weeks. At [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12798.34s)]
*  first we were hearing dozens, then it was like perhaps 100 today reporting as many as 200. So [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12802.58s)]
*  we'll see precisely how many, but clearly there's sort of a shock and awe plan to come out of day [[03:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12808.18s)]
*  one, laying down very clear markers about his desire to move quickly and decisively to engage [[03:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12815.220000000001s)]
*  sort of emergency actions to declare a border emergency, kind of revert to those COVID era [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12822.42s)]
*  policies that allowed him to, that allowed the U.S. government to set aside their normal procedures [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12830.42s)]
*  and treat someone trying to cross into United States differently because of what was at the [[03:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12837.78s)]
*  time a health emergency. Now that COVID emergency is, I mean it's no longer active the same way it [[03:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12843.86s)]
*  was during the spike in COVID cases, but a lot of what President Trump is going to do by way of [[03:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12850.98s)]
*  order is entirely likely to be litigated. There will be legal challenges to it and then it will [[03:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12860.74s)]
*  be up to the Supreme Court. So you saw today the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, [[03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12866.58s)]
*  attend to President Trump's swearing in. You saw Brett Kavanaugh, who is another [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12873.38s)]
*  Trump nominee to the high court, attend to Vice President J.D. Vance's swearing in. [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12877.939999999999s)]
*  If you are one of the nine members of the court, including those two who were in the [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12884.66s)]
*  president and the vice president, you know a lot of this stuff is coming your way between now and [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12888.5s)]
*  the typical end of the court session in June, just a barrage of challenges to the moves that will be [[03:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12894.66s)]
*  initiated. But I think you're right to say those immigration and border emergency type of [[03:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12901.3s)]
*  actions are likely to be the first wave of what we see. I heard many other clues in that [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12909.699999999999s)]
*  official inaugural remarks before the thing to the supporters. And it's interesting because we spent [[03:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12918.099999999999s)]
*  so much of sort of the Biden years thinking of Trump's foreign policy approach as more [[03:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12924.18s)]
*  isolationist. And we really saw in the final weeks of the campaign and certainly these weeks, [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12934.26s)]
*  couple of months since the election, that he does not want to be viewed as isolationist at all. In [[03:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12940.02s)]
*  fact, expansionist is more the word that I would use to describe [[03:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12946.74s)]
*  the [[03:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12954.18s)]
*  many of the initiatives he teased today, everything from planting the stars and stripes on Mars [[03:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12963.7s)]
*  to Eidel McKinley saying that he wants to rename Mount McKinley, Mount McKinley after the Obama [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12969.380000000001s)]
*  administration made it Denali. And highlighting this issue with the Panama Canal, which was, [[03:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12975.7s)]
*  of course, U.S. built canal turned an agreement to turn it over to Panama under the late president [[03:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12983.7s)]
*  Jimmy Carter's administration and President Trump saying, I want it back. I want it back now. [[03:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12992.18s)]
*  McKinley himself was a certainly an expansionist president, but also presided over major tariffs. [[03:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=12998.02s)]
*  And McKinley drew some criticism actually for more than expansionism, for imperialism [[03:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13007.46s)]
*  toward his approach to the Philippines. So interesting to see [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13013.699999999999s)]
*  President Trump elevate McKinley today. I think there's some symbolism there. [[03:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13018.66s)]
*  Okay, we've just pulled away from the congressional luncheon there because the rest of it is private at [[03:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13025.699999999999s)]
*  this point. They'll have their luncheon there. And shortly after that, President Donald Trump will [[03:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13031.06s)]
*  make his way to the Capitol One arena to greet those supporters who have been watching proceedings [[03:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13036.42s)]
*  on a big screen there. I want to bring in James Rosebush, former deputy assistant to President [[03:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13041.460000000001s)]
*  Ronald Reagan and former chief of staff to First Lady Nancy Reagan. James, we were speaking early [[03:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13045.7s)]
*  this morning how it was Ronald Reagan who had kind of transformed the inauguration and brought that [[03:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13050.74s)]
*  kind of Hollywood glamour to it and made it into the show and the ceremony that we're used to seeing [[03:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13055.14s)]
*  now. I'm interested to get your view of what you've seen so far of this year's inauguration. [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13060.26s)]
*  So that was the entertainment part of the inauguration we were talking about earlier. [[03:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13066.66s)]
*  So in terms of the substantive part, you remember I worked for a president who was called the great [[03:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13070.98s)]
*  communicator. So Reagan in his speech is in the first inaugural he was ranked as having the the [[03:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13076.58s)]
*  highest quality speech. Now if you go back and I've had the reason and a reason to do this over the [[03:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13084.34s)]
*  past couple of weeks, I read through every inaugural address and I can tell you that by far [[03:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13089.3s)]
*  at least probably 80 percent of these addresses are not important. They're not memorable and [[03:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13096.5s)]
*  they're also rather boring I would say. So you have the the ones that stick out which are exceptional [[03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13104.74s)]
*  and that would include of course our first president General Washington who mostly was [[03:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13113.78s)]
*  saying that he wasn't really planning on accepting this responsibility and he felt a great deal of [[03:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13120.34s)]
*  humility about it and had a lot of grace about it. And then when you consider the fact that [[03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13127.54s)]
*  Lincoln's both of Lincoln's addresses were considered a very high quality where Lincoln was [[03:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13132.900000000001s)]
*  asking for the return of fellowship and support for one another after and during the terrible war [[03:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13140.58s)]
*  and he did it with such grace because you remember that Lincoln grew up with only two books. He was [[03:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13150.9s)]
*  very poor. He had two books, one the collected works of Shakespeare and two the Bible and that [[03:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13158.9s)]
*  had a big impact on the way Lincoln communicated both verbally and in words. So those were highly [[03:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13164.98s)]
*  memorable. You have also the first address of Roosevelt which was very precise in describing [[03:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13171.859999999999s)]
*  the condition of the U.S. economy at that time in particular and the growing animosity among the West [[03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13182.34s)]
*  and those were important things for him to refer to. And then of course you have some speeches that [[03:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13190.5s)]
*  have memorable phrases that people can use in their own speeches or even in instruction in schools. So [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13198.26s)]
*  you have Kennedy's don't ask what your government could do for you but what you can do for your [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13205.22s)]
*  country. Of course that's highly memorable. So we look for things like this in great speeches [[03:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13210.5s)]
*  and speeches that are useful and I would say by and large inaugural speeches have not been [[03:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13216.18s)]
*  memorable and they've not been particularly useful and they have been I would say more [[03:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13223.14s)]
*  in the generalist category perhaps almost shy of wanting to be as assertive in terms of policy [[03:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13228.58s)]
*  that perhaps they could have been. Now you have a completely different kind of inaugural address [[03:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13236.98s)]
*  with President Trump. So you see that he's reflected and every president is reflected in [[03:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13244.18s)]
*  their not only the address that is written for them and they may be editing but of course the [[03:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13252.980000000001s)]
*  way they present it as well. So it's not only the written message but it's the verbal message and [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13258.5s)]
*  also remember that 60 percent of all the power of communication is non-verbal. So there's a lot of [[03:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13264.660000000002s)]
*  people are looking for actually the spirit in which any kind of talk or any [[03:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13272.1s)]
*  speech is given. So let's go to this one that we've heard today. So this reflects a man of action. [[03:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13278.9s)]
*  This is a person who exactly what he intends to do and this is different than what we've heard [[03:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13285.460000000001s)]
*  before and perhaps it reflects more of almost an anxiety that he feels Americans feel about the [[03:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13291.140000000001s)]
*  very different kinds of situations that America has been in over the past several years and he [[03:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13300.1s)]
*  wants to be the chief fixer and perhaps he will be the chief fixer but this is what he wants to [[03:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13307.380000000001s)]
*  communicate. He's not a prosaic person. He's not a person who's going to be metaphysical in terms of [[03:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13313.86s)]
*  his description of America and America's role in the world in more of a spiritual sense but a very [[03:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13322.26s)]
*  much pragmatic one and this will be accepted and lauded by a lot of people who want to see [[03:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13330.66s)]
*  action taken and they want to see specific action taken and so what he's really given America is a [[03:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13337.54s)]
*  policy speech and a promise. This is what I'm going to do so watch me. This is very different than what [[03:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13343.54s)]
*  we've had in the past where we've had people who have been perhaps charged with bringing people [[03:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13350.34s)]
*  together or especially in the case of America. I was at a dinner recently where the honoree was [[03:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13356.34s)]
*  the grandson of Winston Churchill and we had a lovely conversation and he had brought his nephew [[03:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13366.26s)]
*  who was in his early 20s and he stood up during the very cooperative and pleasant conversation [[03:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13373.06s)]
*  we were having and he said well what's so great about America anyway? I don't understand it and [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13379.46s)]
*  so I made a few comments and I said well this is what's unique about America and that America [[03:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13385.619999999999s)]
*  was created and this is the vision that Reagan adopted and communicated that America was put here [[03:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13392.5s)]
*  to bring freedom to the entire world and so we went on just very briefly about that and he said [[03:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13399.539999999999s)]
*  oh now I get it. So I would say that most inaugural speeches aim to restore Americans faith [[03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13405.78s)]
*  and conviction about their own country and I think that if you... Okay I think that is [[03:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13416.42s)]
*  sorry for interrupting you James there but I think that is what we were hearing from President Trump [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13423.86s)]
*  Cathy Kaye is with us here and Cathy we heard almost two different well we did hear two different [[03:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13428.66s)]
*  speeches from Donald Trump and the day is young and I know we're not we still have I think five [[03:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13434.02s)]
*  more speeches from him to come and but we heard that very sort of presidential traditional inaugural [[03:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13438.42s)]
*  address but with a lot of policy points in it as well earlier and then the unscripted remarks was [[03:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13443.54s)]
*  more classic Trump but we still learned quite a lot about what he has in mind with this country. [[03:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13449.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah I mean the unscripted part was more about his grievances we would have won California we [[03:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13453.62s)]
*  would have won the 20th election the people that have been pardoned by Joe Biden so some of the [[03:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13458.18s)]
*  kind of more conventional Trump in that way I mean even the inaugural address was not that [[03:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13464.18s)]
*  conventional in the sense that you don't often get a president standing there at inauguration [[03:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13469.78s)]
*  saying they're going to take the Panama Canal I haven't heard that before for example or rename [[03:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13473.78s)]
*  the Gulf of Mexico so there's with Trump I think it's always worth and one thing I learned from [[03:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13479.220000000001s)]
*  having covered him the first time is to really make a distinction between what he says and what [[03:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13484.58s)]
*  he does so there will be a lot of attention out of this inaugural address on the Panama Canal I [[03:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13489.06s)]
*  just mentioned it on the Gulf of Mexico but what's going to happen actually in terms of economic [[03:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13493.7s)]
*  policy what is he going to do about those tariffs what's going to happen for the American people [[03:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13499.06s)]
*  in terms of bringing down prices which was a big reason why he was elected we've heard a lot about [[03:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13502.66s)]
*  the cultural issues and we saw that during the address he addressed that and that got a big round [[03:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13506.74s)]
*  of applause but so far we don't know what the economic plan is yet what's he actually going [[03:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13510.9s)]
*  to do to bring those prices down which is why a lot of Americans voted for him and we may have to [[03:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13516.66s)]
*  wait you know I think with Trump you have to have a certain amount of patience today is kind of as [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13521.46s)]
*  they said shock and awe but let's see what actually comes out of this and on that revenue raising he [[03:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13525.14s)]
*  outlined again in his inaugural address which is kind of unusual to do this what he calls an external [[03:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13530.26s)]
*  revenue service where he's going to make other countries pay into this fund on taxes on tariffs [[03:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13534.82s)]
*  that he said he's sick of the American people their tax money going elsewhere yes although what we [[03:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13542.02s)]
*  haven't had yet and and there are several more hours left and we've got to get to the capital arena [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13547.779999999999s)]
*  where he's going to make a speech and we're not expecting to have is an announcement of 25 percent [[03:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13552.34s)]
*  tariffs for example on Mexico and Canada on day one or 10 across the board tariffs on all imports [[03:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13557.3s)]
*  into the United States and I think what's happening my understanding from talking to people [[03:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13563.78s)]
*  around Trump is that there is a debate going on within the economic team about how quickly to [[03:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13568.02s)]
*  roll out those tariffs and what the scale of them is going to be in the end clearly President Trump [[03:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13572.02s)]
*  likes them but there is also the risk that they the speech as Stephanie Murphy was saying there [[03:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13577.060000000001s)]
*  are contradictions in this speech that he was elected to bring down prices jack up tariffs on [[03:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13581.94s)]
*  food America's a food importer you drive up tariffs on proteins coming into the United States [[03:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13587.380000000001s)]
*  you could drive up prices so that's the kind of debate that's happening I think always watch what [[03:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13591.3s)]
*  happens and not what just what is said and he said that himself actually in those remarks the [[03:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13595.22s)]
*  second remark saying actions speak more than words and in reference to those who've been [[03:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13599.939999999999s)]
*  charged and arrested with January 6th offenses yes I mean that's we haven't had the final word on [[03:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13605.3s)]
*  that again today maybe that's going to be said it's coming later coming later so let's watch what [[03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13611.14s)]
*  happens how many of them I thought it was interesting that in those unscripted remarks [[03:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13615.46s)]
*  there was a certain amount of anger towards Joe Biden for the pardons towards his family and [[03:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13620.34s)]
*  towards General Milley and we heard that specifically towards and Dr Fauci and whether [[03:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13625.86s)]
*  that changes his calculation when it comes to January 6th it's possible that he does you know [[03:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13630.9s)]
*  you did this and therefore I can and it is extraordinary for a president minutes before [[03:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13634.82s)]
*  they lose the office of the presidency to pardon preemptively all of their members of their family [[03:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13640.18s)]
*  when Joe Biden himself said he didn't like the look of Donald Trump doing that [[03:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13645.3s)]
*  back in 2020 so when when Donald Trump left office so there's a contradiction there in Joe [[03:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13649.699999999999s)]
*  this is a we're living in an era where power is being consolidated in the executive office and [[03:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13655.539999999999s)]
*  in the office of the presidency and I think you know you see the fruit line there from [[03:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13660.019999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump to Joe Biden did it and now Donald Trump is going to do it again we'll be speaking [[03:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13665.38s)]
*  like this in the the weeks and months ahead so just to ask you briefly on those pardons that [[03:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13669.06s)]
*  Joe Biden issued given as you say what he has said about them in the past is that damaging for [[03:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13674.42s)]
*  the Democrats in terms of the rebuilding that they're trying to do we've seen Joe Biden fly [[03:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13679.22s)]
*  off now and there's no obvious leader for the party well it's interesting that a Democrat actually [[03:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13684.1s)]
*  texted me when those pardons happened said they didn't like the look of this that is not something [[03:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13688.9s)]
*  they like I think they understand the Milley and the Fauci in the January the sixth committee [[03:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13693.38s)]
*  pardons more than they do the pardons of Joe Biden's family I mean the crime narrative [[03:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13698.82s)]
*  around Joe Biden's family which you know there aren't charges against these members of Joe Biden's [[03:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13704.1s)]
*  families there were investigations against one of them from the house Republicans but there [[03:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13708.02s)]
*  haven't been charges that's a narrative that Democrats would like to now move on from as they [[03:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13711.06s)]
*  would like to move on from many things surrounding this president they they will be because that [[03:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13716.02s)]
*  president will be over now it's president Donald Trump now I want to go to Chicago to our news [[03:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13719.7s)]

*  its way through the downtown streets ending up here at Trump Tower itself which is right along [[03:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13759.38s)]

*  concerned about the erosion of LGBTQ rights here as well but top of the agenda as you mentioned [[03:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13780.58s)]
*  obviously is immigration and the policy of Donald Trump which we've already started to see being [[03:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13785.7s)]
*  rolled out now with those executive actions and executive orders having to do with the border [[03:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13790.66s)]

*  speaking with them are undocumented themselves so folks saying you know it's important that they [[03:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13884.02s)]
*  come out today on inauguration day to make their voices heard and to support immigrants whether [[03:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13888.18s)]
*  they're documented or undocumented okay Karl Nesbitt there in Chicago thank you for that I [[03:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13892.5s)]
*  just want to get a final quick thought at this point from our panelists Steve first Stephanie [[03:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13898.82s)]
*  on that notion of immigration and we don't know exactly what's going to come in terms of [[03:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13905.7s)]
*  of movements for the rest of the day is that something that you think there is a sense of fear [[03:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13909.86s)]
*  around I I think it depends on who you ask there are certainly a significant number of the American [[03:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13914.5s)]
*  people who want to see reasonable immigration policies implemented and particularly there's [[03:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13922.26s)]
*  broad support for targeting folks who are not only here illegally but are committing crimes [[03:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13930.34s)]
*  I think the sport support begins to erode based on most recent polling by CNN it begins to erode a [[03:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13936.98s)]
*  bit when it comes to taking away birthright citizenship or some of the other things that [[03:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13943.78s)]
*  the Trump administration has proposed what I will note though is just in the final remarks there is [[03:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13949.54s)]
*  that you know the speech took place in the rotunda and one of my favorite carvings in the rotunda is [[03:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13955.220000000001s)]
*  of Cleo she is riding on the chariot of time essentially she's in the car of history and [[03:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13961.94s)]
*  she's standing in this chariot and it's a reminder that history is being recorded as time progresses [[03:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13969.86s)]
*  and I think that that is true in this case with this presidency today's day one but history will [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13976.26s)]
*  be watching and recording what this administration actually succeeds beyond what the rhetoric that [[03:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13983.7s)]
*  they issued today and Rodney just a quick thought from yourself as well what's your high point at [[03:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13990.02s)]
*  this part of the day so far you know it has been a privilege to be able to serve in congress just [[03:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=13998.02s)]
*  like stef and and she's right there's so much history in a place like the capital rotunda a [[03:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14004.74s)]
*  statuary hall where the lunch is happening today I've never I've never actually had it smell so [[03:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14010.02s)]
*  good it was so floral when I was walking through there today but one thing that matters in life [[03:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14016.26s)]
*  and in that historical record are results and Donald Trump had results in reducing illegal [[03:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14022.98s)]
*  immigration and when you want to look at the results Donald Trump talks about what he what [[03:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14029.7s)]
*  he wants to do to reduce what America has witnessed over the last four years at our [[03:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14035.300000000001s)]
*  southern border and he's already seen some of those results if you are a convicted criminal [[03:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14040.34s)]
*  who has entered this country illegally yes you should be scared that you're going to be you're [[03:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14047.460000000001s)]
*  going to be sought after and sent back to where to the country of your origin that is something [[03:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14053.22s)]
*  that Donald Trump promised to do and frankly a good number of Americans across all demographics [[03:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14059.699999999999s)]
*  across all races everywhere in this country said he wanted them to do these are the issues that he [[03:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14064.98s)]
*  promised to address and when you go through this initial steps of his presidency when you start to [[03:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14071.38s)]
*  look at executive orders we can begin to to go through each and every one of those line by line [[03:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14077.62s)]
*  but in the end you have to take it through a prism of what do his supporters who sent him [[03:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14083.94s)]
*  back to the White House want the most and he is going to try to address it it was in his speech [[03:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14088.980000000001s)]
*  today it was in a speech to his supporters afterwards just a different way of saying it [[03:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14093.7s)]
*  in a different tone and it will be in the many speeches for the rest of tonight [[03:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14098.58s)]
*  And indeed we are expecting him to sign some of the documents relating to some of those actions [[03:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14103.06s)]

*  well a number of things one we're we wish we could have done it outside like we traditionally [[04:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14593.619999999999s)]
*  have done it and we've had thousands of people who are here in Washington to be able to watch [[04:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14599.38s)]
*  the inauguration including a number of people from Tennessee and from my district but they [[04:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14605.78s)]
*  understood and the main thing is even though they were here they wanted to be part of the swearing [[04:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14612.18s)]
*  in and part of the inauguration they understand that today is a historic day and they were here to [[04:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14618.02s)]
*  support President Trump in his agenda and so as I was their representative there in the rotunda [[04:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14623.94s)]
*  listening to the the speech I thought President Trump hit on every single issue that he talked [[04:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14631.86s)]
*  about during the during this campaign for his election talked about what he's going to do to [[04:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14639.14s)]
*  make this country better specifically as it relates to the issues of energy and security [[04:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14645.06s)]
*  in our specifically at our southern border and the economy and inflation and that's what [[04:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14653.699999999999s)]
*  that's what the people elected him to do in my district and in Tennessee and across the nation [[04:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14660.5s)]
*  And during that inaugural address congressman at times it felt like a state of the union address [[04:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14666.42s)]
*  in that the Republican members were standing up and cheering and the Democratic members [[04:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14673.300000000001s)]
*  were not and President Trump as he said there outlined a number of quite detailed policies [[04:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14678.1s)]
*  and plans that he had for the presidency when often we hear more grand ideas and bigger visions [[04:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14683.7s)]
*  without that level of detail what is he going to do to try and bring those two sides of America [[04:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14690.18s)]
*  together and unify this country? Well I was actually impressed and certainly glad that [[04:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14696.42s)]
*  President Trump not only won the electoral vote but also won the the popular vote and he comes in [[04:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14702.74s)]
*  he comes in at a higher rating than that he had maybe during the course of his presidency and to [[04:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14709.94s)]
*  me that tells me that the American people are behind him behind his initiatives behind behind [[04:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14714.98s)]
*  his policies but I think that President Trump will reach out and try to see where we can find [[04:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14722.18s)]
*  common ground I mean every single American whether you're Republican Democrat red blue what have you [[04:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14730.02s)]
*  you want a strong economy during his four years in the White House people had more money in their [[04:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14738.02s)]
*  pockets they talked about that a lot and that was a central issue during his campaign and why I think [[04:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14744.02s)]
*  somebody non-traditional Republicans voted for him in this election we're all concerned about [[04:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14750.02s)]
*  about energy and the availability of energy and the cost of energy and let's work together to [[04:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14756.98s)]
*  to make it where again the United States is a is a net exporter and we produce more energy here in [[04:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14764.34s)]
*  the United States than we export and and lastly on the on the border which during his first term [[04:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14771.46s)]
*  was seen as being a partisan issue Republicans supporting strength at the southern border and [[04:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14780.339999999998s)]
*  and Democrats not we've seen we've seen Democrats certainly in legislation that we've just voted on [[04:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14788.099999999999s)]
*  in the last week or so in the Lake and Riley Act support the idea of export certainly turning people [[04:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14795.94s)]
*  away who have committed violent crimes on Americans so we can find we can find common ground those are [[04:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14804.66s)]
*  probably the three most predominant issues facing the United States at this time and it's something [[04:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14814.02s)]
*  the Republicans and Democrats should seek to find common solutions. [[04:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14820.66s)]
*  And indeed President Trump will need the assistance of the both houses of Congress to achieve some of [[04:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14826.9s)]
*  what he's described he will need legislation not just executive actions and on that issue of [[04:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14832.58s)]
*  immigration I mean successive Congresses have failed to pass legislation on that although there is [[04:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14838.1s)]
*  people say unanimous support for reform of the whole immigration system to allow more legal [[04:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14844.66s)]
*  pathways for people to come to the U.S. as well from what you're saying there do you think there [[04:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14850.26s)]
*  is a realistic chance of both parties working across the aisle to bring in legislation like that? [[04:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14855.7s)]
*  Well President Trump has talked a lot about our our broken immigration system and in fact he's [[04:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14862.34s)]
*  talked about how his wife came into the to the United States and as a congressman [[04:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14868.34s)]
*  we work with people all the time to try to help get either visas or status and help them work [[04:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14875.14s)]
*  through the work through the system there's a right way to come into this country there's a [[04:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14883.78s)]
*  wrong way to come into this country and in the end we're a nation of immigrants that's how we [[04:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14888.98s)]
*  were built that's how we continue to that's how we continue to grow and thrive but let's have [[04:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14894.1s)]
*  people come through the right way and and to your question obviously there are a lot of hurdles and [[04:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14900.26s)]
*  I think that President Trump will look at trying to streamline the process while also working [[04:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14908.34s)]
*  to make sure that our borders are secure and finishing the wall and giving our border control [[04:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14915.380000000001s)]
*  agents who patrol not only the southern border but the northern border and all the borders of the [[04:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14921.94s)]
*  nation the tools and the resources that they can that they need in order to do their jobs. [[04:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14928.1s)]
*  One of the big challenges facing the new congress now the new president is going to be passing a [[04:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14936.5s)]
*  budget the government has funded until just the middle of March are you going to get that deal [[04:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14941.62s)]
*  done or is there going to be a requirement to push it further again? But we need to get we need to [[04:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14947.140000000001s)]

*  I think Republicans are going to be unified behind Donald Trump and in his initiatives and [[04:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14968.98s)]
*  the worst thing in the world would be to have a to have a government funding [[04:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14976.66s)]
*  fight in March so let's work on making sure that the government is funded let's work on the [[04:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14980.02s)]

*  2017 where most of those provisions expire at the end of the year if we don't do anything to make [[04:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=14993.460000000001s)]

*  President Trump was to send that signal that I'm here I'm an elected member of Congress I am from [[04:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15049.06s)]

*  but sadly I don't think that Mr. Trump set us up for that kind of optimism I wish we could. [[04:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15062.259999999998s)]
*  I have just recently been named to the Appropriations Committee so I know you [[04:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15068.82s)]
*  were just talking about budgeting and absolutely right we have to make sure for the American people [[04:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15072.179999999998s)]
*  that we put forward a budget instead of continuing resolution after continuing resolution only to [[04:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15078.58s)]
*  have it blown up by a political fight so I'm hopeful that's why I attended today I wanted I [[04:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15084.34s)]
*  thought it was historic this inauguration of President Trump I wanted to signal that I am here [[04:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15091.86s)]
*  to work and I'm hopeful but there's an awful lot of uncertainty and sadly there was an awfully long [[04:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15097.460000000001s)]
*  list of grievance complaint and darkness. [[04:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15105.14s)]
*  And let's look at President Trump's inaugural address Congresswoman he set out some quite [[04:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15112.5s)]
*  specific policy areas that he wants to address during his term in office what was your reaction [[04:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15117.46s)]
*  to what you heard? Well I will tell you that I'm a crazy note taker so as I sat in the rotunda I [[04:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15123.22s)]
*  took notes I wanted to see the structure of this inaugural address so that it would show me his [[04:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15133.06s)]
*  vision for the future and sadly I found that he opened with a number of untrue statements about [[04:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15138.18s)]
*  the state of America he painted a picture of America as almost a hellscape it is not and the [[04:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15146.34s)]
*  past administration and multiple administrations have tried their very hardest to deal with [[04:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15152.18s)]
*  extraordinary challenges so with the Biden administration sitting there Mr. Trump offered [[04:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15157.78s)]
*  no grace didn't offer any kind of coherent connection from one administration historic [[04:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15165.140000000001s)]
*  administration to his own and so I didn't believe the premise of the beginning of that which Mr. [[04:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15171.300000000001s)]
*  Trump talked about and he returned to that same grievance and dark picture of America in between [[04:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15179.94s)]
*  I think some of the things that he talked about is immigration certainly we all want to deal with [[04:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15187.78s)]
*  immigration I'm worried about who will get hurt in the meantime innocent folks who will get hurt [[04:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15193.380000000001s)]
*  in the meantime he talked about autos he talked about tariffs again not saying the truth about [[04:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15199.7s)]
*  tariffs the tariffs are not attacks on China or other foreign countries tariffs are attacks on [[04:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15205.86s)]
*  Americans which will be inflationary and Mr. Trump knows that even as he claims tariffs are the right [[04:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15212.18s)]
*  way to go he talked about free speech we are a country that enjoys and protects free speech [[04:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15219.14s)]
*  that's not something he will deliver to us he talked about justice under the law man oh man [[04:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15225.86s)]
*  what I want is equal justice under the law no man should be separate from that no man should be [[04:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15232.42s)]
*  above the law and yet look what his supreme court did and so it was a speech of contradiction [[04:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15238.58s)]
*  and to me that was sad an opportunity lost he was re-elected it's very very clear we had a [[04:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15245.62s)]
*  peaceful transfer of power something we were denied four years ago in that very place so it [[04:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15252.26s)]
*  was a speech of contradictions I'll be here to work across the aisle whether we're budgeting or [[04:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15259.62s)]
*  we're trying to fix our immigration system or we're trying to make sure we educate our children [[04:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15266.1s)]
*  to the very best extent or we try to make sure we bring equal justice under the law to all Americans [[04:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15271.220000000001s)]
*  and congresswoman I want to ask you because you are obviously from the great state of Pennsylvania [[04:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15280.74s)]
*  when president Trump was talking about the need to declare a national energy emergency drill baby [[04:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15285.54s)]
*  drill he said his famous phrase catchphrase of course that he repeats often is that something [[04:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15291.46s)]
*  that will actually strike a chord with many people in your own state that they do want to see some [[04:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15298.5s)]
*  environmental regulations rolled back and perhaps they're the people who voted for president trump [[04:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15304.419999999998s)]
*  oh I'm certain there are Pennsylvania is rich in natural resources and natural gas and other [[04:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15310.5s)]
*  resources and mr trump was the winner of pennsylvania and so I'm sure that will appeal [[04:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15317.54s)]
*  to some people but I would ask that anybody who's thinking about that we can do both things at the [[04:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15326.26s)]
*  same time we can access our natural resources while protecting our environment after all this [[04:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15332.26s)]
*  is America we can do both and so I would be very sad to see a rollback of environmental protections [[04:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15338.740000000002s)]
*  I do want people to be able to move forward I think the folks out in California we need to pull [[04:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15345.54s)]
*  down some regulations that are simply redundant and tangling of people trying to move forward [[04:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15351.7s)]
*  but we can do both it is not one versus the other drill and destroy our environment [[04:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15358.1s)]
*  versus protect our environment and not drill we can do both we're America [[04:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15364.42s)]
*  okay congresswoman madeleine dean democratic congresswoman from pennsylvania thanks as always [[04:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15369.539999999999s)]
*  for being with us here on bbc news I want to go back to our panelists now the hostages are beginning [[04:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15374.02s)]
*  to come home and indeed president trump mentioned that in his speech as well congresswoman thank you [[04:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15380.02s)]
*  for being with us I want to go back to our panel as I was saying and bring in margaret talev there [[04:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15388.98s)]
*  Margaret listening to the two congresspeople from different sides of the aisle but both saying that [[04:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15394.5s)]
*  they do want to make an effort to work together on some of those key things of concern to the [[04:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15401.14s)]
*  american people and of course just the slimmest majority in the house for the republican party [[04:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15407.46s)]
*  we heard president trump even joking about how slim it was and how he'd made it even slimmer by [[04:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15412.82s)]
*  nominating some congresspeople to his cabinet that's true he certainly did do that and it's [[04:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15417.62s)]
*  going to be a little bit of time until the special elections to fill those roles I think there are a [[04:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15423.38s)]
*  couple of interesting dynamics to watch and one is is either party really incentivized to make deals [[04:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15428.82s)]
*  and the other is is president trump the newly inaugurated trump 2.0 going to try to leave a [[04:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15434.9s)]
*  lot to congress or is he going to seek to either expand his use of executive power or just go for [[04:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15441.3s)]
*  it and see if anyone will stop him and so I think although he has been speaking to republicans in [[04:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15448.74s)]
*  congress saying it's really important that they work together in a unified front there are also [[04:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15454.98s)]
*  some early signs that he is seeking to take more and more decision making out of the hands of [[04:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15459.78s)]
*  congress entirely and when you do things like declare an emergency at the border part of what [[04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15463.86s)]
*  you're setting up is the ability to do things like utilize the military or redirect spending [[04:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15470.82s)]
*  without having to run it through congress so with those bare bare majorities there are some areas [[04:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15475.619999999999s)]
*  where I think he is going to need both to unify his own party and to try to get some bipartisan [[04:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15481.859999999999s)]
*  buy-in and those are things like his plan to cut tack his tax cut plans which we didn't actually [[04:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15490.1s)]
*  hear that much about yet in these initial remarks or issues around raising the debt ceiling [[04:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15496.9s)]
*  there are some things that a president can't just unilaterally decide to do themselves but [[04:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15504.9s)]
*  in other areas I do think we will see him test the legal limits and the political will [[04:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15509.22s)]
*  to stop him from just making some moves while while keeping congress at arm's length and trying [[04:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15517.3s)]
*  to diminish the congress's role and as we were just discussing looming front and center of all [[04:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15524.1s)]
*  of that is the need to fund the federal government to agree a permanent budget here not just another [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15531.380000000001s)]
*  continuing resolution as has been the case in recent months and years and when you speak to [[04:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15536.9s)]
*  republican and democrats here they do all want to get a more permanent situation but they don't have [[04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15543.140000000001s)]
*  a lot of road they've got to get that done really in the next few weeks margaret don't they how do [[04:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15548.66s)]
*  you think we'll see president trump get involved or will we in that so we've seen this and it's [[04:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15552.74s)]
*  played out a little bit in public not just behind the scenes the sort of dual track machinations [[04:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15558.74s)]
*  about whether it makes sense to pull a bunch of difficult things together to use the levers [[04:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15563.22s)]
*  against one another or to move in two separate trenches i think president trump has a few [[04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15570.1s)]
*  different equities to reconcile and one is how the house operates versus how the senate operates not [[04:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15576.02s)]
*  to go super inside baseball for a bbc audience but you know the house of representatives and the [[04:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15581.46s)]
*  u.s senate both controlled by republicans but really different republicans with different [[04:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15588.019999999999s)]
*  world views and different senses about how much they should sort of you know bow to president [[04:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15593.539999999999s)]
*  trump's wishes and and if you get elected in a house district your district may be much more [[04:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15602.179999999998s)]
*  solidly republican if you are a u.s senator and you get elected from many states it's a little [[04:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15608.18s)]
*  bit more of a mixed bag and you really have to think about what you're doing here so he needs [[04:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15613.300000000001s)]
*  to understand those dynamics as well as understand what are the most likely strategies to enable him [[04:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15617.300000000001s)]
*  to do as much as he wants to do without completely running out of string completely running out of [[04:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15624.74s)]
*  thread the the budget the continuing resolution is one of those kind of thresholds one of those [[04:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15630.74s)]
*  time markers and the other is when the u.s runs out of money i mean that's the most important one [[04:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15637.46s)]
*  you can patch a continuing resolution and keep funding the government but at a certain point [[04:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15643.38s)]
*  when the treasury decides that all the extraordinary measures have been pulled and that there's not [[04:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15648.82s)]
*  enough money coming in to cover the debt that's when you actually need unity across your own party [[04:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15653.939999999999s)]
*  and probably some bipartisan buy-in [[04:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15661.06s)]
*  okay margaret we'll come back to that in a moment because i want to get james rose bush's [[04:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15666.26s)]

*  happened here so far today what do you make of what you've seen it's quite a different start to [[04:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15772.42s)]
*  the first trump administration yeah i think it's um it was a much more focused and disciplined [[04:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15778.02s)]
*  donald trump than the first time around i didn't think the speech was anywhere near as dark [[04:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15784.9s)]
*  as his first inauguration speech i thought it was a lot more optimistic he certainly presented a [[04:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15789.62s)]
*  picture to americans that he would deliver what he promised them in the election campaign he was [[04:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15795.38s)]
*  very clear about that reminded them what he promised and said i will deliver this and there'll [[04:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15801.14s)]
*  be a new golden age to it but he also i think showed a human side to it which is that he did [[04:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15806.019999999999s)]
*  survive his assassination attempt just a few months ago and then nearly got shot again a few [[04:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15812.66s)]
*  weeks later that's going to change anybody and i've certainly detected with trump when i've spoken [[04:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15818.019999999999s)]
*  to him privately when i watched him again today when i've seen him at the rallies recently he's [[04:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15822.66s)]
*  a slightly changed guy he's somebody who genuinely believes that he should be dead he isn't dead he [[04:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15827.06s)]
*  survived miraculously by half an inch an assassin's bullet and he's determined to make the most of his [[04:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15833.539999999999s)]
*  life and indeed his second chance at the presidency so i felt that for a number of reasons if i'm an [[04:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15838.98s)]
*  american and i voted for him he gave me the speech i wanted to hear and the big question now is can [[04:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15844.34s)]
*  he deliver on those promises and he did say piers at one point and my legacy will be that of a [[04:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15850.42s)]
*  peacemaker and unifier but then he went on to deliver these unscripted remarks in the second [[04:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15858.18s)]
*  gathering in the overflow room when he did air a number of those grievances that we're familiar [[04:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15863.94s)]
*  with hearing from him in rally so how do you see that he is going to try and set out to be this [[04:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15869.3s)]
*  great unifier of the american people well i think there's no doubt that the election results showed [[04:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15874.98s)]
*  a lot more americans gravitated to trump this time around than in the previous two elections and they [[04:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15880.98s)]
*  came from all cross sections of american society black white jew muslim rich poor it was extraordinary [[04:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15885.859999999999s)]
*  and i think he was taken aback i spoke to him the morning after he won literally a few hours later [[04:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15893.46s)]
*  and he couldn't believe the scale of the victory he won everything you know he won the white house [[04:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15898.02s)]
*  he won the house of representatives he won the senate he won the popular vote electoral college [[04:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15901.62s)]
*  he won everything so i think he realizes that he's got an amazing opportunity of almost total power [[04:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15906.1s)]
*  as president certainly for the first two years to really implement what he wants to do so i think [[04:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15911.94s)]
*  that for that reason i think that there is optimism in america that coupled with the fact he has some [[04:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15917.62s)]
*  pretty smart people around him like elon musk that things can actually get done here which has often [[04:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15923.460000000001s)]
*  been the criticism of america in recent years where simply there isn't enough time for any [[04:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15928.5s)]
*  president to really be that effective so i think it'll be very interesting to see with people like [[04:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15932.98s)]
*  musk next to him whether he can achieve those things okay at this point pieris i just want to [[04:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15937.14s)]

*  inauguration obviously was indoors we heard president trump reference a few times how cold [[04:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15980.18s)]
*  it is i've been standing out here since six o'clock this morning i can concur with him that [[04:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15984.82s)]
*  it is cold out here but do you think it's kind of changed do you think it's kind of changed the [[04:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15988.9s)]
*  the dynamic and the pace and the remarks seemed to be kind of more intimate than perhaps they [[04:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=15994.58s)]
*  would have been if he had been making them outdoors yeah i think inevitably i don't think it's what he [[04:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16000.1s)]
*  would have wanted there's something extraordinary about being outside on the inauguration day and [[04:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16005.539999999999s)]
*  the fact that they were sitting there and they were sitting there and they were sitting there [[04:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16040.42s)]
*  and they were sitting there and they were sitting there and they were sitting there and they were [[04:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16044.02s)]

*  even his most begrudging opponents and enemies would have to admit that and he now has i think [[04:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16068.1s)]
*  both personally after the assassination attempt and professionally with this uh with this new win [[04:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16074.66s)]
*  he's got a second chance both at life and at being president and again from the conversations i've [[04:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16080.42s)]
*  had with him i do detect a slightly changed man he's not going to change in terms of his rhetoric [[04:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16086.18s)]
*  he won't change if someone trashes him he'll trash them back that is donald trump you know when he [[04:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16090.9s)]
*  gets nearly 80 you're not going to suddenly change all your spots but i do think he feels [[04:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16095.38s)]
*  the hand of history and i do think he knows that if he can deliver on the key issues of that election [[04:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16099.539999999999s)]
*  which ultimately were illegal immigration and the obvious crisis on the southern border in america [[04:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16105.3s)]
*  on the cost of living crisis getting this raging issue of inflation back to a place where there's [[04:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16111.14s)]
*  prosperity again in the united states and thirdly this big thing of common sense as he calls it the [[04:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16116.019999999999s)]
*  core of common sense the common sense revolution which he would say involves the the dei movement [[04:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16121.94s)]
*  diversity equity inclusion the wokeism the woke mind virus as elon musk calls it the the gender [[04:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16128.9s)]
*  issues the identity politics issues if all that can be just thrown away and we get back to a broad [[04:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16135.62s)]
*  spectrum of agreed common sense then i think not only will america benefit from that but i think [[04:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16143.140000000001s)]
*  countries like ours in the uk will also benefit from just abandoning what has been often something [[04:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16148.74s)]
*  completely at odds with how most people are thinking okay well we'll wait to see just what [[04:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16155.22s)]

*  regard it as this is america's day and that they will not judge a second trump administration by [[04:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16223.94s)]
*  what he says but by what he does and certainly as you did as you mentioned he alluded to the [[04:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16232.58s)]
*  gaza ceasefire deal and of course that is a deal whereby all accounts he his threats his pressure [[04:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16239.94s)]
*  actually made a difference will you remember his his warning to hamas that they would have held to [[04:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16246.58s)]

*  first visit in the second term and interestingly enough the riad summit was all about arab leaders [[04:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16288.42s)]
*  urging president trump to confront iran this time around they don't want a confrontation the region [[04:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16293.7s)]
*  has changed since the first term of president trump there's been a a sort of rapprochement between [[04:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16300.74s)]
*  iran and the arab states and so president trump is going to have to try to find his way through this [[04:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16308.66s)]
*  but of course in a place like saudi arabia there's very close personal ties with the de facto ruler [[04:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16314.9s)]

*  a very fragile state everyone looking to the possibility of getting the negotiations [[04:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16344.42s)]
*  started and moving to the second phase which of course will all fall now to president trump and [[04:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16349.3s)]
*  his administration to oversee the implementation of that what is the sense of what their approach [[04:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16354.1s)]
*  will be and whether it will be different to that of the biden administration [[04:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16360.1s)]
*  i think we have to say one thing for certain that their approach was different to the biden [[04:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16366.98s)]
*  administration the ceasefire agreement that we saw come into force yesterday was effectively the [[04:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16371.46s)]
*  same document that had been circulating since the summer of last year had effectively been drafted [[04:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16377.3s)]
*  by the biden administration why was it agreed last week well it was because president trump had made [[04:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16384.34s)]
*  such an ambition of his to have this deal done before he took office today he'd already sent [[04:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16390.34s)]
*  steve witkoff to the negotiations in qatar alongside joe biden's envoy to push talks through from all [[04:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16397.620000000003s)]

*  netanyahu in the run-up to this agreement making it very clear to him how badly and how important [[04:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16411.86s)]
*  president trump viewed getting a deal done so i don't think there's any doubt the role that [[04:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16418.34s)]
*  president trump's words played in getting this process to the point it is now we are as you said [[04:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16424.74s)]
*  in the and the second day of this ceasefire agreement so far most of it appears to be going [[04:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16429.780000000002s)]
*  according to plan it will continue in phases there are many things that could go wrong so many moving [[04:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16435.620000000003s)]
*  parts in terms of releases of hostages releases of palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal [[04:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16441.22s)]
*  of israeli forces from some parts of the gaza strip so the process will no doubt be tested over [[04:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16447.7s)]
*  the next six weeks that's the the the the length of this temporary ceasefire and yes i think the [[04:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16454.74s)]
*  real crunch will come when they have to start talking about phase two that's when all the [[04:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16461.06s)]
*  difficult issues related to gaza so we're talking about things like is it a permanent ceasefire what [[04:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16465.86s)]
*  role will hamas play in any future government israel of course doesn't want it to be involved [[04:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16472.100000000002s)]
*  at all but if it's not hamas who's it going to be and there is a group of other hostages who are [[04:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16477.06s)]
*  not part of this first phase so the question will really be does the trump administration regard this [[04:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16482.9s)]
*  as being job done for now the the attacks the the fighting in gaza has stopped some of the hostage [[04:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16488.42s)]
*  is are coming back or will they continue with that engagement to push through what will be the much [[04:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16495.7s)]
*  harder discussions and harder compromises which will have to be made if phase two is actually [[04:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16502.02s)]
*  going to happen and jona we remember just a couple of days after those october 7th attacks that [[04:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16507.46s)]
*  president biden traveled to israel and that famous embrace of prime minister benjamin netanyahu given [[04:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16514.420000000002s)]

*  privately there's much discussion about his desire to win the nobel peace prize do you think we might [[04:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16525.78s)]
*  see a visit from president trump to jerusalem anytime soon is that something that the prime minister [[04:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16531.940000000002s)]
*  there would welcome well i think he would certainly welcome it i i haven't heard of any plans of it [[04:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16538.18s)]
*  taking place just yet but it is quite revealing what we've had in terms of the statement from [[04:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16546.98s)]
*  prime minister netanyahu welcoming the inauguration of president trump just let me read a small part [[04:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16553.22s)]
*  of it to you he says i look forward to working with you to return the hostages to destroy [[04:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16558.34s)]
*  hamas's military capabilities in gaza and to ensure gaza never again poses a threat to israel [[04:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16563.379999999997s)]
*  there was no mention in this statement in this welcoming letter from president from prime minister [[04:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16569.3s)]
*  netanyahu no talk of peace or securing peace it was a language of war and that really gives you [[04:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16575.94s)]
*  an indication of the ways prime minister netanyahu may be thinking and also the way [[04:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16582.26s)]
*  he's thinking in relation to his own government because prime minister netanyahu's administration [[04:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16587.78s)]
*  has really been stretched almost a breaking point by this ceasefire agreement there are members of [[04:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16592.179999999997s)]
*  it who would like to go back to war and i think you can see there in the messaging there that [[04:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16596.42s)]
*  that prime minister netanyahu is has really feels that he's pushed things almost to the limit in [[04:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16601.3s)]
*  place and the language is very much not of consolidating that peace but of being ready to [[04:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16606.5s)]
*  go back to war indeed fragile and tentative times ahead jonah fisher in jerusalem and lise ducette [[04:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16612.98s)]

*  cities are referred to here in this press release and there was reporting coming into today that [[04:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16726.579999999998s)]

*  do not cooperate with ice authorities with the ice agency that they might be facing a massive [[04:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16738.58s)]
*  deportation crackdown as well and so one of those cities of chicago we're going to speak now to the [[04:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16744.74s)]

*  fact that donald trump has set cracking down on immigration particularly in cities what in in his [[04:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16760.74s)]
*  press release says criminal sanctuaries particularly that being a priority well look every [[04:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16766.34s)]
*  administration that comes in wants to set its priorities and make a mark to set the tone [[04:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16773.46s)]
*  unfortunately what we're hearing from this administration is a tone of division it's a tone [[04:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16778.5s)]
*  of hate and frankly a tone of illegal conduct if they were to do the things that they had predicted [[04:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16785.7s)]
*  to do regarding cracking down and mass deportations they would be violating the rights of people who [[04:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16792.74s)]
*  lawfully have to be here and to be clear no one's providing sanctuary for violent criminals people [[04:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16799.38s)]
*  that are terrorizing neighborhoods that's why we have the criminal justice system and those people [[04:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16805.620000000003s)]
*  are found they are prosecuted and they're held accountable but just willy-nilly going into [[04:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16811.940000000002s)]
*  neighborhoods into businesses and taking people for what they look like without having probable [[04:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16817.7s)]
*  cause that's unconstitutional and it's not something that any city let alone a city like chicago should [[04:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16824.26s)]
*  tolerate or stand for okay so mayor the incoming well now borders are in the trump administration [[04:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16830.98s)]
*  tom holman says that's not at all what he deems these operations to be he calls them targeted [[04:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16838.1s)]
*  operations and specifically that the administration is looking to round up those who have criminal [[04:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16843.22s)]
*  convictions and those who have entered the country illegally and that these are meant to be targeted [[04:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16849.7s)]
*  not broad widespread raids in a city like chicago do you think that can work in chicago [[04:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16854.9s)]
*  he said something very very different not that long ago and there's legal ways in which that [[04:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16862.100000000002s)]
*  can happen but the rattling the saber of mass deportations which is language that he has used [[04:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16868.18s)]
*  even a few months ago here in chicago when he was crowing at a republican fundraiser about what he [[04:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16875.38s)]
*  intended to do to disrupt our city and arrest elected officials who stood for our our position [[04:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16881.7s)]
*  as a sanctuary city that's something very very different than legally carrying out targeted [[04:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16890.02s)]
*  arrest and deportation of people who have been convicted of violent crime i don't think anybody [[04:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16895.86s)]
*  is going to disagree with doing this legally for people who have already been a judge as being here [[04:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16901.78s)]
*  illegally having committed crime but that's not what he has talked about and that's certainly not [[04:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16907.86s)]
*  what president trump has talked about they're talking about something radically different [[04:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16912.98s)]
*  that is intended to embarrass and disrupt cities like chicago mayor just to understand and i know [[04:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16916.9s)]
*  you're of course no longer the mayor of chicago but if these were to be these targeted operations [[04:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16924.26s)]
*  as they were described by the borders are to round up those who have been convicted of crimes [[04:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16929.46s)]
*  would chicago try to stand in the way of that look i think you should be deeply skeptical as somebody [[04:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16936.26s)]
*  who has radically changed their language over the last couple days the fact of the matter is i think [[04:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16943.219999999998s)]
*  the so-called borders are the reality is hitting him the ice agents and other agents in my federal [[04:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16948.579999999998s)]
*  agents that might assist in this effort they're not very big in number they can only pull this off [[04:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16956.5s)]
*  if they have the cooperation and complicity of local law enforcement that is not possible in [[04:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16962.739999999998s)]
*  chicago or the state of illinois because we have passed laws to guard against the federal government [[04:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16968.98s)]
*  coming in and doing exactly what these folks have talked about which is mass deportation i don't [[04:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16974.74s)]
*  accept what he's saying now because his rhetoric for months has been radically different again there [[04:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16981.06s)]
*  are legal ways in which one can do this there are legal ways in which they can work with the local [[04:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16988.18s)]
*  courts to identify people in place a detainer on them and then have them to be deported so mayor if [[04:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=16993.86s)]
*  i could just jump in there if i could just jump in there and i understand your point there you [[04:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17000.5s)]
*  know looking at the broader picture here you said that this was an extremely divisive [[04:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17006.5s)]
*  inaugural speech and that the president has been divisive at the same time if you look at polling [[04:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17011.7s)]
*  the majority of americans saw immigration as a massive problem and saw the what they what donald [[04:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17017.7s)]
*  trump calls a crisis at the southern border as an issue that needs to be addressed well we can't [[04:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17024.18s)]
*  surrender our rights as americans and in a democracy based upon a snapshot in time reflected [[04:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17030.26s)]
*  in a poll there's a lot of things that would show up in polls but if we agreed with them and set [[04:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17037.62s)]
*  policy on the basis of those things that would mean we'd be violating who we are as a country [[04:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17043.379999999997s)]
*  the precepts of our constitution that can't be the deciding factor what we have to do is abide by [[04:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17048.98s)]
*  the rule of law as a lawyer i understand that as a former federal prosecutor i know that [[04:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17056.74s)]
*  but we've got to abide by the the rule of law and not just give into the prevailing political wins [[04:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17063.14s)]
*  okay mayor really good to get your perspective today thank you so much for joining us on bbc news [[04:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17071.7s)]

*  as we see margaret speaker johnson getting up to say a few words here in honor of donald trump i [[04:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17160.18s)]
*  just want to get your take on what we were hearing from the former mayor of chicago lori lightfoot [[04:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17166.66s)]
*  do you think we're going to see are we going to see a real conflict between you know the blue [[04:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17173.379999999997s)]
*  states and red states these sanctuary cities and this trump administration well we certainly may [[04:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17178.1s)]
*  and the rhetoric so far seems to be ramping up to that moment but again campaign rhetoric and how [[04:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17184.66s)]
*  policies are actually enacted can often be two very different things so when you use language like [[04:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17192.1s)]
*  mass deportations this is language that actually it surprised many democrats in joe biden's world [[04:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17198.18s)]
*  or the democratic party world to learn over the course of the past year that when you ask [[04:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17204.66s)]
*  americans in general would you support mass deportations of undocumented or illegal immigrants [[04:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17209.38s)]
*  it's actually popular across the board about half of democrats like the idea the numbers are [[04:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17215.54s)]
*  slightly larger for independents and much larger for republicans something like nine and ten [[04:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17221.14s)]
*  republicans like the idea but when you get down to the nitty-gritty and axios and ipsos just did [[04:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17225.78s)]
*  some of this polling and we in my institute in syracuse has also done polling on these issues [[04:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17232.02s)]
*  when you start asking americans how would you do it do you support using active military to carry [[04:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17237.54s)]
*  these out do you support using money that was meant for the military to do other things to carry [[04:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17244.98s)]
*  these out do you support separating parents and children in order to move swiftly the support for [[04:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17250.420000000002s)]
*  that plummets and so final trump has two considerations and one is does the federal [[04:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17256.260000000002s)]
*  government want to get into these legal tangles with multiple states at the same time but two [[04:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17264.26s)]
*  and probably more important for a brand new president inaugurated you know two or three hours [[04:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17269.7s)]
*  ago is do you want to immediately go to something that's going to actually be deeply unpopular and [[04:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17274.18s)]
*  and lose the support that you actually have when you keep it at a surface level you can talk about [[04:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17280.82s)]
*  mass deportations and people say because what people what americans who broadly like the sort [[04:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17285.94s)]
*  of vague idea are saying is you know there are there's a strain on resources countries can't [[04:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17292.02s)]
*  really have open borders or you wouldn't be a country if anybody could come in at any time [[04:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17299.86s)]
*  and that there has to be a way to enforce border limits okay that everybody largely agrees on that [[04:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17305.3s)]
*  but the minute you start getting into how the money gets used the impact on individuals and [[04:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17312.100000000002s)]
*  another question what do you do with many many americans who came here or were brought here from [[04:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17318.26s)]
*  other countries as children they had no say in it and the only country they've ever known as the [[04:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17324.98s)]
*  united states the only culture to which they're acclimated is the u.s that's really where they're [[04:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17330.98s)]
*  from where are they going to go back to how would they fend for themselves or aren't they really [[04:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17335.46s)]
*  americans these are issues that are deeply deeply divisive in our society and where trump would [[04:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17340.019999999997s)]
*  really lose actually a lot of the center okay certainly an interesting point i want to get [[04:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17345.46s)]
*  a reaction also from james rose bush who's also with us james what do you think about what margaret [[04:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17352.18s)]
*  just said i think she makes an excellent point i think the term mass deportation it was probably [[04:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17356.5s)]
*  not a great way as a label for what i think they want to do and a lot of americans want to see [[04:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17364.5s)]
*  i think also you see this administration working closely with the countries [[04:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17371.62s)]
*  that had these original migrants leave from so it's not not a question i don't see the possibility [[04:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17375.86s)]
*  of rounding up people in trucks or plane we've had them moved on airplanes and so forth before [[04:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17384.42s)]
*  but it has to be handled diplomatically with those countries where they're being sent to i think in [[04:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17391.059999999998s)]
*  the case of mexico that's also underway and i think that the some of you you saw and going back [[04:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17396.34s)]
*  to thinking about the presentation that the president made today in his speech it was perhaps [[04:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17402.98s)]
*  most important that to him that he had time with a very large audience across the world to explain [[04:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17408.5s)]
*  exactly what he wants to do and to achieve at one place so probably there there are you know there [[04:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17419.14s)]
*  are other speeches that presidents make but there isn't as much time devoted to it and as large an [[04:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17426.98s)]
*  audience as a president makes at his inauguration and i think that that is probably one of the goals [[04:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17432.18s)]
*  that was undertaken here to say most definitely most broadly and most dramatically as fast as they [[04:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17440.74s)]
*  possibly could this is what is going to happen now as you pointed out earlier assuming the process [[04:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17447.38s)]
*  of actually doing this it could take much longer you have different parts of our constitutional [[04:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17453.940000000002s)]
*  government you saw in the case for example of where president biden tried to reduce or rid [[04:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17461.780000000002s)]
*  rid the world of student loans well that that is not within presidential jurisdiction [[04:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17469.3s)]
*  okay so the president doesn't spend money that is handled by the congress so all of these things [[04:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17476.98s)]
*  come under and i think that's the great thing about our form of government that there are checks and [[04:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17483.38s)]
*  balances and also you talked earlier about will this president have a good relationship with a [[04:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17488.579999999998s)]
*  narrow majority of republicans on both sides and i think that is something that reagan had to deal [[04:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17494.26s)]
*  with as you say and reagan knew that in order for him to get past what he wanted to have done in the [[04:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17500.42s)]
*  congress he had to make alliances and he also had to make compromises and one of the things i just [[04:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17508.34s)]
*  want to add i think is extremely extremely important and that is every single year in the [[04:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17514.179999999997s)]
*  budget that was presented by omb and the executive in the executive office they we asked for a [[04:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17520.18s)]
*  balanced budget and the president made an appeal to the american people and said if you're you're [[04:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17527.14s)]
*  living from year to year or day to day in your household you have to have a balanced budget and [[04:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17532.1s)]
*  there's no reason why we can't have in this country a balanced budget and that is what is [[04:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17538.66s)]
*  the president presents a balanced budget to the congress and then they have to sustain that and [[04:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17546.5s)]
*  find the means to sustain it and this is something that i think is absolutely critical and i think [[04:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17552.26s)]
*  that it's it's this sort of interaction between all the different forces and segments of our [[04:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17557.54s)]
*  democratic form of government that is very important the president has stated precisely [[04:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17565.94s)]
*  he wants to achieve now he has to go out and actually perform it he actually has to get it [[04:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17571.78s)]
*  done and so that's why i think it was critical that he put forward in a very forceful clear [[04:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17578.34s)]
*  dramatic really way to the american people exactly what he wanted to do because he was responding [[04:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17584.5s)]
*  follow this he was responding to what a lot of people were telling him at very high level of [[04:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17591.219999999998s)]
*  of lots and lots of people were telling him the numbers were very high this is what we want to [[04:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17599.06s)]
*  have done in this country and this is what needs to take place so he had a majority [[04:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17605.7s)]
*  a vast majority of people behind each one of those points today so that was the power of what he did [[04:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17610.420000000002s)]
*  and i think that probably we'll see more and more addresses we'll see more and more inaugural [[04:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17618.74s)]
*  addresses perhaps in this style than what we have what we might have going back to perhaps a more [[04:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17625.54s)]
*  passive a little bit more you know thoughtful approach at at at an inaugural address i think [[04:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17632.42s)]
*  today however okay maybe starts a new pattern in how a president makes a pitch on day one to say [[04:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17642.02s)]
*  exactly what he's going to do and he'll be judged by that yeah and so he's going to he's going to [[04:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17649.62s)]
*  stand up against that and that's a really interesting point and that's exactly what [[04:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17654.18s)]
*  donald trump said in his rally on sunday you know why wait a few weeks to start getting the things [[04:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17659.7s)]
*  done that have been told to us that the people want that's why i'm going to issue this raft of [[04:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17665.06s)]
*  executive orders and we're just seeing the president there as you've been speaking margaret [[04:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17670.420000000002s)]

*  we've heard that the diet coke button will be back on at the white house it is indeed something [[04:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=17694.9s)]

*  musk here was here a few moments ago and if you you think a new golden age is an exercise in [[05:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18340.02s)]
*  hyperbole he actually said that trump supporters had saved human civilization by this victory [[05:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18346.820000000003s)]

*  talking about crime and fighting crime and overdoses and drugs and things like that [[05:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18373.7s)]

*  for donald trump this will be the third bite of the cherry of course from the day you've outlined [[05:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18384.74s)]
*  the inaugural itself and then that slightly riffing kind of speech he made to those other people in [[05:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18388.9s)]
*  the capital as well i think we'll get another campaign performance here we had it yesterday [[05:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18397.940000000002s)]

*  signing some of these executive orders on stage in front of these 20 000 people and i'm sure that [[05:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18410.02s)]

*  but gary as you said you know it is pretty unusual let's say unprecedented to see a president [[05:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18430.5s)]
*  go to sign executive orders in front of around 20 000 supporters just tell us a bit more about [[05:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18437.38s)]

*  that they expect to talk about the border about energy about regulation [[05:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18448.26s)]

*  when he was making his speech and the crowd here was watching it the thing that got the biggest [[05:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18460.5s)]
*  cheer was this whole idea as he put it of bringing biological truth back to the federal government [[05:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18464.66s)]
*  and by that he means that he thinks that there is only there are only two genders men and women [[05:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18472.579999999998s)]

*  sort of culture war stuff for the actual sort of supporters who are here we'll see we'll see [[05:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18491.940000000002s)]
*  they're also very keen on the border stuff as you can imagine that's a very popular message and maybe [[05:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18498.260000000002s)]
*  something around the cost of living because that is something donald trump has also promised to do [[05:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18504.34s)]
*  but of course bringing down prices controlling prices much easier said than done [[05:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=18509.38s)]

*  This part would usually take place outdoors as part of that presidential parade but obviously [[05:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19152.92s)]
*  given proceedings have been moved indoors. [[05:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19159.039999999997s)]
*  It's happening in Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Hill Visitor Center. [[05:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19161.6s)]

*  He would have moved down Pennsylvania Avenue in his motorcade and then taken his seat in [[05:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19192.92s)]

*  One arena so it is likely that he will let the audience participate in working for them again. [[05:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19477.399999999998s)]
*  And for you and the constituents that you represent in Illinois, what is the number one issue that you want to see him address? [[05:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19487.84s)]
*  Well I think that as those who voted him in and have joined the Republican party being some [[05:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19496.239999999998s)]
*  independents, some Democrats, we're ready to get back to a government that works for the people. [[05:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19502.0s)]
*  Illinois is known for its high taxes, pension debt, over regulation by our government so [[05:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19506.719999999998s)]
*  we're happy to have Republicans from Illinois here in the capital city today and just going to do all we can to support him [[05:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19515.28s)]
*  in his efforts to make the country great as well as all of the 50 states and so I think that [[05:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19523.12s)]
*  when we as Illinoisans can feel that energy and feel that shift back towards common sense governance [[05:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19530.16s)]
*  and regulations, we're ready to stand up to the majority party in Illinois that has been crushing [[05:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19537.44s)]
*  our families and I'll look to deliver on my promises to get back to working for the people. [[05:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19543.2s)]
*  We didn't hear a lot from President Trump in relation to the economy in his inaugural address. [[05:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19551.2s)]
*  He did mention about taxation and tariffs such as it related to foreign countries but do you expect [[05:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19557.600000000002s)]
*  that perhaps he might address that in more detail when he gets to where you are there at the Capitol [[05:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19564.48s)]
*  arena given that it was the issue that so many voters said in November was the driving force to get them to the polls? [[05:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19569.12s)]
*  Yeah I think you're right we did have the incoming Secretary of Commerce speak to both the external [[05:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19577.92s)]
*  revenue service and some of those tariffs agendas and saving more Americans their own hard-earned money. [[05:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19584.32s)]
*  I think that Trump's plan to you know secure the border and stop spending recklessly on those who [[05:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19590.399999999998s)]
*  have entered our country illegally especially in Illinois where they have shown up as a sanctuary [[05:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19597.04s)]
*  state that's looking to save our taxpayers millions of dollars. I think one of his other big [[05:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19601.600000000002s)]
*  priorities is energy independence you know we've done it before and I think he'll look to bring [[05:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19607.920000000002s)]
*  that back again so people can start saving at the pump, saving at the grocery store and feeling like [[05:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19612.8s)]
*  they have the opportunity to keep more of their hard-earned dollars. [[05:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19618.88s)]
*  Indeed he did talk about declaring a national energy emergency during that inaugural address [[05:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19623.68s)]
*  and re-gandeering Illinois state representative thank you so much for joining us here on BBC News [[05:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19629.76s)]
*  as we're speaking we're looking at pictures of President Trump just about to leave the Capitol [[05:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19634.879999999997s)]
*  building so he is soon on his way over to where you and your constituents that you were talking [[05:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19639.92s)]
*  about are waiting for him there in the Capitol One arena and just the [[05:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19645.36s)]
*  final few moments here on Capitol Hill and that inspection of US troops and he will soon be [[05:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19651.68s)]
*  preparing to get into the motorcade to head to the Capitol One arena. [[05:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19658.64s)]
*  Indeed Katrina as we've been looking at these images the military has featured strongly in some [[05:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19665.039999999997s)]
*  of what Donald Trump has talked about in his executive orders and in that rally at the Capitol [[05:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19670.48s)]
*  One arena on Sunday he talked about the need to rid the military of what he called the Capitol One [[05:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19675.2s)]
*  military of what he called woke policies he said it was time to get rid of diversity equity and [[05:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19680.24s)]
*  inclusion policies that he said had ruined the military indeed on the stage there was even a [[05:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19685.920000000002s)]
*  clip plagued of what he believed was showing how the military was once a picture of strength and [[05:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19691.280000000002s)]
*  force and had been undermined by some of these diversity policies but let's bring in again some [[05:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19698.640000000003s)]
*  of our panelists who are joining us. Margaret Tello is still with us a former Republican congressman [[05:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19704.24s)]
*  Jacob Turner is with us and Democrat strategist Joy Cheney is also with us. Congressman I want to [[05:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19709.6s)]
*  start with you and just get your take first of all on what we have seen from Donald Trump this [[05:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19715.28s)]
*  messaging about the golden age of America and this flurry of executive orders. [[05:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19720.879999999997s)]
*  Great to be with you. Listen I think that 77 million Americans that voted for Donald Trump [[05:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19730.559999999998s)]
*  are extremely happy right now. They have been concerned with the direction of this country for [[05:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19738.0s)]
*  the last four years under Joe Biden. They've been worried about the border crimes in their communities [[05:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19743.52s)]
*  the economy inflation and they hear a new message. They see President Trump who very [[05:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19750.8s)]
*  he did not hide his message today he delivered it in a very strong and direct way and so there is a [[05:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19759.44s)]
*  sigh of relief among a huge sector of the country today that there is a new day in America that it [[05:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19765.84s)]
*  can be a golden age and so there's a lot of optimism across the country right now. [[05:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19773.12s)]
*  Joy what's your thought on that obviously as a Democrat strategist a very different day for [[05:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19781.04s)]
*  Democrats as they saw Joe Biden departing the White House. Yeah there's you know a sigh of relief by [[05:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19784.88s)]
*  many Americans there's a sigh of anguish by many Americans. I had I have a friend who has a transgender [[05:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19790.88s)]
*  daughter who you know cried today because their life is going to look very different [[05:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19800.48s)]
*  and there's a lot of fear. There's a lot of fear if you are a person who has family members [[05:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19806.4s)]
*  who may be undocumented and maybe you have been law abiding and you've been doing all the things [[05:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19813.920000000002s)]
*  there's a fear for Black women like me who have like many women not just people of color like many [[05:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19820.88s)]
*  women benefited from equity programs that were seeking to acknowledge us for our merit and to [[05:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19828.32s)]
*  reduce the impacts of racism and misogyny and sexism and ableism and homophobia and what Donald [[05:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19835.120000000003s)]
*  Trump said today is those are good things and we want to bring those things back and that you know [[05:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19842.32s)]
*  at least that's what we heard and so yeah he was strong and he was clear and so a lot of [[05:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19847.84s)]
*  celebration by some a lot of anguish by others but didn't hear a lot about the economy which is [[05:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19854.16s)]
*  interesting. I hope certainly that he's going to address that. As you've been speaking Joy we're [[05:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19859.2s)]
*  just looking at images here of Donald Trump departing the Capitol look he's shaking hands [[05:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19866.48s)]
*  with Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer as he's heading out he's also I think just about to [[05:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19870.88s)]
*  shake hands with the House Minority Leader Democrat Hakeem Jeffries as well congressman from [[05:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19875.76s)]
*  the state of New York and he has been surrounded by congressional leaders at this congressional [[05:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19882.079999999998s)]
*  luncheon and one of his close allies Republican Congressman Steve Scalise as well paying him [[05:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19886.0s)]
*  bidding him farewell here as Donald Trump is getting set and I believe there is John Thune as [[05:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19891.76s)]
*  well Senate Majority Leader this all of course after the congressional luncheon wrapped up in [[05:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19897.039999999997s)]
*  the Capitol and Donald Trump carried out that review of the military that ceremony that we saw [[05:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19902.08s)]
*  in the Capitol and from here as he's holding these conversations with Senator Thune he's about to head [[05:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19907.280000000002s)]
*  in his car you know thousands of people are waiting for him there so those are the images [[05:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19913.52s)]
*  we're looking at right now as Donald Trump is wrapping up this official portion of the day in [[05:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19918.0s)]
*  the Capitol heading over to the arena we just heard that people are waiting there anxiously to [[05:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19921.68s)]
*  see the president. Morgan I just want to get your take on something we heard from Joy there [[05:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19926.960000000003s)]
*  and that we heard also from Ohio Congressman Greg Landsman that they didn't feel that there was much [[05:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19932.160000000003s)]
*  discussed on the economy in Donald Trump's inaugural address do you agree and do you think [[05:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19936.960000000003s)]
*  that there was perhaps more focus on other issues because the economy is going to be particularly [[05:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19941.600000000002s)]
*  bringing down those grocery prices for example one of the challenges? Yeah I mean it's notable [[05:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19946.640000000003s)]
*  I think there are two things if you were paying a lot of attention in the closing weeks of the [[05:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19953.68s)]
*  campaign and then you like took a long winter slumber and woke up today there are two things [[05:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19958.08s)]
*  that you would have expected to hear a lot about that we really didn't hear about in any detail and [[05:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19963.120000000003s)]
*  one is those big beautiful tariffs that we initially thought we were going to see on day [[05:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19968.160000000003s)]
*  one and the other was that Trump once upon a time President Trump suggested he could end the war in [[05:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19974.160000000003s)]
*  Ukraine in the first 24 hours of his presidency we're going to see a bit of a pause a reset and [[05:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19979.440000000002s)]
*  a different pace on those issues and in particular tariffs it does appear that many of his own [[05:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19987.04s)]
*  appointees with economic experience some of the billionaires there's 13 billionaires he's [[05:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=19994.16s)]
*  appointed to serve in his administration and some of them have sort of implored him to take a [[05:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20000.48s)]
*  different look at the way he thinks about the application of tariffs on specific goods not [[05:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20004.64s)]
*  just country by country in order to not significantly shake or weaken the U.S. economy [[05:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20011.44s)]
*  while he's trying to carry out sort of trade and foreign policy issues so but I also do think to [[05:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20018.64s)]
*  your point that inflation was an amazing campaign issue for him to run on because people felt the [[05:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20025.28s)]
*  pain of inflation and President Biden former now former President Biden and his administration [[05:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20033.359999999997s)]

*  inflation was painful for them there were strong fundamentals in the economy that would carry [[05:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20046.16s)]
*  America through this sort of post-COVID era and said people felt real pain I can't pay my rent [[05:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20050.88s)]

*  and instead only 20,000 people have the opportunity to be in the Capitol One arena for this moment [[05:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20245.920000000002s)]
*  that's about to happen now which will be very special for President Trump and for his supporters [[05:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20253.52s)]
*  to have a glimpse of the new president to hear from him and as has been flagged by the man [[05:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20259.120000000003s)]

*  take that action on day one and here we are on day one as we watch this motorcade travel along [[05:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20291.120000000003s)]

*  around this inauguration it always is but of course this year we had that assassination attempt on [[05:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20305.36s)]
*  President Trump in July and you can just see there he is arriving the Capitol One arena into [[05:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20312.48s)]

*  take a couple of minutes for him to disembark from that motorcade for the area to be sealed and then [[05:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20326.16s)]
*  we'll see him arrive up into that Capitol One arena in onto the floor of that sporting arena [[05:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20332.079999999998s)]

*  day for the individuals inside this Capitol One arena queued from the early hours and then they've [[05:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20366.56s)]

*  second address from President Trump now while we're waiting for President Trump there I want to [[05:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20377.280000000002s)]

*  around the world of course watching this day listening to what Donald Trump has to say he [[05:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20389.120000000003s)]
*  addressed a little foreign policy in his inaugural address this morning not too many details but how [[05:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20394.56s)]
*  will it have been received in London yeah hello to you the world has changed in America and the [[05:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20400.4s)]
*  world has changed in plenty of other places too because of America's influence and significance [[05:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20405.760000000002s)]
*  and so here in London you've had the Prime Minister putting a video out on social media [[05:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20411.760000000002s)]
*  congratulating President Trump in the last couple of hours talking about what UK Prime Ministers [[05:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20417.36s)]
*  always talk about which is the so-called special relationship between the UK and the US but what [[05:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20422.88s)]
*  intrigues me as someone who's going to follow this closely in the coming years is you've got two [[05:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20428.32s)]
*  leaders one in London one in Washington who could not be more different I mean it is an extraordinary [[05:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20433.52s)]
*  difference just of character you've got a human rights lawyer and a property brush property billionaire [[05:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20438.4s)]
*  from New York you've got a barrister against someone who found themselves you know in court [[05:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20446.640000000003s)]
*  as Donald Trump did and convicted so the differences of character and style are massive [[05:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20452.960000000003s)]
*  and then there are the policy differences which will also be fascinating to observe and the [[05:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20458.0s)]
*  Middle East on Ukraine on trade tariffs import taxes where exactly are they wielded by the new [[05:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20463.2s)]
*  president the row over the Chagos Islands the archipelago in the Indian Ocean where there's a [[05:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20470.48s)]
*  joint US UK military base where the UK government had decided to hand those islands to Mauritius and [[05:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20474.64s)]
*  then rent back the space for the military base that was paused to allow the new administration [[05:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20481.28s)]
*  to take a look at it that could be an awkward thing early on what does the new president say [[05:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20486.559999999998s)]
*  about defense spending he often wants allies other NATO members to spend far more on defense can the [[05:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20490.88s)]
*  UK and others afford it so there's so so many strands that are going to be fascinating to [[05:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20497.84s)]
*  unpick and at the heart of it will be the dynamic the human dynamic between the two men and because [[05:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20503.84s)]
*  they are so wildly different that's going to be fascinating to observe [[05:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20509.12s)]
*  and just wanted to get your thoughts Chris as well I've spotted here in Washington DC in recent days [[05:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20516.08s)]
*  former Prime Minister Boris Johnson former Prime Minister Liz Truss Nigel Farage is here he threw [[05:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20522.32s)]
*  a big party for Donald Trump for the inauguration Donald Trump wasn't there but for the inauguration [[05:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20528.56s)]
*  on Friday night so you have this very close relationship between those in the Conservative [[05:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20533.6s)]
*  Party and as you've been describing there with the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer [[05:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20539.039999999997s)]
*  yeah there's a definite difference there there's just no doubt about it you have a Prime Minister [[05:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20543.92s)]
*  here who is on the on the left describes himself as a socialist and you have a new US President [[05:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20548.64s)]
*  who is on the right so there's a difference there you see it with the if you like the friends from [[05:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20555.6s)]
*  British politics that were invited along whether it be Nigel Farage or Boris Johnson [[05:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20560.72s)]
*  or Liz Truss it's quite striking seeing Boris Johnson the former Prime Minister [[05:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20564.800000000003s)]
*  there in person witnessing the inauguration because what's interesting is that the two of [[05:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20568.48s)]
*  them Mr Johnson and Mr Trump clearly struck up a real rapport when they were both in positions of [[05:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20573.920000000002s)]
*  leadership on the issue of Ukraine they have been very very different in their instincts Boris Johnson [[05:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20579.36s)]
*  very very passionate about leading the UK's response to Ukraine when there was the full [[05:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20584.64s)]
*  scale invasion from Russia and we've heard the scepticism from Donald Trump and his plans to [[05:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20590.239999999998s)]
*  try and bring the conflict to a close pretty quickly and even though Boris Johnson and Liz [[05:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20594.559999999998s)]
*  Truss are politically very different from Keir Starmer on the Ukraine question Boris Johnson and [[05:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20600.16s)]
*  Keir Starmer are in exactly the same place the British government's position on Ukraine hasn't [[05:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20604.96s)]
*  changed even through successive Prime Ministers and a change of party governing the UK but yeah [[05:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20610.32s)]
*  there's no doubt there is a there is a difference there a difference of character different policy [[05:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20617.6s)]
*  instincts and then different worldview fundamentally and of course all this will be have to be navigated [[05:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20621.2s)]
*  by the incoming British Ambassador here at Lord Peter Mandelson and we will wait to see how he [[05:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20629.2s)]

*  heard that in his inaugural address and in those unscripted remarks that followed President Trump [[05:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20688.48s)]
*  saying Joe Biden had spent unlimited funds on the defense of foreign borders while refusing [[05:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20694.72s)]

*  he wants to get rid of birthright citizenship where anyone who's born in the country becomes [[05:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20820.480000000003s)]

*  certainly not in the way that he intends to do because it's in the constitution birthright [[05:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20835.120000000003s)]
*  citizenship is in the constitution and that is I'm sure there will be a legal challenge [[05:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20839.76s)]
*  nearly immediately. There's some more practical on the ground measures here too that he's talked [[05:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20844.0s)]
*  about one of them is getting rid of the Joe Biden policy there was this app that allowed people to [[05:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20848.239999999998s)]
*  actually apply online for something like asylum or immigration getting rid of that what would be the [[05:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20853.12s)]
*  effects of that do you think? Sure so the app you're referring to something called CBP one [[05:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20858.399999999998s)]
*  that app was already eliminated it's actually gone already and for the past couple of years that app [[05:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20863.359999999997s)]
*  has been the only way that an individual who came to the U.S. Mexico border was able to seek asylum [[05:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20869.2s)]
*  at the border and so with that app gone there's literally no way for a person who presents himself [[05:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20875.04s)]
*  at the U.S. Mexico border no matter their manner of entry to actually make a request for asylum [[05:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20879.760000000002s)]
*  so we think that that the determination of that app particularly when coupled with these pre-existing [[05:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20884.72s)]
*  rules is certainly illegal. He's been focusing in on some some gangs Latin American groups too [[05:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20889.84s)]
*  hasn't he? Designating them as as terrorist groups what do you make of that kind of language in these [[05:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20895.04s)]
*  orders? Sure that's another thing that is exceptionally harmful for immigrant communities [[05:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20900.16s)]
*  not only because many of the people who are coming to the United States to seek asylum [[05:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20905.440000000002s)]
*  for example are fleeing from those very organizations and if you take away the right to a proceeding [[05:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20909.600000000002s)]
*  for somebody who actually can try to explain what their what their case is about they're likely to [[05:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20915.280000000002s)]
*  be tagged as a member of those organizations without even having an opportunity to say [[05:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20919.920000000002s)]
*  it's not that I'm a member of that organization it's actually that I am fleeing from that [[05:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20924.56s)]
*  organization so the fact that those announcements are coupled with like stripping of the procedural [[05:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20928.08s)]
*  due process protections that an applicant for asylum in particular would seek is just really [[05:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20933.440000000002s)]
*  stark and what we expected. Let's talk about what's taking place here in Chicago and we are at the [[05:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20939.04s)]
*  headquarters of course of the National Immigrant Justice Center so I'm sure you've been tracking [[05:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20944.08s)]
*  closely these reports that we could see sometime maybe the next you know days or weeks here in [[05:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20947.920000000002s)]
*  Chicago some sort of immigration raid immigration authorities coming here to try to gather up those [[05:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20953.6s)]
*  who are undocumented and remove them from the country what are the legal hurdles when it comes [[05:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20960.32s)]
*  to something like that? Sure so we've been hearing all kinds of rumors about what's likely to happen [[05:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20965.039999999997s)]
*  here in Chicago ranging from 100 officers to several hundred officers ranging from a couple [[05:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20969.92s)]
*  of days to a multi-week operation we've heard them say that they're targeting only specific [[05:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20975.519999999997s)]
*  individuals but we've also heard them say things like they're targeting people who are recent [[05:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20980.72s)]
*  arrivals to the United States who might be living in shelters. Right. I'm referencing that because [[05:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20984.24s)]
*  the difference those things matter in terms of what they're allowed to do of course they are allowed [[05:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20989.52s)]
*  to go and pick up a person who is a known target but any but what we saw the last time this happened [[05:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20994.24s)]
*  and again it's important to remember that we have been here before exactly here President Trump [[05:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=20999.920000000002s)]
*  announced Tom Homan as his borders are and Mr. Homan was in charge of operations like this the [[05:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21005.28s)]
*  last time around where community members who lived in the same household as a person who was on the [[05:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21011.6s)]
*  list or even just happened to be in the vicinity of a person who was on the list were also taken [[05:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21016.879999999997s)]
*  into custody and that is illegal and that's something that we're very concerned about. [[05:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21021.52s)]
*  Yeah lots of concern obviously here in Chicago among the immigrant communities playing out we'll [[05:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21026.399999999998s)]
*  see how all this shakes out in the coming days. Okay Carl thank you very much for that interesting [[05:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21031.44s)]
*  to get the view from the ground in Chicago and I'm delighted to see that you've been able to move [[05:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21040.0s)]
*  indoors and heat up because it's even colder in Chicago than it is here in Washington DC today. [[05:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21044.719999999998s)]
*  Now I am joined with a guest by guest on our rooftop here again Staltenberg Chairman of the [[05:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21050.079999999998s)]
*  Munich Security Conference and of course most recently the Secretary General of NATO. Thanks [[05:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21054.719999999998s)]
*  so much for being with us here on BBC News. Now you were listening very closely I'm sure to what [[05:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21059.12s)]
*  President Trump was saying in his inaugural address he didn't give too many specifics [[05:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21064.48s)]
*  in relation to foreign policy but what did you make of what you heard? Well as you said it was [[05:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21069.039999999997s)]
*  mainly actually about domestic issues on foreign policy didn't say that much he said something [[05:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21074.16s)]
*  about peace to strength which is actually a message very much in line with NATO that we need to be [[05:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21081.12s)]
*  strong we need to be united to ensure that we preserve peace. Now he did speak again not [[05:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21087.6s)]
*  specifically but in a general way about US taxpayers money being used to fund and protect [[05:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21093.68s)]
*  borders in other countries not in this country a reference potentially to the Ukraine Russia [[05:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21099.76s)]
*  conflict and perhaps other places what did you make of that? Well that's a message which of course [[05:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21105.28s)]
*  raises some questions among European allies and those countries who are supporting Ukraine [[05:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21111.84s)]
*  because you all want the war in Ukraine to end but we know that the quickest way to end the war [[05:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21119.12s)]
*  is to lose a war but that will not bring peace that will bring occupation so therefore we need to [[05:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21124.8s)]
*  provide weapons to Ukraine to strengthen their position on the battlefield because that's the [[05:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21130.88s)]
*  only way to convince President Putin that he cannot win but had to sit down and [[05:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21136.4s)]
*  find a solution where Ukraine pervades as a sovereign independent nation. [[05:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21141.920000000002s)]
*  And when European leaders were here as you were last July for the NATO summit there was a lot of [[05:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21145.36s)]
*  side chatter about if President Trump got re-elected what that would mean for the European [[05:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21150.480000000003s)]
*  relationship such as it is for Ukraine what is the sense now where we are on this day? [[05:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21156.800000000003s)]
*  I think it's too early to say because for instance his closest advisor and special envoy on Ukraine [[05:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21163.2s)]
*  Kit Kellogg has stated very clearly that it has to be a solution based on strength again support [[05:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21171.600000000002s)]
*  Ukraine is the way to convince Putin that he cannot win. I don't think we can change Putin's [[05:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21178.72s)]
*  mind but I think we can change his calculus his mind sees that you want to control Ukraine but [[05:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21184.4s)]
*  his calculus may change if he realizes that the price he has to pay is too high and it's also [[05:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21190.0s)]
*  you have to remember that last time President Trump was president I remember very well because [[05:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21197.12s)]
*  then I was Secretary General of NATO he actually was the president that decided to start to provide [[05:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21202.4s)]
*  lethal aid to Ukraine and deliver the first javelins the anti-tank weapons that proved so [[05:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21208.16s)]
*  extremely important when Russia launched a full-fledged invasion so I think it's a bit early [[05:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21214.4s)]
*  too early to say but I think that the only message to European allies and those countries [[05:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21219.2s)]
*  who want more support to Ukraine is to engage with the new Trump administrations to sit down [[05:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21225.04s)]
*  and to tell that it matters what they do for Ukraine not only for Ukrainians but also for [[05:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21231.600000000002s)]
*  all of us. And you mentioned General Keith Kellogg there the incoming US Special Envoy to Ukraine [[05:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21237.36s)]
*  we had heard from President Trump on the campaign trail that he was going to solve the Ukraine-Russia [[05:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21243.04s)]
*  situation within 24 hours but we've heard from General Kellogg he's put a 90-day middle of May [[05:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21248.0s)]
*  sort of deadline on it has there been any further detail about how that might be achieved? [[05:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21253.6s)]
*  Not much and again I think this is very much about strengthening Ukraine to convince Putin [[05:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21259.2s)]
*  that he has to sit down the problem is not Ukraine they are invaded by another country so the problem [[05:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21265.52s)]
*  is Russia and of course the situation on the battlefield is difficult the Russians are pushing [[05:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21272.08s)]
*  but we need to remember where this started at the beginning of the war most experts believed that [[05:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21279.68s)]
*  Russia was going to take Kiev within days and the rest of Ukraine within weeks that didn't happen [[05:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21286.24s)]
*  the Ukrainians have liberated 50 percent of the territory that Russia occupied in the beginning [[05:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21292.960000000003s)]
*  of the war they're inflicting heavy losses on the Russian occupiers with more than a thousand [[05:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21298.48s)]
*  casualties per day and Russia has deployed 80 90 percent of the land forces and they have still [[05:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21303.12s)]
*  not been able to control Donbas so this is not a big success for President Putin. Okay well we'll [[05:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21310.399999999998s)]
*  wait to see I suppose what President Trump and his team do from here on out. Chair of the Munich [[05:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21316.96s)]
*  Security Conference Jan Stoltenberg thanks so much for being with us here BBC News in the cold we [[05:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21322.239999999998s)]
*  really do appreciate you doing that now plenty more is still to come here we are awaiting [[05:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21326.72s)]
*  President Donald Trump to come up onto the floor of the Capitol One arena and make some remarks [[05:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21331.84s)]
*  there addressing his supporters and we'll have that live do stay with us here on BBC News. [[05:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21337.04s)]
*  America [[05:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21386.72s)]
*  God bless America [[05:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21407.2s)]
*  Bow [[05:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21537.600000000002s)]
*  man [[05:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21559.440000000002s)]
*  I'm Katrina Perry here at the Capitol. [[05:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21596.72s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump has been sworn in as America's 47th president, beginning his second term [[06:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21617.280000000002s)]
*  in the White House in what he's promising will be a plan to reshape America. [[06:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21623.24s)]
*  He's only the second US president ever to serve two non-consecutive terms. [[06:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21628.84s)]
*  In his inaugural address, he promised the golden age of America begins right now, saying [[06:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21634.4s)]
*  he was saved by God to make America great again, referencing, of course, that assassination [[06:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21640.04s)]
*  attempt in July. [[06:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21646.120000000003s)]
*  He outlined a raft of executive orders, including the declaration of a national emergency at [[06:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21653.24s)]
*  the border with maximum diversity programs. [[06:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21665.800000000003s)]
*  In a break with convention, the inauguration ceremony was held indoors because of exceptionally [[06:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21668.800000000003s)]
*  cold weather here in Washington, DC today. [[06:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21674.52s)]
*  Now we're looking at live pictures there of the Capitol One arena. [[06:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21678.44s)]
*  This is where celebrations have moved to the Capitol One arena, where Donald Trump, we [[06:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21683.559999999998s)]
*  saw him arrive in his motorcade a little bit earlier. [[06:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21690.28s)]
*  He's gone underneath the building there, driving in through a loading dock through the security [[06:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21694.28s)]
*  entrance, and he will come up onto the floor of that Capitol One arena shortly. [[06:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21699.44s)]
*  20,000 people have gathered there for the inauguration parade. [[06:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21706.440000000002s)]
*  Well, it's usually a parade right through the streets of Washington, DC along Pennsylvania [[06:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21711.4s)]
*  Avenue, but that has also moved inside because of these exceptionally cold temperatures. [[06:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21716.600000000002s)]
*  But before he made his way to the Capitol One arena, there was the final ceremonial [[06:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21723.36s)]
*  act at Capitol Hill. [[06:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21728.04s)]
*  President Trump conducted an inspection of US troops as he returns to the role of Commander [[06:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21730.12s)]
*  in Chief in charge of the US military, and he said he'll rid the military of what he [[06:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21736.160000000003s)]
*  describes as woke policies. [[06:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21741.280000000002s)]
*  Well, outgoing President Joe Biden was present at the inauguration, and earlier today he [[06:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21743.600000000002s)]
*  issued preemptive pardons for five members of his family, for his siblings. [[06:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21749.52s)]
*  In a statement, former President Joe Biden said that his family members had been subjected [[06:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21754.68s)]
*  to unrelenting attacks and threats. [[06:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21761.08s)]
*  Those pardons followed on from another set of pardons that he issued early this morning, [[06:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21764.64s)]
*  issued to the Chief in charge of the COVID response, Anthony Fauci, and members of the [[06:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21769.84s)]
*  House of Representatives Investigation Committee into the attacks on January 6th, amongst a [[06:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21775.68s)]
*  few others. [[06:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21781.84s)]
*  Joe Biden said he was doing that in order to prevent what he called politically motivated [[06:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21782.84s)]
*  prosecutions. [[06:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21788.36s)]
*  Well, let's have a listen now to some of President Trump's inaugural address. [[06:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21789.36s)]
*  first. [[06:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21819.920000000002s)]
*  Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. [[06:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21829.52s)]
*  Our safety will be restored. [[06:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21832.9s)]
*  The scales of justice will be rebalanced. [[06:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21835.5s)]
*  The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government [[06:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21839.8s)]
*  will end. [[06:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21845.600000000002s)]
*  And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free. [[06:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21849.600000000002s)]
*  Well, President Trump is promising a flurry of executive actions on day one, on this first [[06:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21862.24s)]
*  day of his administration, and he's promised to take action on immigration, on energy and [[06:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21869.440000000002s)]
*  environmental regulations, on reducing crime, and a whole host of other issues. [[06:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21875.72s)]
*  During the remarks that he's made today, he has heaped criticism, though, on the administration [[06:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21880.52s)]
*  of his predecessor, Joe Biden, which he said had spent unlimited funds on the defense of [[06:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21885.24s)]
*  foreign borders while refusing to defend the borders of America. [[06:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21891.24s)]
*  President Trump was greeted with loud cheers throughout his address, not by all of the [[06:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21896.760000000002s)]
*  gathered crowd, though, we should say, particularly when he said that he would declare a national [[06:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21901.28s)]
*  emergency in relation to the situation at the southern border. [[06:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21906.44s)]
*  All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning [[06:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21911.24s)]
*  millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. [[06:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21917.5s)]
*  We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. [[06:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21924.46s)]
*  I will end the practice of catch and release. [[06:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21931.46s)]
*  And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. [[06:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21942.46s)]
*  While we are awaiting President Trump there into the floor of the Capital One arena, I [[06:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21954.66s)]
*  want to bring in Margaret Taleb. [[06:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21962.16s)]
*  She's senior contributor at Axios and director of the Syracuse University Institute for [[06:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21963.76s)]
*  Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship. [[06:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21968.6s)]
*  Margaret, thanks for being with us. [[06:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21971.96s)]
*  We're looking at these scenes coming to us here from the Capital One arena, where so [[06:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21973.86s)]
*  many of Donald Trump's supporters have been waiting all day long for this moment when [[06:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21977.36s)]
*  he will arrive shortly. [[06:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21982.059999999998s)]
*  And he has said that he's going to sign some executive actions there. [[06:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21983.76s)]
*  In fact, there's a desk set up on the stage for him to do just that. [[06:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21987.46s)]
*  What do you expect he's going to tackle first based on what we've heard from him so far? [[06:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21992.36s)]
*  Well, I certainly think, Katriana, that he's going to give some of this crowd what they [[06:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=21996.66s)]
*  came for. [[06:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22001.62s)]
*  And one of the things that he's brought the most into focus is the idea that he can use [[06:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22002.96s)]
*  executive orders to move quickly, to establish more controls along the southern border. [[06:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22009.96s)]
*  So I'd be surprised if we didn't see something along those lines. [[06:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22016.260000000002s)]
*  President Trump, of course, the reason that he was a household name the first time he [[06:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22020.46s)]
*  ran for president was because of his show, The Apprentice. [[06:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22026.16s)]
*  He is a showman. [[06:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22029.760000000002s)]
*  He understands whether you like his style of communication or not, whether you like [[06:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22031.260000000002s)]
*  what he has to say or not. [[06:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22035.36s)]
*  He understands communication at a level that most politicians would sort of kill for those [[06:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22036.859999999997s)]
*  instincts. [[06:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22041.46s)]
*  And he knows how to make a splash. [[06:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22041.96s)]
*  He's going to want to use this event here. [[06:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22044.559999999998s)]
*  He can't have the outdoor crowd size. [[06:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22047.96s)]
*  He can't have the sweep on the mall, but he's got everyone in that room. [[06:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22050.16s)]
*  It's the ultimate rally. [[06:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22053.859999999997s)]
*  And we're going to be able to see what he wants to prioritize. [[06:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22055.859999999997s)]
*  You know, I think today is such a day of pomp and circumstance. [[06:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22060.859999999997s)]
*  It's easy to spend a lot of focus on watching what he's saying, but it's probably more [[06:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22065.059999999998s)]
*  important to watch what he does and what he's been talking about in terms of the southern [[06:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22071.059999999998s)]
*  border is deploying U.S. [[06:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22075.76s)]
*  troops to the southern border and also trying to end birthright citizenship. [[06:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22077.46s)]
*  And I think here we're really going to see where what he's trying to do pushes up against [[06:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22083.26s)]
*  either existing laws, congressional separation of powers or the U.S. [[06:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22089.059999999998s)]
*  Constitution. [[06:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22093.059999999998s)]
*  Yes, you can deploy U.S. [[06:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22094.46s)]
*  troops to the southern border. [[06:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22096.06s)]
*  Many presidents, including Trump won and including the Biden administration, have done it in [[06:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22097.46s)]
*  times of emergency. [[06:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22103.06s)]
*  But what are you asking those troops to do? [[06:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22104.260000000002s)]
*  It's widely believed that there are real limits unless Congress specifically authorizes [[06:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22107.46s)]
*  powers. [[06:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22113.760000000002s)]
*  You can't use active duty U.S. [[06:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22114.56s)]
*  military to arrest migrants on site, to do searches and seizures, to discharge weapons, [[06:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22117.260000000002s)]
*  to do interrogations. [[06:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22123.96s)]
*  So what would you be having them do that's really different than what other administrations [[06:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22125.46s)]
*  have done? [[06:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22130.059999999998s)]
*  And on birthright citizenship, that is an idea protected in the U.S. [[06:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22131.059999999998s)]
*  Constitution. [[06:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22135.76s)]
*  Even if the new Trump administration is sort of looking for indirect ways to do an end [[06:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22137.76s)]
*  around on the U.S. [[06:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22142.86s)]
*  Constitution, you can be sure that will end up quickly in court and probably going to [[06:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22144.559999999998s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[06:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22149.86s)]
*  Even so, I think immigration is likely to be top of that pile you're seeing accumulate [[06:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22151.56s)]
*  on that desk in this crowded arena. [[06:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22156.06s)]
*  Okay, and just while we've been speaking there, Margaret, we've been looking at images [[06:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22160.36s)]
*  of some of President Trump's grandchildren and other friends and supporters just seated [[06:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22164.06s)]
*  in a VVVVVIP viewing box and those white armchair style seats inside on the floor of the Capital [[06:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22169.66s)]
*  One arena. [[06:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22178.86s)]
*  Of course, we saw the motorcade arrive about 15 or 20 minutes ago carrying President Trump, [[06:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22179.56s)]
*  first lady Melania Trump, and all of the children and grandchildren and various supporters there [[06:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22185.260000000002s)]
*  as we await his arrival. [[06:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22190.760000000002s)]
*  But first, while we are waiting for him to come in, I want to bring in now Mariana Spring, [[06:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22193.36s)]
*  BBC's social media investigations correspondent. [[06:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22197.56s)]
*  Mariana, thank you for being with us here. [[06:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22201.66s)]
*  Earlier, several prominent backers of Donald Trump took to the stage at the Capital One [[06:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22205.359999999997s)]
*  arena where we're watching there now, including the billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk. [[06:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22212.66s)]
*  And as we know, he is now a very close friend and confidant and advisor of President Trump. [[06:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22216.96s)]
*  One bit of his appearance, though, has caused some controversy. [[06:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22223.059999999998s)]
*  So let's just take a look at that and we'll talk about it in a moment. [[06:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22226.859999999997s)]
*  And I just want to say thank you for making it happen. [[06:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22230.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22236.46s)]
*  My heart goes out to you. [[06:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22243.46s)]
*  Now that gesture has become a talking point on social media with Elon Musk clearly being [[06:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22245.46s)]
*  heard saying, my heart goes out to you. [[06:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22254.76s)]
*  So some are seeing it as a sincere gesture, gesticulating to his heart and pushing it [[06:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22256.96s)]
*  out. [[06:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22262.26s)]
*  But others are likening it to a Nazi salute. [[06:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22263.26s)]
*  Even on Donald Trump's inauguration day, Elon Musk seems to be getting some of these [[06:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22265.559999999998s)]
*  spotlights. [[06:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22271.26s)]
*  So Mariana, who out of the social media bosses were there today and why is that important? [[06:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22272.26s)]
*  Thank you so much, Katrina. [[06:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22278.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly as you've highlighted there, really. [[06:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22280.16s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk of all of the social media bosses is the one who's been getting the most [[06:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22282.36s)]
*  attention, including following that clip of him making the gesture, which has sparked [[06:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22285.96s)]
*  more polarization online, people suggesting exactly like you say that it could be a Nazi [[06:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22290.66s)]
*  salute, other people saying, no, this was relevant to what he was saying about my heart [[06:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22295.46s)]
*  going out to you, and so on and so forth. [[06:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22298.86s)]
*  But it's just another example of how involved Elon Musk seems to have become, not just in [[06:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22300.96s)]
*  U.S. politics, but in this Donald Trump presidency, just as it's kind of getting underway, really. [[06:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22305.96s)]
*  And he was not the only boss, as you say, who was featured at the inauguration, who [[06:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22310.86s)]
*  was there, prominently visible. [[06:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22314.559999999998s)]
*  Bosses of all of the big social media and tech companies, everyone from Mark Zuckerberg [[06:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22316.76s)]
*  of Meta to Google, Apple, OpenAI, all of the different companies that are involved in this [[06:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22321.059999999998s)]
*  space were there and prominent. [[06:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22327.559999999998s)]
*  I think that tells us something important, not only about how close some of these people, [[06:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22328.86s)]
*  Elon Musk in particular, seem to be to the new president, but also actually how social [[06:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22334.36s)]
*  media is entering perhaps a new era under Donald Trump, that a lot of these bosses are [[06:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22339.859999999997s)]
*  people who are increasingly powerful and important. [[06:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22344.859999999997s)]
*  Their platforms shape the national conversation and the international conversation, and they're [[06:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22348.859999999997s)]
*  also very rich and influential in lots of other ways, too. [[06:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22353.059999999998s)]
*  And so they seem to be people that, Donald Trump at least, is very keen to have around [[06:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22356.059999999998s)]
*  him and visible. [[06:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22361.059999999998s)]
*  People might have also seen other clips of them gesturing, Elon Musk, for example, sitting [[06:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22362.059999999998s)]
*  behind Barron Trump at the inauguration, doing a thumbs up when there was a suggestion of [[06:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22365.559999999998s)]
*  going to Mars and all sorts of stuff like that. [[06:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22370.36s)]
*  Just while we're talking, Mariana, we're looking at pictures there from inside the [[06:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22374.76s)]
*  Capital One arena. [[06:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22377.86s)]
*  We can see Jared Kushner there. [[06:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22378.86s)]
*  He's in that special seating area talking to Donald Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary [[06:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22380.76s)]
*  Howard Lipnick and also to the Florida Congressman, Warren Donald, who is a very close ally and [[06:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22385.86s)]
*  advisor of Donald Trump as well. [[06:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22392.059999999998s)]
*  And that point that you were making about the seating arrangements inside the rotunda [[06:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22394.559999999998s)]
*  earlier for the inauguration ceremony, given how those CEOs of the technology companies [[06:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22398.46s)]
*  were kind of stitched and woven in between the individuals that we're looking at now [[06:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22403.86s)]
*  who have been picked to be in Donald Trump's cabinet. [[06:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22408.46s)]
*  And it kind of goes slightly to what Joe Biden was talking about in his farewell address [[06:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22412.36s)]
*  last week, doesn't it, when he was giving these warnings about how a small number of [[06:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22416.86s)]
*  extremely wealthy people have a lot of power and they have a lot of influence because [[06:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22421.46s)]
*  of their control over these social media platforms? [[06:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22426.559999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and I think it's important to remember that when someone like Elon Musk, for example, [[06:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22428.66s)]
*  decided to buy what was Twitter and is now called X, he made a really big point of emphasizing [[06:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22432.66s)]
*  the importance of freedom of expression, something he continues to talk about. [[06:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22437.26s)]
*  And in particular, his concerns that the old Twitter was too aligned with the U.S. government [[06:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22440.46s)]
*  at the time, that it was censoring certain parts of speech. [[06:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22445.66s)]
*  Now Elon Musk continues to talk about freedom of expression, but he is incredibly closely [[06:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22448.86s)]
*  associated with Donald Trump, not least because he is his pick for this kind of body, this [[06:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22452.56s)]
*  department that doesn't exist at the moment, at least, the Department of Government Efficiency [[06:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22459.06s)]
*  that Donald Trump is creating. [[06:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22463.46s)]
*  And so you're in this new situation where some of these tech bros, particularly someone [[06:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22465.06s)]
*  like Elon Musk, who has positioned themselves as almost being sort of anti-government, anti-establishment, [[06:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22468.76s)]
*  are now very much sitting alongside the U.S. president. [[06:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22473.06s)]
*  We've seen as well changes in some of the policies and ideas of social media companies [[06:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22477.460000000003s)]
*  like Metta, which owns Instagram and Facebook. [[06:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22481.16s)]
*  So Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Metta, came out to make changes to the site, again, kind [[06:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22483.460000000003s)]
*  of in line with these ideas about freedom of expression, which Donald Trump has been [[06:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22487.66s)]
*  a really strong advocate for and seeming to align themselves much more with him politically [[06:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22491.460000000003s)]
*  in terms of the decisions they're making at the sites. [[06:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22497.58s)]
*  And obviously one of the big kind of outstanding questions over the next few weeks is what [[06:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22500.16s)]
*  happens to TikTok. [[06:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22503.5s)]
*  Donald Trump made a really big point yesterday at the rally that he gave of saying how he [[06:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22505.46s)]
*  plans to save TikTok, that TikTok is going to be OK, that they're going to work out a [[06:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22511.26s)]
*  plan. [[06:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22515.059999999998s)]
*  TikTok is in a little bit of hot water in the United States because there's been the [[06:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22516.059999999998s)]
*  decision by the Supreme Court to uphold this ruling that they need to sell the company [[06:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22520.16s)]
*  because of allegations around their ownership and that somehow they're connected to the [[06:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22524.86s)]
*  Chinese government. [[06:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22528.54s)]
*  TikTok denies those allegations. [[06:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22529.54s)]
*  Again, all of this seems to be about how the social media companies and Donald Trump get [[06:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22531.760000000002s)]
*  along with one another and what that tells us about, I guess, what their future holds [[06:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22536.120000000003s)]
*  and what they're going to feel like as platforms over the next four years. [[06:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22540.32s)]
*  We'll have to wait and see. [[06:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22544.16s)]
*  Just while we've been talking there, Mariana, we have seen Donald Trump's children arrive [[06:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22546.800000000003s)]
*  into the arena. [[06:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22551.280000000002s)]
*  We can see Florida Congressman Byron Donalds there and there. [[06:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22552.280000000002s)]
*  We have Tiffany Trump, we have Ivanka Trump, Lara Trump, who of course is married to Eric [[06:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22554.440000000002s)]
*  Trump beside her, Lara Trump, the co-chair of the RNC and Donald [[06:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22559.24s)]
*  Jr. and Byron Trump there as well. [[06:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22564.84s)]
*  They were all invited to stand just a few moments ago for a round of applause. [[06:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22567.72s)]
*  And now all of the guests in that VIP seating section, you can see them there standing for [[06:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22571.8s)]
*  recognition from those who are gathered in the Capital One arena. [[06:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22577.68s)]
*  I think we can safely conclude that as all of those people are in their seats, that we [[06:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22581.96s)]
*  can't be too far away from the man himself, Donald Trump, arriving into the arena shortly. [[06:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22585.8s)]
*  I want to bring in Jake La Turner, former Republican congressman from Kansas. [[06:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22592.48s)]
*  Jake, thanks for being with us. [[06:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22596.84s)]
*  You're of course only former by a matter of weeks. [[06:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22598.079999999998s)]
*  You were in this Congress until just before the Christmas there when the last session [[06:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22600.399999999998s)]
*  ran out. And just wondering what you make of what Mariana has been talking about there [[06:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22605.64s)]
*  in terms of this relationship between the social media companies and President Trump [[06:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22610.760000000002s)]
*  and how we might see that evolving over time. [[06:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22615.64s)]
*  We have to take a serious look at this because when I was in Congress, I voted to make sure [[06:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22618.960000000003s)]
*  that we put common sense regulations in place, especially for children. [[06:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22624.68s)]
*  I'm a father of four kids and we have to look at the impact that this is having on our [[06:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22629.440000000002s)]
*  children and on our society. [[06:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22635.48s)]
*  Certainly, free speech is incredibly important in this country. [[06:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22638.24s)]
*  We cannot infringe upon it, but we have to put common sense tools in place for parents [[06:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22643.440000000002s)]
*  to help raise their children and make it straightforward and simple. [[06:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22649.32s)]
*  And I think that that can happen. [[06:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22655.32s)]
*  I think the Trump administration and the 77 million people that voted for him are very [[06:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22658.0s)]
*  much in line with the idea that we need to take a common sense approach to issues like this. [[06:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22663.8s)]
*  OK, I just want to bring in Joy Cheney, who is a Democratic strategist who's with us now. [[06:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22672.84s)]
*  Joy, you wanted to respond to that. [[06:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22678.719999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't have a specific response to that, but I think that we're in this moment [[06:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22681.92s)]
*  where we're going to have to make a decision about how we're moving forward. [[06:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22688.32s)]
*  Democrats going to have to figure out how much they want to work with Donald Trump and [[06:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22692.48s)]
*  whether or not we're going to have an oligarchy or whether we're going to have a democracy. [[06:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22697.64s)]
*  And I think there are a lot of Americans who are real concerned today with the comments [[06:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22703.0s)]
*  that have made not just about what the border, I think many of us agree that we have to close [[06:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22707.239999999998s)]
*  our borders in a way that protects America. [[06:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22710.88s)]
*  But we also believe that we have to have a way of protecting ourselves from foreign [[06:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22714.04s)]
*  adversaries who might be able to come through social media. [[06:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22718.6s)]
*  And also, if we pass a law like we did with TikTok, you know, we have to be able to enforce it. [[06:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22722.08s)]
*  And so to have a president who then says, you know, I'm not going to enforce the law does [[06:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22727.96s)]
*  seem like they're grooming us for some kind of authoritarianism that will become a problem, [[06:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22733.68s)]
*  not just with TikTok, but things going forward. [[06:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22738.96s)]
*  So, you know, there are a lot of concerns today and we're going to see how it plays out. [[06:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22741.120000000003s)]
*  Well, we do have to point out, Joy, that President Biden, first of all, said he wasn't [[06:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22748.0s)]
*  going to enforce the law because of the time left in his administration. [[06:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22751.64s)]
*  He was going to leave it to President Trump, who said that he has put a deadline on looking [[06:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22755.039999999997s)]
*  at this again. He's just issued a temporary extension to the situation because there is [[06:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22760.239999999998s)]
*  that shared view about the national security risk involved here. [[06:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22765.28s)]
*  Jake La Turner isn't there? [[06:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22769.84s)]
*  He is. Again, I was one that voted to ban TikTok or force them to divest. [[06:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22771.92s)]
*  And you saw the Supreme Court uphold that. [[06:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22779.0s)]
*  I think that it makes a lot of sense. [[06:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22781.12s)]
*  We should not partake in China's ability to control an enormous part of the narrative [[06:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22783.039999999997s)]
*  here in the United States. [[06:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22793.399999999998s)]
*  And we see their collection of information. [[06:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22795.079999999998s)]
*  We see their purchasing of land near high, high value targets within the American [[06:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22797.44s)]
*  intelligence community. [[06:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22806.0s)]
*  And so it's an enormous concern. [[06:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22807.399999999998s)]
*  You saw, as you pointed out, the Biden administration say that they would not enforce [[06:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22809.84s)]
*  that. I hope that the Trump administration will. [[06:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22813.8s)]
*  We do not have to ban TikTok in this country, but China should divest. [[06:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22817.120000000003s)]
*  And I think it makes a lot of sense for our national security. [[06:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22821.16s)]
*  OK, now we're just looking at these pictures in the Capital One arena. [[06:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22827.04s)]
*  There we have Donald Trump's children. [[06:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22831.120000000003s)]
*  We have most of his grandchildren, except, I think, the very smallest ones. [[06:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22833.280000000002s)]
*  He has 10 grandchildren. [[06:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22837.16s)]
*  And as he announced the other day, his daughter, Tiffany Trump, is expecting his 11th [[06:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22838.36s)]
*  grandchild at the moment. [[06:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22843.36s)]
*  And so we are waiting on Donald Trump to come and take to that stage at the Capital One [[06:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22845.6s)]
*  arena. Now, as we've been reporting all day and it has marked the coverage and marked [[06:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22851.079999999998s)]
*  the inauguration from start to finish, the decision to move most of the proceedings [[06:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22855.64s)]
*  indoors because of the well below freezing temperatures here in Washington, D.C., [[06:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22860.4s)]
*  220 or so thousand tickets had been issued for the National Mall and the streets around [[06:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22865.920000000002s)]
*  for people to watch these ceremonies. [[06:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22871.2s)]
*  And instead, just 20,000 have been able to get into that Capital One arena that we're [[06:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22873.600000000002s)]
*  watching here at the moment. [[06:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22879.08s)]
*  So what a lot of the supporters have done, they were already in Washington anyway, is [[06:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22880.44s)]
*  that they have headed to nearby hostelries to get in out of the cold and watch the [[06:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22885.12s)]
*  proceedings on big screens there, which has led to something of a festival atmosphere [[06:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22890.44s)]
*  or a big game day type atmosphere around Washington, notwithstanding the cold. [[06:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22895.879999999997s)]
*  And I want to go now over to a pub not too far from us here in Washington, where our [[06:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22900.879999999997s)]
*  correspondent, Helena Humphrey, is standing by. [[06:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22905.8s)]
*  Helena, what is it like for you are now? [[06:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22909.239999999998s)]
*  A little bit warmer, I think, Katrina, than where you are currently. [[06:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22914.8s)]
*  Welcome to the Union pub here in Washington, D.C. [[06:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22918.280000000002s)]
*  on Capitol Hill, a self-proclaimed bipartisan bar. [[06:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22921.480000000003s)]
*  But if you take a look at the scene behind me, what you'll be able to see is quite a [[06:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22925.280000000002s)]
*  lot. Make America great again, hats, the doors have been open since 9 a.m. [[06:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22929.440000000002s)]
*  here, whether people are celebrating or the few people who appear to be commiserating [[06:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22935.280000000002s)]
*  here. There is a lot of alcohol flowing. [[06:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22940.56s)]
*  They are drinking something called the presidential pitcher of Pilsner. [[06:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22943.16s)]
*  Not easy for broadcast journalists to say. [[06:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22947.36s)]
*  But among the crowds here, I met Jason Lyons, who I want to bring in. [[06:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22950.36s)]
*  He is a Trump supporter and donor on his way to one of the inaugural halls [[06:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22954.6s)]
*  tonight. How's the day been so far? [[06:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22959.76s)]
*  First of all, it's freezing. It's very cold, very difficult to get anywhere. [[06:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22961.84s)]
*  But I'm still happy I came, even though I came from Florida. [[06:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22966.079999999998s)]
*  Well, that is a frank assessment. [[06:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22968.92s)]
*  Of course, you are coming from Florida where it's a lot warmer. [[06:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22970.2s)]
*  You were just showing me a picture of you and Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. [[06:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22973.04s)]
*  In recent months, a lot of coming and goings from tech titans, industry titans. [[06:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22977.84s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[06:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22983.440000000002s)]
*  A lot of them came late to the party. [[06:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22984.64s)]
*  First time I was with them was at the 1988 Republican convention. [[06:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22987.16s)]
*  We were there together. [[06:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22991.68s)]
*  It was in New Orleans in the French Quarter, and I've been 100 percent behind [[06:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22993.72s)]
*  him the whole time. He knows it. [[06:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=22998.68s)]
*  I did two major events at Mar-a-Lago for the Wall Street Conference, [[06:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23000.52s)]
*  and I'm really happy for today. [[06:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23006.2s)]
*  I think today America has got its step back. [[06:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23008.0s)]
*  And what do you think the next four years will look like? [[06:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23010.96s)]
*  I mean, respect. [[06:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23013.28s)]
*  The United States lost respect. [[06:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23015.28s)]
*  And, you know, all these people that are, like you alluded to, kissing up to him [[06:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23017.96s)]
*  right now, it's because they respect him. [[06:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23022.36s)]
*  They fear him. But the truth is, he happens to be a pretty nice guy, [[06:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23024.76s)]
*  but he's a counterpuncher. [[06:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23029.28s)]
*  If you go after him, he'll come after you twice as hard. [[06:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23030.52s)]
*  I don't think he's going to be vengeful. [[06:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23034.399999999998s)]
*  I think he's going to do everything he can to get this country back on track. [[06:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23035.92s)]
*  I don't think he likes when people take advantage of us. [[06:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23039.559999999998s)]
*  He doesn't like when we get ripped off, tariffs, so on and so forth. [[06:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23043.48s)]
*  But I think respect is really what it comes down to. [[06:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23048.12s)]
*  The United States, as of right now, has a lot of respect. [[06:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23050.64s)]
*  You mentioned tariffs there. [[06:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23053.719999999998s)]
*  I know I'm bringing up something financial whilst we stand here in a pub. [[06:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23055.32s)]
*  There's also been a warning from the IMF about his economic policy [[06:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23058.68s)]
*  and that it could have a blowback impact on the United States. [[06:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23062.8s)]
*  You at all worried about that? [[06:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23066.440000000002s)]
*  I think the issue is being taken advantage of. [[06:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23067.68s)]
*  The United States pays more than their share. [[06:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23071.48s)]
*  I'm afraid we do have to leave it there. [[06:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23074.84s)]
*  OK. Thank you so much for being with us. [[06:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23076.28s)]
*  And we'll throw it back to you. [[06:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23078.440000000002s)]
*  OK. OK. Thanks for that, Helena. [[06:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23080.68s)]
*  Yes, we just see now President Donald Trump [[06:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23082.920000000002s)]
*  and First Lady Melania Trump arriving. [[06:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23086.04s)]
*  There they are, arriving in at the corporate level, in on to the floor [[06:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23089.079999999998s)]
*  there of the Capital One arena. [[06:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23093.96s)]
*  Just a moment ago, we saw the vice president, [[06:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23095.92s)]
*  JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance arrive with their three children. [[06:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23098.44s)]
*  And this is the moment that these supporters have been waiting for [[06:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23102.92s)]
*  since early this morning. [[06:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23107.88s)]
*  The chance to glimpse President Donald Trump, [[06:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23109.6s)]
*  First Lady Melania Trump and all his family and all his cabinet and friends. [[06:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23113.280000000002s)]
*  They've come from all over America for this moment. [[06:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23117.84s)]
*  The chance for a few words, the chance for a handshake, [[06:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23121.08s)]
*  the chance for a selfie, the chance to see the man that they voted for, [[06:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23124.600000000002s)]
*  the man they wanted to see as 47th president of the United States. [[06:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23129.36s)]
*  Donald Trump arriving there, you can hear the strings of Hail to the Chief [[06:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23136.16s)]
*  playing in the background. [[06:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23140.84s)]
*  And you can get a sense of what a special moment this is [[06:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23143.0s)]
*  for all of these supporters crammed into the Capital One arena there. [[06:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23154.64s)]
*  They didn't have the chance to cram on to the National Mall [[06:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23161.56s)]
*  and see the traditional inauguration ceremony. [[06:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23164.64s)]
*  They watched it on a big screen here in the Capital One arena. [[06:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23167.6s)]
*  But this is the moment they've been waiting for. [[06:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23172.0s)]
*  And this is a rare moment. [[06:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23175.0s)]
*  I suppose you could say the upside of things being moved indoors [[06:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23177.0s)]
*  was the chance for people, supporters of Donald Trump, [[06:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23180.68s)]
*  to get so close to the president and the first lady. [[06:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23184.04s)]
*  They would not have had this opportunity [[06:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23187.52s)]
*  had the traditional parade happened. [[06:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23191.600000000002s)]
*  And we can see there Donald Trump is carrying a folder [[06:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23194.24s)]
*  with the presidential seal of office on it. [[06:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23196.84s)]
*  He's got a lot of papers inside. [[06:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23199.24s)]
*  He's pointed to it, to loud cheers from the audience. [[06:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23201.24s)]
*  So we can only assume that that must be some of these actions [[06:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23204.64s)]
*  that he's been speaking about all day, that he said he would wait [[06:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23208.48s)]
*  till he got here to this moment with his supporters [[06:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23212.4s)]
*  to take these actions. [[06:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23216.88s)]
*  Of course, he's been pledging right through the campaign trail [[06:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23218.4s)]
*  that he would take action on day one. [[06:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23221.440000000002s)]
*  And here he is now. [[06:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23224.4s)]
*  He's put that folder on the podium. [[06:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23225.72s)]
*  He's doing his trademark dance move. [[06:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23228.120000000003s)]
*  Of course, we've become so familiar with that, [[06:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23230.36s)]
*  with all of the rallies. [[06:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23232.52s)]
*  Let's have a listen now to that support and that love for him there. [[06:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23234.52s)]
*  You can really hear the crowds cheering for Donald Trump there. [[06:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23259.08s)]
*  He was doing that trademark fist bump, of course, made famous [[06:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23264.440000000002s)]
*  on that field in Butler, Pennsylvania, in the middle of July, [[06:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23269.440000000002s)]
*  that assassination attempt when a bullet grazed his right ear. [[06:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23273.120000000003s)]
*  He's spoken about that in both of the speeches [[06:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23277.08s)]
*  that he has delivered today, about how that changed him, [[06:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23279.920000000002s)]
*  about how he feels that God saved him so that he could, as he said, [[06:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23284.08s)]
*  make America great again, that that has motivated him [[06:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23287.88s)]
*  to run again for this office, [[06:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23291.88s)]
*  to take all of the actions that he has outlined [[06:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23295.280000000002s)]
*  and all of the remarks that he's made. [[06:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23298.2s)]
*  You see their Vice President, JD Vance, beside him. [[06:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23299.960000000003s)]
*  And Melania Trump, First Lady, and Usha Vance, the Second Lady. [[06:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23303.68s)]
*  And there we go, fight, fight, fight. [[06:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23307.8s)]
*  Of course, they were the words that he issued [[06:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23309.64s)]
*  on that stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, [[06:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23313.08s)]
*  when Secret Service agents wrestled him to safety, [[06:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23315.4s)]
*  and then he was seen emerging with blood on his face, [[06:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23318.4s)]
*  that fist bump in the air, and those words, [[06:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23322.0s)]
*  fight, fight, fight, which have become the battle cry, [[06:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23324.4s)]
*  the rally call for Donald Trump all through this campaign, [[06:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23328.600000000002s)]
*  which was intense at times, very extreme rhetoric exchanged [[06:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23333.4s)]
*  by Joe Biden and Donald Trump and then by Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, [[06:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23337.800000000003s)]
*  and all culminating in that moment that we saw a little earlier, [[06:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23342.0s)]
*  Donald Trump sworn into office, the 45th President of America, [[06:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23346.2s)]
*  becoming the 47th President of America. [[06:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23350.8s)]
*  ...and now present a selection of participants [[06:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23354.8s)]
*  for the 2025 Presidential Inaugural Parade. [[06:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23357.2s)]
*  We're going to see a little of the inaugural parade. [[06:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23366.8s)]
*  And again, this is something that would usually take place [[06:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23370.4s)]
*  on that journey from Capitol Hill to the White House [[06:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23374.4s)]
*  along Pennsylvania Avenue past Freedom Plaza, [[06:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23377.600000000002s)]
*  but instead, because of the well below zero temperatures, [[06:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23381.600000000002s)]
*  well below freezing temperatures here, has been moved inside. [[06:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23385.2s)]
*  So there's a version of the parade happening here [[06:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23388.8s)]
*  inside the Capitol One arena. [[06:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23392.8s)]
*  We saw a little of it on Capitol Hill earlier. [[06:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23394.2s)]
*  ... [[06:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23400.2s)]
*  And, Cheikhla Turner, just to bring you back in here, [[06:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23408.2s)]
*  here we have the Fire and Rescue Services from Butler County. [[06:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23410.2s)]
*  Of course, we've just been discussing that [[06:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23414.8s)]
*  and one of their own, Corey Comperatore, of course, lost his life [[06:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23417.4s)]
*  in that attempted assassination on Donald Trump. [[06:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23423.4s)]
*  He's saluting them. [[06:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23426.600000000002s)]
*  And we remember from the RNC when Donald Trump made his address there that the uniform worn [[06:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23428.0s)]
*  by Corey Comperatore was on the stage at the RNC and in the middle of his remarks Donald [[06:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23434.12s)]
*  Trump went over and embraced that uniform and there we have it. [[06:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23438.92s)]
*  There is the uniform of Corey Comperatore being paraded in here inside the Capital One Arena. [[06:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23443.28s)]
*  Very poignant moment, just bring you in there Jake Platerner watching all of this here. [[06:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23455.04s)]
*  It just really, it's such a poignant moment you would imagine for Donald Trump but for [[06:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23461.920000000002s)]
*  everyone in Butter County, Pennsylvania, their county is known for this attack on the former [[06:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23467.600000000002s)]
*  president. [[06:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23473.88s)]
*  It's a beautiful moment, it's very sad, it's very tragic as you look at this and it's completely [[06:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23475.440000000002s)]
*  appropriate that President Trump should choose to honor this individual with the tragedy [[06:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23482.8s)]
*  that happened this summer. [[06:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23488.519999999997s)]
*  If you look back at this summer at a more broader lens, it was so historic what happened. [[06:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23490.44s)]
*  President Biden dropping out of the race was historic. [[06:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23498.019999999997s)]
*  President Trump and two assassination attempts was historic. [[06:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23502.699999999997s)]
*  It's just crazy the political dynamics that led up to today and here we see President [[06:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23507.92s)]
*  Trump and his family rightly celebrating a well deserved victory that they worked very [[06:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23515.12s)]
*  hard for. [[06:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23519.96s)]
*  You can see in their face the joy that they're experiencing and how different this day would [[06:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23521.539999999997s)]
*  be had it been President Biden or President Harris sitting on this stage right now. [[06:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23527.28s)]
*  President Trump was in a very precarious position legally and here you see the American people [[06:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23534.8s)]
*  decided to choose him for this role and he's got a very aggressive agenda. [[06:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23541.399999999998s)]
*  Indeed this moment here honoring the first responders of Butler, Pennsylvania but it's [[06:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23550.399999999998s)]
*  also honoring first responders right across the nation because we've seen in the last [[06:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23554.68s)]
*  12 months, in the last three months indeed a real toll put on first responders in this [[06:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23560.68s)]
*  country, those who were required to respond to hurricanes on the east side of the country [[06:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23568.079999999998s)]
*  and of course those who are dealing with the Los Angeles fires. [[06:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23573.12s)]
*  And here we have a moment of silence for Corey Compertory. [[06:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23577.399999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. [[06:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23590.48s)]
*  That moment of silence for the firefighter from Butler County, Pennsylvania, Corey Compertory, [[06:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23597.48s)]
*  who paid with his life for being on duty at that Donald Trump rally. [[06:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23614.48s)]
*  He was attending it also with some of his family members. [[06:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23621.48s)]
*  Now here we have the New York Military Academy arriving in there and we can bring in Margaret [[06:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23624.48s)]
*  Taleb here. [[06:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23632.48s)]
*  Margaret, this is really quite the unusual scene isn't it that we're seeing this parade [[06:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23633.48s)]
*  inside the Capital One Arena. [[06:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23638.48s)]
*  Well that's right, the scale of a typical outdoor inauguration is vast. [[06:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23641.48s)]
*  You have all that area of the national mall that stretched from the Capitol building over [[06:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23645.48s)]
*  to the White House. [[06:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23651.48s)]
*  You can fit a couple hundred thousand people and you're trying to condense that into a [[06:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23652.48s)]
*  tenth of that crowd size but still get the kind of the old school color of an inauguration, [[06:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23658.48s)]
*  the sort of the fife and drum and the marching spectacle and all the sort of thing. [[06:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23667.48s)]
*  We know that for President Trump in particular he loves a good parade. [[06:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23672.48s)]
*  And so this is a pretty good adaptation on a very quick turn. [[06:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23679.48s)]
*  And you know a very quick turn for an event is one thing, a very quick turn for an administration [[06:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23685.48s)]
*  is another. [[06:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23692.48s)]
*  We have been expecting them all day long to come out of the gate with several dozen, a [[06:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23693.48s)]
*  hundred, maybe two hundred executive actions. [[06:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23698.48s)]
*  Today's proceedings are quite delayed. [[06:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23701.48s)]
*  We expected him to be back at the White House by now signing orders there. [[06:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23705.48s)]
*  So some of the White House apparently is going to come here to this arena where we're watching [[06:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23712.48s)]
*  this unfold. [[06:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23718.48s)]
*  That is, that's not typical but why would he do anything typically? [[06:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23719.48s)]
*  And to your point about Butler, Pennsylvania, there is a bit of the, I don't know what the [[06:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23724.48s)]
*  right word is, macabre or at least certainly very serious aspect. [[06:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23729.48s)]
*  You have a large scale event, whether it's outdoors or indoors, concerns about any president's [[06:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23733.48s)]
*  safety because in the United States' relatively short history and only several dozen all men [[06:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23739.48s)]
*  have ever been president, you know, four presidents have been assassinated. [[06:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23747.48s)]
*  Several other presidents have faced attempts, have been shot out, you know, Donald Trump [[06:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23753.48s)]
*  for one, twice in one campaign year. [[06:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23759.48s)]
*  Andrew Jackson was shot out, Teddy Roosevelt and FDR. [[06:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23764.48s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[06:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23768.48s)]
*  It is a dangerous job to be president and for all of the barriers and protocols and [[06:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23770.48s)]
*  security checks and badges and, you know, magnetometers that you have to walk through, [[06:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23776.48s)]
*  it is a high profile and dangerous job, especially in an emotionally polarized climate like the [[06:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23782.48s)]
*  one we are in today. [[06:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23790.48s)]
*  And we're watching many of the groups participate to Donald Trump. [[06:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23793.48s)]
*  We saw the New York Military Academy there a little earlier, of course. [[06:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23798.48s)]
*  He attended the New York Military Academy as a young man. [[06:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23801.48s)]
*  Then we saw the Palm Beach First Responders Parade through, of course, Palm Beach. [[06:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23804.48s)]
*  Here we have the New York City Police Department marching through with their pipe band there. [[06:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23809.48s)]
*  The NYPD there with their shamrock, of course. [[06:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23816.48s)]
*  Many Irish Americans in the New York Police Department and viewers would be used to seeing [[06:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23822.48s)]
*  them march through many parades here in the U.S. [[06:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23827.48s)]
*  The inaugural parade but also in the big St. Patrick's Day parade that goes along Fifth Avenue [[06:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23830.48s)]
*  in New York right past Trump Tower in New York. [[06:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23836.48s)]
*  So a lot of the groups that are taking part in this parade have a very, very close relationship [[06:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23840.48s)]
*  to President Trump himself. [[06:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23847.48s)]
*  You can see him here. [[06:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23849.48s)]
*  He's pointing, clapping, saying thank you to those who are marching. [[06:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23851.48s)]
*  And to your point, Margaret, and we hear this often from presidents and vice presidents passing [[06:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23854.48s)]
*  presidents, don't we, about just how grateful they are to those members of the Secret Service [[06:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23859.48s)]
*  who are around them, keeping them safe and also their families safe. [[06:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23864.48s)]
*  And speaking of families, JD Vance's three small children, I think, are at risk of stealing [[06:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23869.48s)]
*  the show here because the two little boys have been marching up and down having their own [[06:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23875.48s)]
*  form of a parade in the viewing box there as they see everyone marching past them there. [[06:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23879.48s)]
*  And take all of this, I mean, there was that poignant and somber moment with Butler County, [[06:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23887.48s)]
*  but it is primarily a major celebration of Donald Trump's victory, isn't it? [[06:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23892.48s)]
*  It really is. [[06:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23898.48s)]
*  And done the very best that they can with having an inaugural celebration inside. [[06:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23901.48s)]
*  And in many ways, the American people and the world, they are going to get a more in-depth taste [[06:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23909.48s)]
*  of Donald Trump's agenda, where his headspace is, because it was done this way more than they would [[06:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23917.48s)]
*  have with inaugural parade if Donald Trump just walked outside a little bit. [[06:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23924.48s)]
*  They're going to get to hear from him again and understand what his priorities are, [[06:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23928.48s)]
*  how passionately he feels about any given issue. [[06:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23932.48s)]
*  And he made this decision, keep in mind, just a few days ago. [[06:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23936.48s)]
*  So to just make this decision a few days ago, putting that together at the Capitol today, [[06:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23941.48s)]
*  putting this event together, they've done a real remarkable job with the pomp and circumstance, [[06:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23946.48s)]
*  making sure that it's coordinated as well as it possibly can be. [[06:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23952.48s)]
*  It has not been flawless, of course, but they have done a nice job [[06:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23956.48s)]
*  and rightly celebrating a big victory this last November. [[06:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23961.48s)]
*  And what we're looking at here, of course, is a celebration of JD Vance. [[06:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23966.48s)]
*  This is some cheerleaders and a military band from Ohio, of course, [[06:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23973.48s)]
*  the state that he was the senator of just until a couple of weeks ago. [[06:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23978.48s)]
*  Having a listen in there to see, are they making a chant here? [[06:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23982.48s)]
*  There they are. Let's have a quick listen to this. [[06:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23988.48s)]
*  The band has performed in countless parades, community and sporting events, [[06:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=23996.48s)]
*  as well as competitions. [[06:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24013.48s)]
*  They have also always qualified for the Ohio Music Educators Association State Finals for 23 years. [[06:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24015.48s)]
*  This is the Middletown High School, of course, Middletown, Ohio, [[06:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24021.48s)]
*  where JD Vance has been living until he's about to move into the Naval Observatory later today. [[06:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24026.48s)]
*  As he's been taking part in all these ceremonies today, [[06:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24033.48s)]
*  his possessions will have been moved in to the Naval Observatory, [[06:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24036.48s)]
*  the official home of the US Vice President as Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff moved out with all of their belongings. [[06:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24039.48s)]
*  We were talking about that process this morning. [[06:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24045.48s)]
*  Let's have a little listen to this marching band from Middletown, Ohio, the high school there. [[06:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24048.48s)]
*  President Vance, they're taking their seats with one of JD Vance's children in front of them as this parade continues. [[06:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24108.48s)]
*  We're looking here at the cheerleaders and the marching band from the Middletown, Ohio, high school. [[06:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24115.48s)]
*  And we've seen many first responders there. [[06:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24122.48s)]
*  It is a long day for the little ones involved here, isn't it? [[06:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24124.48s)]
*  The two men there, the team who will be at the top of the US political system, [[06:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24129.48s)]
*  they're staging in conversation there with each other as they watch this parade here. [[06:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24135.48s)]
*  And of course, those who are gathered will be waiting to see just what's inside that folder [[06:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24140.48s)]
*  that we saw President Trump carry out onto the stage and he placed on the podium. [[06:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24146.48s)]
*  Beside that, there's a desk set up, almost like a mini resolute desk, the desk that's in the Oval Office. [[06:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24151.48s)]
*  There's a desk and a chair there ready for him to sign some paperwork a little bit later on in these proceedings. [[06:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24158.48s)]
*  And we've been speaking all day about how immigration is one of those big issues that Donald Trump has pledged to address on his first day in office. [[06:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24167.48s)]
*  And already there are major changes underway at the US-Mexico border. [[06:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24178.48s)]
*  I can tell you that the Trump administration has just shut down a phone app for migrants [[06:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24184.48s)]
*  and it has cancelled existing appointments for processing that had already been made with Border Patrol. [[06:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24190.48s)]
*  That Biden-era process had allowed nearly a million migrants to enter the US at legal border crossings. [[06:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24197.48s)]
*  They had to fill in the app in advance of traveling to the United States. [[06:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24204.48s)]
*  And today, during his inaugural address earlier, Donald Trump heaped criticism on the administration of his predecessor, Joe Biden. [[06:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24208.48s)]
*  We can see there a big cheer for JD Vance's hometown marching band, as we've been talking about there, Middleton, Ohio High School, the marching band. [[06:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24218.48s)]
*  There a big cheer for him. [[06:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24226.48s)]
*  Of course, this is about President Trump, but it's also about Vice President JD Vance. [[06:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24228.48s)]
*  And we heard in those remarks, we'll hear more remarks from President Trump shortly, but we've heard in the two sets of remarks earlier, [[06:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24233.48s)]
*  a lot of criticism leveled at Joe Biden and the outgoing administration. [[06:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24240.48s)]
*  Donald Trump saying that Joe Biden had spent unlimited funds on the defense of foreign borders while refusing to defend the borders of America. [[06:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24245.48s)]
*  We heard Donald Trump describe his intention to declare a national emergency in relation to the situation at the US-Mexico border and to deem drug cartels to consider them as terrorists. [[06:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24256.48s)]
*  Now, he may make those announcements official during the signing ceremony that's going to take place here at the Capital One Arena. [[06:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24268.48s)]
*  We'll wait to see what happens there. [[06:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24275.48s)]
*  So while we're keeping an eye on this parade ahead of those remarks from Donald Trump, I want to be joined now by our correspondent, Will Grant, who is in San Diego now. [[06:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24278.48s)]
*  Will, you are usually in Mexico, so you're very familiar with both sides of the border that we can see snaking there over your shoulder. [[06:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24290.48s)]
*  What's your view? [[06:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24299.48s)]
*  What's your understanding of what's been said today and what we might see happen? [[06:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24300.48s)]
*  Well, it was interesting, wasn't it? [[06:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24308.48s)]
*  We saw immediate implications of those policy announcements taking place on the Mexican side of the border. [[06:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24309.48s)]
*  What do I mean by that? [[06:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24316.48s)]
*  Well, that app that you mentioned, CBP One, through which migrants hoping to make their case for asylum in front of the US authorities, [[06:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24317.48s)]
*  they would make a date for that appointment. [[06:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24327.48s)]
*  That's a thousand people waiting on dates now scroll into that app and find a message waiting for them saying this is no longer valid. [[06:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24329.48s)]
*  Your appointment no longer exists. [[06:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24337.48s)]
*  Real desperation for those people, some of whom had dates today who were due to make their case in front of the authorities today. [[06:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24339.48s)]
*  And of course, many will have made huge journeys through the Americas, possibly even crossing the Darien Gap to get to that point, fleeing violence and so on. [[06:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24347.48s)]
*  So there are real time consequences for these policy decisions. [[06:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24356.48s)]
*  Other things we're waiting on, as you say, that may be signed in the coming minutes to do with that explanation that he said in his inaugural speech that he's going to declare and allowing him to deploy the military. [[06:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24360.48s)]
*  Again, a major step. [[06:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24371.48s)]
*  OK, well, thank you for that. [[06:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24377.48s)]
*  We'll wait to see what happens. [[06:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24379.48s)]
*  A lot of eyes on that decision. [[06:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24381.48s)]
*  And of course, it was very controversial during the campaign as to whether Donald Trump would use US military on domestic US shores. [[06:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24383.48s)]
*  And indeed, his defense secretary pick was questioned many times about it during his hearing last week as to whether if the president asked him as defense secretary to deploy US military within the bounds of the United States, would he say yes or no to that? [[06:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24392.48s)]
*  And he didn't give a direct answer to that, which was something that drew the ire of the Democratic colleagues who were addressing him and were questioning Pete Hegseth. [[06:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24408.48s)]
*  Let's go over to Sumi now while we keep an eye on the proceedings there in the Capital One Arena. [[06:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24418.48s)]
*  She is over near the White House. [[06:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24423.48s)]
*  Sumi. [[06:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24425.48s)]
*  That's right, Katrina. [[06:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24427.48s)]
*  We're watching these processions continue in the Capital One Arena. [[06:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24428.48s)]
*  This is the Florida firefighters pipes and drums from Boca Raton, Florida. [[06:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24431.48s)]
*  They are taking part in the ceremony today. [[06:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24436.48s)]
*  We saw Donald Trump rising out of a seat and pumping his fist in support of this band that is performing at the moment. [[06:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24438.48s)]
*  And of course, Donald Trump has adopted home is Florida. [[06:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24446.48s)]
*  So this in a way honoring Donald Trump's adopted home and his residence in Mar-a-Lago. [[06:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24448.48s)]
*  Now we were talking about immigration. [[06:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24453.48s)]
*  Let's continue that conversation now with John Fabricatori. [[06:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24455.48s)]
*  He's a retired ICE field director who's now a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation. [[06:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24458.48s)]
*  John, thank you so much for joining us. [[06:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24464.48s)]
*  And we're just keeping an eye, of course, on everything that's happening in Capital One Arena. [[06:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24466.48s)]
*  But I just want to get your take on some of these executive orders that we're expecting to see Donald Trump perhaps at that resolute desk recreation on the stage in Capital One Arena that he's expected to sign, in particular, these mass deportation orders. [[06:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24470.48s)]
*  Do you think this is something that President Trump is going to be able to enact right away? [[06:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24486.48s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[06:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24493.48s)]
*  You know, finally, the men and women of ICE are going to be able to do their job. [[06:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24494.48s)]
*  They're going to be able to follow the Immigration Nationality Act as it's written. [[06:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24497.48s)]
*  That is what President Trump promised. [[06:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24501.48s)]
*  And this mass immigration is just going to be going out after those illegal aliens who are in the community who need to be removed, especially those who have already seen an immigration judge and have a final order of removal. [[06:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24503.48s)]
*  There are over a million of those cases alone on the docket. [[06:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24515.48s)]
*  John, you know, when we did hear Donald Trump talk about immigration on the campaign trail, he talked about deporting 10 million, perhaps even more, what he called illegal aliens in the country. [[06:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24519.48s)]
*  That would be a far bigger operation, not the targeted operations that his borders are. [[06:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24534.48s)]
*  Tom Homan has talked about. [[06:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24540.48s)]
*  How do you see that discrepancy? [[06:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24542.48s)]
*  Well, there really isn't a discrepancy. [[06:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24545.48s)]
*  If you are illegally present in the country, you are not supposed to be here. [[06:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24547.48s)]
*  You did not come in through legal migration. [[06:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24551.48s)]
*  Those cases have to be dealt with at some point in time. [[06:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24553.48s)]
*  We either have an immigration policy or we don't. [[06:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24556.48s)]
*  And we do have an immigration policy and we will follow immigration law under Donald Trump. [[06:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24559.48s)]
*  So whether all those cases are brought in within the next four years or they are set up to see an immigration judge shortly, or they can decide to leave on their own. [[06:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24564.48s)]
*  But if you are present in the United States illegally, you entered counter to law. [[06:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24574.48s)]
*  But John, what about the migrants who live in the U.S., who have been here undocumented for decades, who have raised family here, who have jobs here? [[06:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24579.48s)]
*  Do you think that they should then be part of these raids? [[06:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24591.48s)]
*  They are counter to the immigration law. [[06:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24595.48s)]
*  They are present in the United States illegally. [[06:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24597.48s)]
*  Something has to be done about that. [[06:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24600.48s)]
*  They cannot continue to be in the shadows. [[06:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24602.48s)]
*  That's not to say that they're going to be deported. [[06:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24604.48s)]
*  They have to be in front of an immigration judge and have their case decided. [[06:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24607.48s)]
*  We cannot allow people to enter this country illegally and to continue to do it, to raise the number even more in the millions. [[06:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24611.48s)]
*  It needs to be dealt with and Donald Trump is going to deal with it according to the law. [[06:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24618.48s)]
*  When you say they need to be seen in front of a judge, one point that some critics have brought up is that there simply aren't the resources for Donald Trump's administration [[06:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24623.48s)]
*  and the authorities who would be responsible to carry out not only some of these deportation operations, but also with the massive backlog of cases that exist to actually go through the legal process. [[06:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24633.48s)]
*  So do we just say okay with these cases and throw our hands up in the air? [[06:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24644.48s)]
*  No, we develop resources. [[06:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24649.48s)]
*  We make sure those resources are put toward immigration. [[06:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24651.48s)]
*  If we're going to be serious about our immigration laws in this country, we need to be serious about the border and we need to be serious about what's in the interior of the United States. [[06:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24654.48s)]
*  These cases have to be brought to light at some point in time and I'm glad President Trump is now going to be able to do so. [[06:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24663.48s)]
*  All right, John, really interesting to get your perspective today. [[06:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24671.48s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[06:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24673.48s)]
*  Now we're just continuing to look at these images coming to us from the Capital One arena. [[06:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24680.48s)]
*  There you can see on the right hand side of your screen, President Trump, Vice President, JD Vance engaged in conversation as they're watching this parade of various people that have significant meaning to both of their lives marching through. [[06:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24686.48s)]
*  This parade, of course, would normally take place down Pennsylvania Avenue here behind us, but everything was moved inside because of the cold. [[06:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24700.48s)]
*  And I can tell you it's not as falling here. [[06:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24707.48s)]
*  It's getting colder and colder outside in Washington, D.C. [[06:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24709.48s)]
*  But I want to bring in as we are talking here about immigration and we are expecting that to be one of the focuses of the remarks that Donald Trump is going to make here at the Capital One arena and indeed. [[06:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24713.48s)]
*  Whatever he may sign at that desk that is set up on the stage. [[06:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24737.48s)]
*  So I want to bring in now Jason Hauser. [[06:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24740.48s)]
*  He is the former Joe Biden. [[06:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24742.48s)]
*  Thanks for being with us, Jason Hauser. [[06:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24744.48s)]
*  First, I just want to ask you on the remarks that we've heard from President Trump today, the inaugural address and those unscripted remarks. [[06:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24746.48s)]
*  He really went on the attack in terms of much of what the Biden administration had accomplished or as he sees it, didn't accomplish. [[06:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24754.48s)]
*  What was your view of when you were listening to that? [[06:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24762.48s)]
*  What were you thinking? [[06:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24765.48s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[06:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24767.48s)]
*  You know, my first thoughts were there was unequivocal agreement across party lines, affiliation, even with your previous guests, that the United States immigration system is broken. [[06:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24768.48s)]
*  There's about 14 million non-citizens and migrants on the immigration docket. [[06:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24778.48s)]
*  And the system's really built to handle probably 2 million. [[06:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24784.48s)]
*  It's been broken for decades. [[06:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24788.48s)]
*  Again, the immigration system, you know, begins south of the southern border and as people come to the border and seek asylum and then they work for the asylum process and they go in front of judges. [[06:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24790.48s)]
*  And then they hear a decision and they're either given a pathway or they're not and then they either are resettled in the communities and our system has become overwhelmed. [[06:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24801.48s)]
*  Well, what I don't hear, what I did not hear today is people wanting to address the overall system itself, even as your previous guest pointed out. [[06:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24810.48s)]
*  There is not enough immigration judges. There is not enough resettlement services. [[06:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24819.48s)]
*  We are continuing to need to continue to expand our border security and our enforcement and our case management. [[06:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24825.48s)]
*  But what I heard today was a lot of focus on the very, very few minimal, you know, there's a small number of individuals that try to enter our immigration system and take advantage of it. [[06:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24831.48s)]
*  So I look for everybody. There's criminal elements, drug traffickers. [[06:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24842.48s)]
*  We need ICE and we need immigration enforcement focused on those threats to our communities and not sort of, you know, choking out the ability for migrants that are fleeing in sometimes horrific situations across the Western Hemisphere and across the globe. [[06:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24845.48s)]
*  So exercising the law, our laws, our immigration, which are coming to this country. We need to create pathways, but we need a system that works. [[06:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24860.48s)]
*  And I didn't hear a lot about that today. What I heard today is just to jump in there Jason, just on that point. Sorry. [[06:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24869.48s)]
*  I think there's a delay on the line, Jason, just to jump in there because we have been speaking to members of both parties through the day. [[06:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24877.48s)]
*  And there is, as you say, that broad agreement that immigration reform, which hasn't been reformed in this country for decades now, does need to be addressed, although successive Congresses have failed to be able to do that. [[06:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24884.48s)]
*  But I just want to ask you about some of the points you mentioned there, in particular, there not being enough immigration judges, border patrol agents and so on. [[06:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24896.48s)]
*  If President Trump were to take actions now or try to divert a lot more funding to some of those things you've mentioned, what would be the kind of timeline for that? [[06:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24904.48s)]
*  Is that within his gift, first of all? And if so, how quickly could that all be scaled up? [[06:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24915.48s)]
*  So, I mean, he could ramp up tension and more enforcement, pulling resources from other federal law enforcement agencies, rely upon more state and local law enforcement and really expand the sort of enterprise itself. [[06:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24921.48s)]
*  But, of course, as you know, all federal law enforcement have critical national security and public safety missions. [[06:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24933.48s)]
*  If all of a sudden you take officers from one branch of the government that may be looking at human smuggling or sex trafficking or drug smuggling, and you now have them out arresting non-criminal, non-public safety threats, [[06:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24939.48s)]
*  and the dyes of just enforcement for enforcement's sake, we have to ask ourselves, does that make us more safe or less safe? [[06:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24951.48s)]
*  As you mentioned earlier, a lot of these migrants, based on the sort of the a lot of migrants have been here for decades, thriving, small business owners, leaders in our community, right? [[06:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24958.48s)]
*  These are families. They've been here for a long time. [[06:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24969.48s)]
*  Immigration enforcement should be focused on those national security and public safety threats, on individuals that are here to cause us harm, not on people that are here thriving or are the backbone of our communities. [[06:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24972.48s)]
*  And we often hear, Jason, about how difficult it is for obvious reasons to track the number of people who are in the United States without the correct paperwork. [[06:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24984.48s)]
*  How would you even go about trying to normalize the situation for those people when there is going to be an understandable fear about putting themselves forward and contacting authorities, even if it is with the view to having a regularized situation? [[06:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=24994.48s)]
*  Immigration enforcement and oversight is a partnership. It's a partnership and there's responsibility both on the side of the migrant and also on the side of law enforcement. [[06:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25010.48s)]
*  And when you see actions that are just sort of punitive or sort of arresting migrants that are non-public safety threats and putting them in detention during check-ins or targeting them in sensitive locations like at courthouses or hospitals, that can cause a massive chilling effect. [[06:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25020.48s)]
*  If you bring state and local law enforcement and other federal law enforcement partners into that same work, those agencies could also be targeted and see their work as they sort of work and partner with communities. [[06:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25036.48s)]
*  But even today, as you mentioned earlier, the sort of pathway programs have already been turned off today. [[06:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25051.48s)]
*  That was a law enforcement program that allowed individuals seeking asylum under the law to be pre-checked and screened and vetted. [[06:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25058.48s)]
*  That allowed law enforcement on the borders to focus on the national security and public safety threats and provide the humane, orderly pathway for migrants to come to the country. [[06:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25067.48s)]
*  Like turning that off, you potentially risk pushing those migrants back into the deserts of West Texas and putting more burden on Border Patrol to sort of sift through migrants as they come to the border. [[06:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25076.48s)]
*  Instead of having those Border Patrol agents, you see these individual targeted policies that have ripple effects across law enforcement and there needs to be a more holistic look as these things are implemented. [[06:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25089.48s)]
*  Okay, well, we'll wait to see, I suppose, what else is in that package of moves and actions that we are expecting from President Trump today. [[06:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25105.48s)]
*  For the moment, Jason Hauser, former ICE Chief Under President Biden, thanks so much for joining us here on BBC News with that insight and analysis. [[06:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25115.48s)]
*  Now, while we've been chatting there, we are looking at these images of the Capital One arena, this parade happening indoors ahead of those remarks from President Trump. [[06:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25124.48s)]
*  Just want to get a very quick thought from Congressman Jake La Turner, former Congressman from Kansas. [[06:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25136.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25244.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25274.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25304.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25334.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25364.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25394.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25404.48s)]
*  If you were counting close to 300 from the Mississippi Valley State University band. [[07:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25409.48s)]
*  You know, since its founding, the band has consistently played a significant role at their university and across the United States. [[07:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25420.48s)]
*  They have performed for athletic events, Mardi Gras parades, Rose Bowl parades, and many, many more. [[07:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25426.48s)]
*  The Mississippi Valley State University band takes great pride in presenting culturally diverse presentations for students, faculty and the surrounding Mississippi communities. [[07:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25432.48s)]
*  Take a look at that brass out there. [[07:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25443.48s)]
*  That's just part of a big green marching machine. [[07:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25448.48s)]
*  The main green marching machine from Mississippi, ladies and gentlemen. [[07:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25455.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25485.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25502.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25527.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25549.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25571.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25593.48s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our new special envoy to the Middle East. [[07:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25615.48s)]
*  Steve with golf. [[07:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25631.48s)]
*  Good evening, everybody. [[07:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25658.48s)]
*  I am. [[07:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25661.48s)]
*  I was appointed by President Trump to be the special envoy for peace in the Middle East. [[07:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25663.48s)]
*  I would like to describe to you some of the things we're doing and how it informs on President Trump's policies. [[07:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25680.48s)]
*  First of all, it is an honor to stand before you today. [[07:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25689.48s)]
*  As I reflect on the enormity of the role that President Trump has tasked me with, I am constantly reminded of the privilege it is to serve under the leadership of my boss, President Donald J. [[07:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25693.48s)]
*  Trump. [[07:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25706.48s)]
*  His presidency has provided a clear, bold vision for the Middle East, and it is this vision that guides every step I take in the mission. [[07:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25715.48s)]
*  President Trump's leadership has redefined what is possible in the pursuit of progress and stability in the Middle East. [[07:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25726.48s)]
*  His decisive pragmatic pragmatic approach ensures that even the most entrenched conflicts are met with fresh perspectives and innovative strategies. [[07:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25735.48s)]
*  His policies have already delivered remarkable successes, such as yesterday's release of hostages in Gaza. [[07:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25748.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25766.48s)]
*  This achievement demonstrates the strength of President Trump's leadership and the respect he commands on the global stage. [[07:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25771.48s)]
*  It is yet another example of his ability to deliver results in the most complex and challenging situations. [[07:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25780.48s)]
*  The Abraham Accords, a testament to his vision and determination, have also brought historic progress to the region, transforming old rivalries into new alliances. [[07:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25789.48s)]
*  These agreements are not merely symbolic. [[07:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25803.48s)]
*  They represent a practical roadmap for peace, economic cooperation, and mutual respect across nations. [[07:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25806.48s)]
*  My role, as President Trump has tasked me, is straightforward yet profoundly challenging. [[07:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25816.48s)]
*  To turn his vision into actionable outcomes. [[07:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25823.48s)]
*  He sets the agenda. [[07:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25827.48s)]
*  He lays the framework. [[07:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25829.48s)]
*  And he inspires people like me into bold action. [[07:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25831.48s)]
*  My responsibility is to implement his vision, engaging with leaders across the region to find pathways towards sustainable peace and stability. [[07:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25836.48s)]
*  And let me tell you, having Donald Trump as a boss makes this task not only possible, but far more effective. [[07:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25847.48s)]
*  President Trump's reputation as a leader who delivers results resonates far beyond Washington. [[07:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25865.48s)]
*  Leaders in the Middle East know he means what he says. [[07:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25874.48s)]
*  His ability to cut through bureaucratic gridlock and focus on tangible results is the game changer. [[07:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25878.48s)]
*  It allows me to approach delicate negotiations with the confidence that the full weight of the United States is behind me. [[07:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25886.48s)]
*  The principles President Trump has laid out for our approach to the Middle East and foreign policy in general are fourfold and they are clear. [[07:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25895.48s)]
*  One, respect for sovereignty. [[07:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25906.48s)]
*  Every nation deserves the right to determine its own destiny free from the interference of external powers. [[07:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25910.48s)]
*  Two, economic prosperity as a bridge to stability. [[07:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25919.48s)]
*  Through economic partnerships and investment, we can build a foundation for cooperation that transcends historical grievances. [[07:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25924.48s)]
*  Three, courageous diplomacy. [[07:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25934.48s)]
*  Real progress requires difficult conversations and bold decisions. [[07:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25938.48s)]
*  And it is through these that trust is built and maintained. [[07:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25944.48s)]
*  And finally, four, reciprocity and accountability. [[07:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25950.48s)]
*  The United States requires reciprocal actions from our partners. [[07:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25955.48s)]
*  We are done carrying the financial burden for nations that are unwilling. [[07:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25961.48s)]
*  We are done carrying the financial burden for nations that are unwilling to fund their own progress. [[07:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25967.48s)]
*  The days of blank checks are over. [[07:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=25991.48s)]
*  Partnerships under President Trump's leadership must be equitable and contributions must reflect shared commitments to our goals. [[07:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26002.48s)]
*  In my work, I've seen firsthand how these principles resonate. [[07:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26014.48s)]
*  They provide a foundation that transcends politics and speaks to the shared humanity of all people in a region. [[07:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26019.48s)]
*  Leaders across the Middle East recognized that this Trump administration is serious about results, not symbolic gestures, but real, meaningful progress that improves lives. [[07:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26028.48s)]
*  It's not always easy. [[07:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26043.48s)]
*  There are moments of deep challenge and frustration. [[07:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26053.48s)]
*  Decades of mistrust cannot be undone overnight. [[07:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26056.48s)]
*  Yet I take comfort in knowing that I am not in this alone. [[07:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26061.48s)]
*  President Trump's clarity of vision ensures that I never have to question what success looks like. [[07:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26065.48s)]
*  His leadership provides the confidence and direction necessary to navigate these complexities. [[07:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26072.48s)]
*  As we move forward, my commitment is to continue the work of advancing President Trump's vision for the Middle East. [[07:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26079.48s)]
*  Whether through expanding the Abraham Peace Accords, fostering economic development, or facilitating dialogue between long-standing adversaries, [[07:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26087.48s)]
*  my focus remains on actionable results. [[07:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26098.48s)]
*  Let me close by saying this. [[07:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26102.48s)]
*  A stable and prosperous Middle East is not an unattainable dream. [[07:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26105.48s)]
*  It is a goal within our reach made possible by strong leadership and unwavering commitment. [[07:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26111.48s)]
*  Under President Trump's guidance, we are proving that the impossible can become reality. [[07:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26122.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26128.48s)]
*  But I have one more thing to say. [[07:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26130.48s)]
*  We have some special people for me to introduce you to tonight. [[07:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26133.48s)]
*  President Trump has been talking to them as well. [[07:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26139.48s)]
*  They are the families of hostages from Israel who have been in Gaza for the last year and a half. [[07:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26142.48s)]
*  There are many of them here today. [[07:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26151.48s)]
*  Several of the families have lost children and loved ones. [[07:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26154.48s)]
*  And they're here because they're part of an effort to retrieve their bodies so they can be buried in a proper way. [[07:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26158.48s)]
*  Several have children who are still in captivity. [[07:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26166.48s)]
*  There is an American family here whose loved one is scheduled to come out in 14 days. [[07:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26170.48s)]
*  And they're going to be meeting the president tonight. [[07:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26178.48s)]
*  So let's give them all some love and a big hand. [[07:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26180.48s)]

*  We won, we won, but now the work begins. [[07:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26391.36s)]
*  We have to bring them home. [[07:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26393.92s)]
*  And, you know, tonight I'm going to be signing on the J6 hostages' pardons to get them out. [[07:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26395.88s)]
*  And as soon as I leave, I'm going to the Oval Office and we'll be signing pardons for a [[07:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26410.0s)]

*  And that's what we need. [[07:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26434.16s)]
*  We don't need stiffs. [[07:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26435.16s)]
*  We don't need stiffs. [[07:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26436.16s)]
*  We got a lot of stiffs. [[07:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26437.16s)]
*  You just had, you just had a whole load of them. [[07:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26438.16s)]
*  And to the former hostages with us today, welcome. [[07:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26444.36s)]
*  Welcome home. [[07:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26448.48s)]
*  Some of the folks are former hostages. [[07:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26449.48s)]
*  Not a good situation. [[07:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26452.52s)]
*  The three young ladies that came home yesterday, you saw that. [[07:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26453.8s)]
*  More coming home every day now. [[07:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26458.88s)]
*  They're coming home. [[07:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26460.28s)]
*  But they were hurt. [[07:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26461.28s)]
*  They were hurt. [[07:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26463.8s)]
*  They were hurt. [[07:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26465.4s)]
*  One had her head blown off, fingers on her hand, and her hand indeed was blown off. [[07:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26467.9s)]
*  She was trying to defend herself from a bullet being fired. [[07:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26474.559999999998s)]
*  You believe this? [[07:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26477.559999999998s)]
*  A bullet knocked off her hand. [[07:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26478.559999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[07:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26480.88s)]
*  You look at it, it's a disgrace. [[07:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26482.84s)]
*  We never stopped praying for you, and we're so glad that you're reunited with your friends [[07:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26484.44s)]

*  And God bless you all. [[07:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26491.399999999998s)]
*  And some of them are just saying, no, my son is gone. [[07:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26492.52s)]
*  But please just bring home his body. [[07:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26497.64s)]
*  Right, Steve? [[07:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26499.36s)]
*  Many of you have told me that. [[07:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26500.88s)]
*  That your son is gone, but bring home his body. [[07:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26503.12s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[07:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26505.96s)]
*  Three years, it's ridiculous. [[07:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26509.12s)]
*  Should have never happened. [[07:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26511.28s)]

*  I grew up with New York's finest. [[07:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26565.24s)]
*  And we've got to give them their authority back. [[07:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26567.36s)]
*  You won't have any crime. [[07:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26570.64s)]
*  There'll be no crime. [[07:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26572.0s)]
*  You give them little authority back. [[07:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26573.6s)]
*  The whole way they run things in this country now, it's disgraceful. [[07:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26576.6s)]
*  But it's going to change rapidly. [[07:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26581.44s)]
*  We're going to make our cities safe again, too. [[07:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26582.88s)]
*  Even though we're indoors, we've had a magnificent inaugural parade. [[07:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26585.9s)]
*  And let's give a big round of applause. [[07:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26590.84s)]

*  How good is JD? [[07:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26641.46s)]
*  JD has been great. [[07:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26644.260000000002s)]
*  He's another good negotiator, Steve. [[07:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26646.54s)]
*  He's a great negotiator, too. [[07:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26648.58s)]
*  We need negotiators in this country. [[07:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26650.66s)]
*  But so many of the people on the stage, we had not only family members as an example. [[07:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26654.3s)]
*  Lara Trump, the wife of Eric. [[07:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26659.3s)]
*  She was the head of the Republican Party, along with my friend Michael Standup, the [[07:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26662.54s)]

*  What a job they did. [[07:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26671.260000000002s)]
*  They worked so hard. [[07:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26675.58s)]
*  They knew they'd be rigging, but they said we're going to make it too big to rig. [[07:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26677.02s)]
*  And we did. [[07:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26680.620000000003s)]
*  We made it too big to rig. [[07:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26681.620000000003s)]
*  We won every swing state by a lot. [[07:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26684.24s)]
*  We won the popular vote by millions and millions of votes. [[07:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26688.24s)]

*  And how about Lutnick, Secretary of Commerce? [[07:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26922.18s)]
*  He's going to take in more money than any country has ever even thought about. [[07:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26926.18s)]
*  He's going to take in some money. [[07:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26934.18s)]
*  And we have many others. [[07:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26937.18s)]
*  Look, I'm not going to go through it. [[07:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26938.18s)]
*  But we're going to sign some orders right now. [[07:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26939.18s)]
*  And that's really what I want to do. [[07:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26941.18s)]
*  So we're going to sign executive orders first. [[07:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26946.18s)]
*  First, I'll revoke nearly 80 destructive and radical executive actions of the previous [[07:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26948.18s)]
*  administration, one of the worst administrations in history. [[07:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26954.18s)]
*  Maybe the worst. [[07:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26957.18s)]
*  Not one of them. [[07:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26958.18s)]
*  The worst. [[07:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26959.18s)]
*  Anybody that would allow millions of people to pour through our borders from jails, prisons, [[07:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26960.18s)]
*  mental institutions, insane asylums, gang members to be taken off the streets of Venezuela [[07:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26967.18s)]
*  and deposit in our country. [[07:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26974.18s)]
*  And many, not just Venezuelans. [[07:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26977.18s)]
*  You know, crime in Venezuela is down 74 percent because they took their criminals and gave [[07:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26978.18s)]
*  them to us through an open border policy of the previous administration. [[07:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26984.18s)]
*  All over the world, they're emptying their prisons into our country. [[07:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26992.18s)]
*  They're emptying their mental institutions into our country. [[07:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=26997.18s)]
*  It stops as of one o'clock this afternoon. [[07:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27001.18s)]
*  Okay? [[07:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27005.18s)]
*  It stops. [[07:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27006.18s)]
*  So I'm revoking nearly 80 destructive, radical executive actions of the previous administration. [[07:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27013.18s)]
*  They'll all be null and void within about, what, five minutes? [[07:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27020.18s)]
*  Is that them over there? [[07:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27023.18s)]
*  Five minutes? [[07:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27025.18s)]
*  And next, again, immediate control of the vast federal out-of-control bureaucracy. [[07:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27027.18s)]
*  I will implement an immediate regulation freeze, which will stop Biden bureaucrats from continuing [[07:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27033.18s)]
*  to regulate. [[07:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27040.18s)]
*  Most of those bureaucrats are being fired. [[07:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l_F4Y9QE9o&t=27041.18s)]
