Video Description: UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet in Downing Street on Saturday afternoon, Downing Street has said.
 
Zelensky arrived at Stansted Airport earlier today in the wake of a White House meeting with US President Donald Trump on Friday, that descended into a row between the two leaders over the war in Ukraine.
 
It comes a day before Starmer hosts a summit of European leaders to discuss bringing the war between Ukraine and Russia to an end, as well as wider European defence.
 
That meeting will now be overshadowed by recent events in Washington and concerns about a hardening of relations with the US.

*  President Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of gambling with World War III [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=28.2s)]
*  and have not been grateful for the support of the US. President Zelensky [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=32.48s)]
*  made it clear there should be no compromises with President Putin. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=37.28s)]
*  Following those exchanges the President of Ukraine was ordered to leave the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=41.96s)]
*  White House. The American minerals deal was not signed. US President later said [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=46.36s)]

*  this morning ahead of a meeting with the Prime Minister and European leaders [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=62.4s)]
*  hoping perhaps for a warmer welcome than the intemperate shouting match he got at [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=66.08s)]
*  the White House. In extraordinary furious exchanges Donald Trump and his number two [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  angrily railed at Ukraine's president accusing him of being disrespectful for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=77.08s)]
*  resisting a ceasefire deal without security guarantees. Mr. President with [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=82.64s)]
*  respect I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=87.68s)]
*  to litigate this in front of the American media. Don't tell us what we're [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  gonna feel we're trying to solve a problem don't tell us what we're gonna [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=93.88s)]
*  feel. I'm not telling you. Because you're in no position to dictate that. Remember that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=97.4s)]
*  You're in no position to dictate what we're gonna feel. It was rude it was [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=101.36s)]
*  brutal and unrelenting but was it deliberate? You're right now not in a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=108.24s)]
*  very good position. They accused him of being ungrateful for US support. Have you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=113.32s)]
*  said thank you once? No in this entire meeting you said thank you. You went to Pennsylvania and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=119.19999999999999s)]

*  country. And with that Ukraine's president was shown the White House door [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=134.6s)]
*  with no press conference no minerals deal and something more than a flea in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=139.16s)]
*  his ear. In Russia the exchanges were played out in full the news presenters [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=143.64s)]
*  talking of a diplomatic train wreck and public political execution. No word yet [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=151.04s)]
*  from President Putin who may have enjoyed what Mr. Trump called great [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=156.48s)]
*  television. The row made headlines too across Europe whose leaders will gather [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=160.64s)]

*  everyone saying simply thank you for your support. Is that support enough? As [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=183.16s)]
*  the war continues Russian drones striking a hospital overnight in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=190.12s)]
*  Kharkiv Ukraine and Europe now face a tough question. How long could they [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=194.24s)]
*  resist Russian forces if Donald Trump pulled the plug on US military aid? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=199.84s)]
*  James Landell BBC News. Well as we mentioned President Zelensky is meeting [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=205.12s)]
*  Kirstama ahead of tomorrow's summit in London. Let's bring in our political [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=211.72s)]
*  correspondent Helen Katz. Just a few hours away this meeting in Downing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=216.12s)]
*  Street between the two men. What's the significance of it now? This is going to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=221.08s)]
*  be a very tense, delicate situation diplomatically this weekend. It has [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=225.24s)]
*  always been the case that Vladimir Zelensky was supposed to have a meeting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=231.72s)]
*  with Kirstama. It's the UK that has convened this summit that you heard [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=235.4s)]
*  James talking about of European leaders. It's happening tomorrow. Vladimir Zelensky [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=238.88s)]
*  was always coming and there was always an intention that he was going to have a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=242.36s)]
*  one-on-one meeting in Downing Street with Sir Kirstama. But obviously since [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=245.08s)]
*  the the events of yesterday and what we saw in the Oval Office that will have [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=249.96s)]
*  very much changed the conversation and the tone of this whole weekend. And it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  also does actually really put the spotlight on the UK. You know Vladimir [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=258.2s)]
*  Zelensky is here on British soil now it's very much Kirstama's hot potato to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  handle this weekend. And this meeting that we're going to see in a few hours [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=266.32s)]
*  time at Downing Street, obviously it's going to be very different in tone to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=271.16s)]
*  the meeting and the pictures we're seeing here in in the White House. Do we [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=276.36s)]
*  have any sense of what the two men will be discussing? What points Kirstama will [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=280.12s)]
*  want to be emphasizing to the leader of Ukraine? So we don't to be honest. We [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  don't know what they're going to talk about apart from we know that it's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=290.04s)]
*  obviously going to be around support for Ukraine and Kirstama has mentioned his [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=292.92s)]
*  unwavering support as he puts it for Ukraine and how to improve their [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=297.64s)]
*  position. I think what's interesting though is that Vladimir Zelensky since he [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  landed President Zelensky has this afternoon put out a series of posts on [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  social media in which he does talk about being truly thankful for US support and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=309.12s)]
*  says that it is crucial that he has US support. But he reiterates this core [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=313.32s)]
*  point where there is a bit of division which is that he is saying that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=316.76s)]
*  that he will not sign up to a ceasefire if there are no security guarantees and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=322.36s)]
*  he wants those backed by the US whereas President Trump sees it the other way [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=327.24s)]
*  round and in recent days Kirstama has been more echoing the Trump view that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=330.76s)]
*  you can have a ceasefire first and then put the security guarantees in later. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  We'll have to see whether that is still his position when he meets Zelensky later [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=338.68s)]
*  or what comes out of that because that is the sort of the heart of this that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  where there is that real division or difference in opinion. Okay let's look [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  ahead to the summit in a bit more detail tomorrow. Clearly agendas top of the list. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=349.64s)]
*  Things will have been ripped up and rewritten now. What should we be looking [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=356.12s)]
*  out for at the end of this summit tomorrow? Well there is going to be pressure for [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=360.52s)]
*  something to come out of this summit because having sort of spoken to people [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=365.56s)]
*  over the weekend it's not entirely clear that there is what the end result would [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=370.2s)]
*  be after. It's not like for example when you have a formalized summit and there's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=374.76s)]
*  going to be an agreed communique or something like that at the end of it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=377.8s)]
*  I'm not sure that there was a necessarily that sort of thing envisaged from it but [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=380.44s)]
*  the point of it is to drive forward Downing Street has said the European [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=384.52s)]
*  efforts towards getting towards a lasting peace deal and we know that they're going [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  to talk about things like ongoing military support and things like sanctions on Russia. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=394.35999999999996s)]
*  The context though in which they're having these discussions is completely different [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  from what they were expecting. There's been this very carefully choreographed week from [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=402.84s)]
*  Downing Street where you had the UK announcing it was going to raise its defence spending [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=407.24s)]
*  earlier in the week then that visit to Washington from Sikorsky-Stammer on Thursday which went [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=411.32s)]
*  very well with Donald Trump. The expectation was they'd be going into this this weekend [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=415.48s)]
*  with the US brought a little bit further onside having signed a minerals deal with Ukraine, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=419.88s)]
*  having met Zelensky in the White House and that having gone well obviously that is very [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=425.88s)]
*  much not the case and so now what they're looking at is talking about European contributions and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=430.76s)]
*  European support but in the context of far shakier American support and that's quite a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=436.28s)]
*  different context to be discussing so I think there will be increased scrutiny on what does [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  come out of that meeting tomorrow you know what can the Europeans alone offer towards this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bd1Aro72Gg&t=446.11999999999995s)]
