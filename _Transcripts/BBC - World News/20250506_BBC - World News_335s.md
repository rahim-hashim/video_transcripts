Video Description: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to meet US President Donald Trump in his first official visit to the White House.
 
Relations between the two countries remain frayed over President Trump's tariffs and threats to make Canada the 51st US state - which Carney has said will "never ever happen".
 
In a post-election news conference on Friday, Carney said he intends to discuss tariffs and broader US-Canada relations with Trump during their meeting.
 
The US president announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico in February, claiming this was to stop fentanyl and migrant trafficking, but there have been several delays and exemptions since.

# Canadian PM Carney to meet Trump for first time to discuss tariffs | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I)
*  Back now to US politics and we've already heard that the newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is meeting President Trump today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=0.0s)]
*  It's barely been a week since he was unexpectedly elected. So what can we expect from his visit to the US? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=8.0s)]
*  Let's speak to political reporter at the National Review Audrey Fullbrook who's in Washington for us. Audrey, good to have you with us today on BBC News. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=16.0s)]
*  Yes, so many people both sides of the border there and elsewhere will be looking on seeing what emerges from this meeting between the two men. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=24.0s)]
*  What do you think we should be looking out for? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=33.0s)]
*  Well, it's anyone's guess how this meeting will go. Trump has, of course, sounded a slightly positive note about Carney thus far calling him a quote, very nice gentleman and a very nice man. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=35.0s)]
*  But he's also struck quite an indifferent tone joking that I'm not sure what he wants to see me about. I guess he wants to make a deal. Everybody does. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=46.0s)]
*  The stakes are very high for Carney here because he, of course, you know, rode the anti-Trump wave to, as you said, an unexpected victory. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=56.0s)]
*  So his supporters are going to be watching very closely. And this, of course, comes weeks after the Zelensky blow up in the Oval Office. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=65.0s)]
*  So Canadians are a little bit nervous because if this goes wrong, that could hurt their relationship for months or perhaps years to come. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=71.0s)]
*  So expect lots of talk about defense and tariffs, of course, as well. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=78.0s)]
*  And this comes as world leaders across the globe are begging for face time with President Trump amid this trade war. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=83.0s)]
*  As we slowly approach the 90 day pause on reciprocal tariffs, that deadline that is that is coming up where where countries could see a big swing toward reciprocal tariffs yet again. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=90.0s)]
*  And then, Audrey, we're going to talk about Mike Pence next, of course, President Trump's vice president during his first term in office. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=102.0s)]
*  And we'll bring you a clip just before we get into that discussion, Audrey and myself. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=111.0s)]
*  But Mike Pence has criticized the president over tariffs, Russia and the January 6th pardons. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=115.0s)]
*  And in an interview with CNN, the former vice president said that America's wavering support for Ukraine has emboldened Russia. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=122.0s)]
*  I really believe that Putin only understands power. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=129.0s)]
*  And it's the reason why in this moment we need to make it clear that the United States is going to continue to lead the free world to provide Ukraine with the military support they need to repel the Russian invasion and achieve a just and lasting peace. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=133.0s)]
*  The wavering support the administration has shown over the last few months, I believe, has only emboldened Russia. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=151.0s)]
*  Audrey, how do you think those comments from Mike Pence are landing? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=159.0s)]
*  Well, it's important to remember that given Mike Pence challenged his former boss for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, he's widely considered persona non grata in Republican circles in Washington, though, of course, you know, his decision to to to stand by the election results in in 2020 has has given him new respect among Democrats in Washington. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=164.0s)]
*  But on the 2024 campaign trail, he also you just mentioned those comments just now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=189.0s)]
*  He also, you know, criticized strongly Trump on trade abortion policy and defense on the campaign trail as well on trade in particular. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=194.0s)]
*  Expect him to continue those criticisms. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=206.0s)]
*  You know, he's talked constantly in recent weeks about how during the first Trump administration, the Pence and Trump had a much more free trade outlook. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=210.0s)]
*  That's, of course, because there were a lot more free trade restrainer types who was strained Trump from his more tariff impulses that first go around. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=218.0s)]
*  So expect to see a lot more criticism from Pence over the coming weeks on this, not just on those issues, but also Trump has signed so many executive orders this time around. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=229.0s)]
*  Really testing the bounds of presidential power, which is not particularly popular among traditional Republican types like Mike Pence. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=239.0s)]
*  So I'd expect to see him to continue to criticize his former boss on that as well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=246.0s)]
*  In addition to defense and Audrey, let's also talk about the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=250.0s)]
*  It's reported he has directed the U.S. military to reduce the number of four star generals by 20 percent in a memo seen by U.S. media. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=256.0s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth said the cuts would remove what he called a redundant military structure and streamline its leadership. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=264.0s)]
*  So, Audrey, what sort of reaction is there there in the states to to this news? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=271.0s)]
*  Democrats are definitely stunned by this news. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=276.0s)]
*  Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said that there shouldn't be arbitrary percentages when it comes to really big cuts like this at the Pentagon. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=279.0s)]
*  But this isn't a particular this is not a particularly surprising move from Hegseth. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=292.0s)]
*  He spent his first few months on the job criticizing the Pentagon for administrative and bureaucratic bloat. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=297.0s)]
*  He says that there's an inverse relationship between the size and scope of the Pentagon and staff and victory on the battlefield. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=303.0s)]
*  So this is not a surprising move. I'd expect to see even down the line. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=313.0s)]
*  If he hangs on to his job after the signal debacle to continue advocating for these across the board cuts. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=316.0s)]
*  But it is definitely a big deal in Washington and Republicans and Democrats will continue to be watching this very closely. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=323.0s)]
*  OK, Audrey, thank you very much for that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=330.0s)]
*  Audrey Folberg from the National Review there in Washington. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kGRMglw-I&t=332.0s)]
