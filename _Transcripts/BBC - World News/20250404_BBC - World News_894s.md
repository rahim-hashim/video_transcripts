China - which faces a 54% import tax - said it would retaliate with an additional 34% tax on American goods from 10 April, prompting a further fall in European markets.
 
Indexes in the UK, Germany and France have all dropped down by more than 3%. Asian markets also dropped earlier.

# US markets tumble as President Trump says China 'played it wrong' in tariffs retaliation | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc)
*  The shockwaves are still coming after Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs on all imports into the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=0.0s)]
*  China has hit back today announcing an extra 34% tax on all American goods being sold there. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=7.04s)]
*  They've accused the US of bullying and endangering the global trade order, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=14.0s)]
*  and in the last few minutes Donald Trump has accused China of panicking in their response. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=18.72s)]
*  Then there's the rout on the markets. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=24.32s)]
*  Well that was the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones down nearly 3%. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=30.56s)]
*  Stock markets around the world have been in freefall since the tariffs were announced. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=35.92s)]
*  Meanwhile the UK Prime Minister is expected to hold calls with international leaders this weekend. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  It's understood the conversations are likely to be with European and Commonwealth leaders, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=46.64s)]
*  with no call to Donald Trump currently anticipated. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=51.6s)]
*  So let's start this hour with this report from our business correspondent Mark Ashdown. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=55.36s)]
*  Just a day after President Trump's announcement, China has hit back. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  From next Thursday sweeping tariffs of 34% on all US goods being imported into the country, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=63.92s)]
*  from machinery and electronics to oil and vehicles. This global trade war just escalated. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=70.72s)]
*  It follows nervous smiles at the closing bell on Wall Street last night. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=79.6s)]
*  Trillions of dollars wiped off the value of US stocks, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=83.6s)]
*  as the major indices suffered their biggest one-day falls for five years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=86.56s)]
*  Household names like Nike, Amazon and Apple saw their values plummet. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=91.04s)]
*  This was how the global financial markets reacted to Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=95.68s)]
*  Asian and European stocks followed down across the board, as fears of a worldwide recession took hold. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=100.64s)]
*  The President insisted however everything was going to plan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=109.68s)]
*  The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=113.2s)]
*  and the rest of the world wants to see is there any way they can make a deal. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=117.28s)]
*  Are you happy with the tariffs, Sakhir? Are you going to get a deal before tomorrow? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=121.04s)]
*  No comment from the Prime Minister this morning. The government maintains any response will be calm [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  and measured. Although it has now drawn up a 400-page list of US products, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=130.88s)]
*  the UK could hit with tariffs of its own. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=135.84s)]
*  Well of course we don't want to see tariffs on UK exports and we're working hard as a government [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=139.28s)]
*  in discussion with our counterparts in the US to represent the British national interest and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=146.72s)]
*  support British jobs and British industry. Those conversations are ongoing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=151.44s)]
*  Every country, including the UK, has been hit with a baseline tariff of 10% on all goods being [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=157.12s)]
*  exported to the US. EU member countries are facing double that, a tariff of 20%. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=163.2s)]
*  Goods being exported from Japan will be subject to a 24% tariff. The highest rate is being applied [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  to China at 54%. European stocks have continued to slide in response but the US Secretary of State [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Marco Rubio, taking part in the NATO summit this morning, said the pain would be short-term. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  Businesses around the world, including in trade and global trade, they just need to know what the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=189.68s)]
*  rules are. Once they know what the rules are, they will adjust to those rules. So I don't think it's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=193.84s)]
*  fair to say economies are crashing, markets are crashing because markets are based on the stock [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  value of companies who today are embedded in modes of production that are bad for the United States. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=202.32s)]
*  As well as announcing tariffs, China has also filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=208.8s)]
*  claiming the US tariffs had tantamount to bullying and seriously violate international rules. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=214.0s)]
*  This trade war is fast moving, the outcome increasingly difficult to predict. Mark Ashdown, BBC News. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=219.44s)]
*  Well let's get more on the Chinese reaction we've seen through the course of today. Here's our [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=227.28s)]
*  correspondent Steve McDonnell, he's in Beijing for us. Well this is disastrous news for any [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  US company that wants to sell into the huge Chinese market. It's even worse for agricultural [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=236.96s)]
*  producers. They already had a 10 or 15 percent tariff on them following Donald Trump's last [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=243.6s)]
*  tariffs on China. Now you're adding 34 percent on top of that. Beijing says it's taking the US to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  the World Trade Organization. It's also blocking the sale of rare earths into the US. Now these [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=256.4s)]
*  are important in the production of electronic goods. But worst of all, really it's the outlook [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=262.64s)]
*  for the global economy because the world's two biggest economies are at each other's throats now. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=268.32s)]
*  Their relationship is collapsing before our very eyes. Previously they'd been so interlinked [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=275.52s)]
*  and now you've got these trade barriers going up in this tit for tat war, who knows where it's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  going to stop. And really for all countries around the world it is potentially catastrophic. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=287.2s)]
*  Well that's the latest from Beijing. Let's hear from our State Department correspondent Tom [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=293.68s)]
*  Bateman. He's in Brussels where that NATO meeting has been going on. He told us more about the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=297.76s)]
*  reaction there's been from the White House team. Well remember first of all this is a defense [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  gathering but these 32 foreign ministers gathered within hours of Mr Trump making that announcement [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  on Wednesday night and it has been a dominant issue not just at the margins actually but even [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=315.92s)]
*  in the central policymaking council meeting yesterday where my understanding is that European [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=322.0s)]
*  foreign ministers put the issue of these tariffs directly to Marco Rubio the Secretary of State. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=327.84s)]
*  And what you heard in that report there was some of his response. He is dismissing those concerns. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=332.8s)]
*  He is also dismissing these sharp slides in stock markets with that explanation where he said well [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=338.96s)]
*  the markets are embedded in methods of production that are bad for the United States. What he means [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=344.96s)]
*  by that that's his diplomatic way of saying what President Trump has said in his words that he [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=349.84s)]
*  believes the world is ripping off the United States. But I have to say many economists dispute [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=354.96s)]
*  the entire basis of that type of analysis saying that it puts goods ahead of services and services [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=360.64s)]
*  are the big effective export of the United States. I've been speaking to European foreign ministers [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=367.84s)]
*  here. They are all vowing to retaliate and the big fear I think for the White House now is of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=372.96s)]
*  coordinated action for example between the Canadians and the European Union in terms of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=377.44s)]
*  retaliatory tariffs and certainly the Canadian foreign minister was hinting at that as she [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  arrived here today. Well that was Tom Bateman. Let's talk to our business presenter Tag Endreich who's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=388.16s)]
*  here in the studio with me. You can see on the screen where the Dow Jones is and it is open in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=393.12s)]
*  the last hour and more red. We've seen that for days now since this tariff announcement. We have. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=397.68s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that this has all turned out to be worse than many investors had expected. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=403.28s)]
*  You know yes there was a sell-off prior to Donald Trump's Rose Garden announcement. There was a [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  sell-off afterwards because what he actually announced turned out to be worse than what many [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=412.64s)]
*  of them had feared. And then just over three and a half hours ago we got that announcement from Beijing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  34 percent retaliatory tariffs export controls on those rare earth minerals that Donald Trump's [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=422.88s)]
*  prizes so greatly and what you effectively got to use a wartime analogy is the return fire [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=428.88s)]
*  from the the initial volley fired by Donald Trump on Wednesday night. We now have two of the world's [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=434.96s)]
*  biggest economies, the two world's two biggest economies at loggerheads and keep in mind we [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=440.96s)]
*  haven't yet heard yet from the European Union and how it's going to respond to this. In the words of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=446.48s)]
*  one analyst whose note I read earlier from Deutsche Bank this is the market pricing in the likelihood [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=451.76s)]
*  of a recession a likelihood that in the words of Muhammad Al-Aryan the noted economist is [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=457.36s)]
*  uncomfortably high and it's of course not just a market story the markets are a barometer of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=462.48s)]
*  fears for what lies ahead. Fears about job losses, fears about inflation and fears about what a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  continued high inflation could mean for the cost of borrowing. Ty thanks for taking us through all [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  of that. We will continue to watch the markets board throughout the course of the program. Let's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  speak now though to Kellyanne Shaw who's deputy director of the National Economic Council and was [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=484.0s)]
*  deputy for international economic affairs in the first Trump administration. Kellyanne welcome here [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=489.6s)]
*  to the program. So how do you think it's going? Thank you so much for having me. Well I think [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=494.96s)]
*  it's pretty clear that President Trump's Rose Garden announcement was completely breaking the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=501.68s)]
*  glass on the global trading system so my assumption in speaking with different folks around the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=507.2s)]
*  administration is that they're not surprised by some of the reactions from markets and from [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=512.8s)]
*  trading partners but the message from the White House is very much just stick with us let this [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=517.04s)]
*  play out stick with us through Q4 and the American economy will be back where it needs to be. You say [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  the markets aren't surprised every analyst has been shocked that I've been seeing through the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=528.88s)]
*  course of today consumers shocked by it prices now inevitably will go up the Trump team quite [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=535.44s)]
*  open about that. Is that what American voters actually cast their ballot for prices to go up? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=543.5200000000001s)]
*  Well I think there's a difference between the messaging to Main Street and to Wall Street and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that the markets had priced in some increase in tariffs but certainly the levels going up to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  46-49% in the case of China 54-79% was shocking to the markets and that's why you're seeing some [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=560.64s)]
*  of this really significant reaction not just from the US but from the world. Sure but what about consumers because they know that prices are going up that's what [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=567.84s)]
*  people in this administration are now saying is going to happen in the short term I was looking [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=574.8s)]
*  a little earlier the price of a basic iPhone is going to go up from $800 to $1100 groceries [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=579.68s)]
*  going up but we've seen what is happening to people's 401 pensions that is not what people [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=587.12s)]
*  put Donald Trump in the White House to do is it? Well I think people put Donald Trump in the White [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=593.28s)]
*  House to do many things including transform the global trading system and to rebalance it in a way [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=599.5999999999999s)]
*  that's more advantageous to the United States but you're right inflation was one of the top issues in [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=604.8s)]
*  the campaign and so this is where the administration has to walk and chew gum at the same time [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  and that's why they're making a pitch to the American people of this is short-term pain [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=615.04s)]
*  these tariffs will increase prices in the short term but stick with us and see the rest of our [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  economic package and that's their case to make to the American people but they are asking for that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=624.0s)]
*  grace and we'll see if the American people give it to them. In the short term I mean the idea is to [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=630.24s)]
*  get manufacturing back into the US now there are two problems with that it takes years to actually [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=636.56s)]
*  build those factories and for many of the companies the other reality is that even with [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=642.4s)]
*  these tariffs it is cheaper still to manufacture abroad so actually you have all this pain [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=648.56s)]
*  and it is not going to deliver the desired effect is it? Well what the administration would say to [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=655.92s)]
*  that is that tariffs aren't the only part of the president's economic plan he also has tax cuts [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=661.84s)]
*  deregulation cutting of fiscal spending energy diversity and so all of these things taken together [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=667.68s)]
*  are going to incentivize companies to move to the United States but clearly the number one [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=675.12s)]
*  topic on minds of companies and investors right now are looking for certainty in terms of the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=680.9599999999999s)]
*  tariffs and what's been interesting is that the messaging coming out from the president and others [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=685.8399999999999s)]
*  as of last night and this morning has been these tariffs are here to stay for a while and that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=690.4s)]
*  company should be making investment decisions based on at a minimum a 10% baseline tariff and [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=695.76s)]
*  potentially some of these larger tariffs but I do think that many of them will come down [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=700.96s)]
*  in the next few weeks and months as these negotiations proceed. The difficulty here is [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=704.96s)]
*  that he can't even convince his own members of senate Rand Paul was saying only yesterday [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=710.3199999999999s)]
*  republicans have tried these sorts of tariffs twice before in the 1890s and the 1930s and both [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=715.92s)]
*  times the republican party was destroyed there is huge political danger here isn't there? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=721.52s)]
*  Yeah there were a handful of senators who voted against the fentanyl tariffs at the same time that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=728.0s)]
*  the president announced these reciprocal tariffs but senators like senator Rand Paul are die hard [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=733.6s)]
*  free traders they have always been in opposition to the president's economic agenda so that's why [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=739.76s)]
*  you're hearing some of those comments come out but I do think that most republicans are with the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  president at least right now and I think we'll have to check back in a month three months six [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=748.64s)]
*  months a year from now to see where the party's at. That's interesting you put in that clause [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=753.84s)]
*  they're with the president right now I was listening to a CNBC analysts describing these [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=757.76s)]
*  announcements and the policy and the strategies kindergarten understanding of international trade [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=764.72s)]
*  even with the UK you have pretty equitable levels of trade and yet there's a 10% tariff that has [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=770.56s)]
*  been slapped on the UK how does that make sense and how does it make sense in terms of doing these [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=778.0s)]
*  things with traditional trading partners traditional allies the US is in danger of becoming a really [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=784.24s)]
*  unreliable partner now militarily when you look at Ukraine Russia and now economically with allies. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=791.52s)]
*  Yeah I understand on the one hand the reaction from many allies who haven't faced tariffs like [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=800.16s)]
*  this before but on the other I do think that claims of a breach in the transatlantic relationship [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=805.2s)]
*  are a bit overblown because what the Trump administration's economic ideology brings to [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=811.36s)]
*  the table is this idea that we can still be allies and also address our economic issues [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=816.48s)]
*  and that's very different than previous republican and democratic administrations over history [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=822.1600000000001s)]
*  who have said that where we have a national security relationship we're not going to raise [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  some of those economic issues for the sake of that national security relationship and what the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=831.6s)]
*  Trump administration is doing is raising those issues up at the same time and so they are walking [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=836.08s)]
*  and chewing gum. The trouble is people here in the UK are trying to work out what the economic issue is [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=841.12s)]
*  with the UK given the trading balance between the two countries. Well I think the administration [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=847.12s)]
*  has pointed out many unfair trade practices with the UK overall the relationship is balanced [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=852.72s)]
*  but the president issued this national trade estimate that talked about the UK's digital [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=858.48s)]
*  services tax he's talked about the VAT he's talked about unfair and unreciprocal tariff rates [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=862.48s)]
*  so those are issues that will have to be worked out but he did announce with Prime Minister [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=867.84s)]
*  Stammer that the two countries would be negotiating some sort of trade deal so my expectation is that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=871.84s)]
*  those conversations would continue and there may be relief on the UK side. Well we'll see because [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=877.76s)]
*  they've been talking about that trade deal for such a long time but we shall see if it actually [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=883.44s)]
*  comes to fruition. Kelly-Ann Shaw we have to leave it there but thank you so much for joining [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GP5Z7QO1Jc&t=887.92s)]
