# Hungary PM Viktor Orban to meet AfD party leader Alice Weidel | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE)
*  Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is due to meet Germany's AFD party leader, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=0.0s)]
*  Alice Vidal, in Budapest this morning. Vidal's far-right party shares [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=4.32s)]
*  Orbán's desire to rebuild Europe's relations with Russia despite the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  ongoing Ukraine war, as well as his strong anti-immigration stance. The [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=13.16s)]
*  meeting comes less than two weeks before a parliamentary election in Germany, in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=18.04s)]
*  which the AFD is expected to come a strong second. Earlier we spoke to our [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=22.2s)]
*  East and Central Europe correspondent Nick Thorpe, who's in Budapest. He told [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=26.84s)]
*  us why he thinks these leaders are meeting now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=30.6s)]
*  The other reason, of course, is Donald Trump's victory in the United States. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=56.84s)]
*  Elon Musk has welcomed Alice Vidal into the sort of democratic circle. He's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=60.64s)]
*  endorsed the AFD very strongly, and Mr Orbán really, as a friend of Trump, is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=67.0s)]
*  helping break down that firewall in European politics between right-wing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=73.0s)]
*  parties and the far-right. So in a way, Mr Orbán is helping Alice Vidal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=78.04s)]
*  Nick Thorpe, earlier I spoke to resident senior fellow and deputy director for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=83.52s)]
*  international studies at Think Tank Institute Montania, Georgina Wright. She [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=88.0s)]
*  told us what Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Germany's AFD party [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  leader, Alice Vidal, have in common. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=96.88s)]
*  You know, they're both far-right parties led by sort of nationalist parties, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=99.32s)]
*  and they're both very much in line with the party's vision of a new [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  party. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=108.24s)]
*  And I think what's really important, your correspondent just said that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=109.0s)]
*  before, is to really show a united front. I mean, you've got far-right [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=111.84s)]
*  parties that are doing really well electorally across Europe, but the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  main criticism has been that they don't really work together, and so they [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=119.32s)]
*  haven't actually managed to make Europe great again. So I think this is an [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=123.12s)]
*  attempt to say, you know, we don't sit in the same European party in the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=126.6s)]
*  European Parliament, but we can actually work together. And I think [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=130.4s)]
*  And what's your analysis of how successful the AFD may be in the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=134.16s)]
*  upcoming Germany elections? The polls put them running as possibly coming [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=138.0s)]
*  second. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=142.2s)]
*  It's too early to say, and it's often the case with the German elections, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=143.04s)]
*  that we really will have to wait and see. But what's absolutely clear is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=147.28s)]
*  they're doing much better than they were certainly at the last election, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  and, you know, 10 years ago, they really were a fringe party. And I [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=154.2s)]
*  think that's a really good point. And I think that's a really good point. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=157.92s)]
*  And, you know, 10 years ago, they really were a fringe party. So they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=161.52s)]
*  are asserting much more power. And you're seeing even in the German [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=165.04s)]
*  debate, you know, debates about, do we have to start learning to work [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=168.84s)]
*  with them in the Parliament or not? You know, until very recently, there [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=173.72s)]
*  was a Cordon sanitaire, meaning there was absolutely no working with them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=177.32s)]
*  And that might change. But all depends really on the election and the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=180.96s)]
*  result that will come out of it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  Many people might be shocked that, given Germany's far-right Nazi past, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=185.44s)]
*  that a far-right party is doing so well. What is their success down to? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=189.4s)]
*  I mean, several things. The first, I think, President Trump's re-election [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=195.72s)]
*  has certainly given wings to many of these parties. And, you know, we [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=199.72s)]
*  were hearing earlier Elon Musk direct support for AfD. But there are a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=203.68s)]
*  number of people across Europe who feel that the centrist party simply [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=207.76s)]
*  aren't delivering for them anymore. And you have a party, a far-right [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=211.84s)]
*  party, the Alternative for Deutschland, that's talking about immigration, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=216.12s)]
*  taking control of our borders, but also, you know, making sure that we are [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=219.56s)]
*  spending money, German money, on Germany, on those that need it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=224.36s)]
*  And so with inflation, with, you know, the cost of living crisis, that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  message is really cussing through. So the question is really what the other [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=232.84s)]
*  parties are able to put forward. There's been deep disillusion with the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=236.08s)]
*  current government, the current coalition that's been seen as [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  dysfunctional. We'll have to really wait and see who comes out first and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=242.48s)]
*  then what coalition might be possible. So we might see several months of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=246.24s)]
*  negotiation before we have a well-functioning German government. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=249.72s)]
*  In January, a firewall was breached that has been in place into the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=253.84s)]
*  Second World War when the AfD lent their support to legislation. That's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=257.52s)]
*  been criticised by former Chancellor Angela Merkel and by the Chancellor [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=262.36s)]
*  Schultz as well. Has that dented the AfD's support at all? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=267.28s)]
*  I think on the contrary, it's made it more popular to a certain extent [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=273.32s)]
*  because people think, well, actually, other parties are willing to work [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=277.44s)]
*  with it. So that means that it surely is much...it's not as radical as [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=280.76s)]
*  people might say. But I have to say, in Germany, there is still a majority of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  people who think that this party is dangerous, that haven't forgotten, of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=289.88s)]
*  course, what happened during the Second World War. So again, we really have [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  to wait and see until the election to kind of determine how far they have, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=297.6s)]
*  how well they've done and how far they've spread their support across [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  Germany. And we really need to wait and see. But I think this is also a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=307.36s)]
*  reckoning point for the centrist party. So you think if we are losing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=311.32s)]
*  support, what are we doing wrong and how can we change that? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmuVwZnTWE&t=314.48s)]
