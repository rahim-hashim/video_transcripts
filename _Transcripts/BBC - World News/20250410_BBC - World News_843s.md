On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced that he was hiking the levy to 125%, but the administration has now said that that figure did not include a pre-existing tariff of 20% which was imposed on countries the US said produces the drug fentanyl.
 
European and Asian markets saw gains on Thursday, but US shares slumped seconds after the market opened; with The Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes down over 4%, and the Nasdaq as much as 5% lower.

# US hitting China with 145% tariffs, White House confirms | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI)
*  Just in the last few moments, the BBC has confirmed that US tariffs against China add up to 145%. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=0.0s)]
*  That is on top of, that is including the existing 20% tariffs that were already imposed on the country at the beginning of the year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=10.0s)]
*  And also after yesterday's huge rally on Wall Street, today we are seeing a very different picture. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=20.0s)]
*  Share prices falling on the US stock exchange as uncertainty continues over the US trade policy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=26.0s)]
*  The Dow is down 3.4%, the S&P 500 down 4.2% and the Nasdaq is down 5%. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=32.0s)]
*  Trading however in Europe and Asia though saw prices surge. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=40.0s)]
*  So let's talk to our correspondents in Washington and in New York. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=44.0s)]
*  Jake Kwon joins us first and Jake, we've got this clarification from the White House as to the tariffs that China face. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=49.0s)]
*  Just talk us through what we're learning because initially we thought that China was on 125% tariff, already eye watering, but we've had some kind of clarity now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=59.0s)]
*  Yes, I mean this 145% is the clarification from the White House today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=70.0s)]
*  The BBC finally has that number now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=76.0s)]
*  But there was a bit of a confusion earlier because yes, as you say, Mr. Trump had tweeted earlier, sorry, put it on his truth social earlier that the tariff rate on China will be 125%. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=79.0s)]
*  So now the White House has clarified that yes, there is the existing 20% that Mr. Trump has slapped on China due to what he accuses China of is letting fentanyl flow to the US. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=92.0s)]
*  So now we have the 145%. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=104.0s)]
*  But I want to point out that this is kind of a telling of how much confusion and still uncertainty around this tariff announcement. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=107.0s)]
*  Even in the Congress here, we saw earlier the Republicans and the Democrat senators talk about this tariff issue and there seems to be an amazing amount of confusion. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=116.0s)]
*  Let me just read you one quote from Republican Senator Ron Johnson. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=128.0s)]
*  And he was saying, I still don't know what his total strategy is, referring to Mr. Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=133.0s)]
*  I don't know what the end game is here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=138.0s)]
*  And the Democratic Senator, Elisa Slotkin, she was saying, I'm just trying to understand what the hell is happening. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=141.0s)]
*  And it seems that there's even confusion amongst the White House, amongst the staff of Mr. Trump. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=148.0s)]
*  Yesterday we saw Mr. Jameson Greer, who is Mr. Trump's top trade official. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=154.0s)]
*  He was testifying in front of the Congress. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=161.0s)]
*  And as he was testified for hours, he appeared to be unaware of this 90 day pause that Mr. Trump has announced and that led him to being berated by one of the Democratic politicians saying that, hey, your boss seems to know something that you don't. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=164.0s)]
*  So all these uncertainty, it looms over what the market is going to do for the next 90 days. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah. And on that, let's cross over to Erin Delmore and have a look at what the markets are doing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=187.0s)]
*  Jake, thank you very much, because Erin, yesterday we saw that absolutely huge rally, that surge upwards. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=192.0s)]
*  Today, however, the markets are not looking so good. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=198.0s)]
*  Right. And that's a reaction to the sizable tariffs that remain in place on U.S. imports from China. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=203.0s)]
*  As you said, stands at 145 percent. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=209.0s)]
*  Twenty percent, the administration has said, is in response to China's handling of the fentanyl crisis and an additional 125 percent put into effect yesterday. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=212.0s)]
*  Now, that makes investors uneasy. And we're seeing it play out on Wall Street. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=220.0s)]
*  The Dow is down nearly 1700 points as we speak. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=223.0s)]
*  That's down 4.14 percent. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=227.0s)]
*  The S&P down closer to five percent. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=229.0s)]
*  The Nasdaq down more than five percent, in fact, about five and three quarters. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=232.0s)]
*  But what we need to do as much as we can talk about the historic rally yesterday on Wall Street is actually take the numbers back to April 2nd, which is when President Trump announced his tariffs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=236.0s)]
*  If we go back to that mark, the S&P is down around six percent. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=245.0s)]
*  So as much as we can talk about this roller coaster ride that we've had in the last weeks. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=249.0s)]
*  And yes, the S&P landed above nine percent yesterday. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=253.0s)]
*  That's a one day high since 2008. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=256.0s)]
*  Now, a one day high going back to as far as March 2020. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=258.0s)]
*  The Nasdaq saw its best day since 2021. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=261.0s)]
*  Yes, all banner numbers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=264.0s)]
*  But put it into context with what we've seen the last week and the S&P, that broad 500 company index is broadly down. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=265.0s)]
*  Erin, as always, thank you very much. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=272.0s)]
*  Ellen Delmore there, our North America business correspondent. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=274.0s)]
*  Also our thanks to Jake Kwon joining us from Washington on the very latest there. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=277.0s)]
*  And just a line coming from the former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who is saying that the threat, the instability from the falling of the markets and the falling prices for the U.S. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=282.0s)]
*  Treasury debt, that is, of course, the bonds. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=297.0s)]
*  That was the reason she reckons why Donald Trump then created this pause. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=299.0s)]
*  Of course, we're hearing from the White House that he this was always part of the plan. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=305.0s)]
*  So a little bit of confusion and not least with the tariffs on China, a lot to discuss. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=309.0s)]
*  I'm pleased to say that our economic correspondent Andy Verity joins us now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=315.0s)]
*  And Andy, we're hearing about that just confusion there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=318.0s)]
*  We know that the saying goes markets hate confusion. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=321.0s)]
*  Yes, but that's the messaging we're getting. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=323.0s)]
*  It's mood swings, isn't it? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=326.0s)]
*  We have this sudden euphoria overnight. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=328.0s)]
*  And then you're hit by this sobering realization in the hangover of the next day that you still have, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=330.0s)]
*  even if you don't have quite the multilateral trade war that Trump was talking about a few days ago, a bilateral trade war on a scale we haven't seen in decades with the U.S. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=336.0s)]
*  and China and all kinds of uncertainties facing the auto industry, facing the likes of Canada and Mexico, who still face 25 percent tariffs, basically all kinds of uncertainty. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=345.0s)]
*  And anyway, the trade war has just been postponed for 90 days. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=357.0s)]
*  He hasn't canceled it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=361.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=362.0s)]
*  And that's that's really important just to keep stressing there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=363.0s)]
*  Just we saw that the Wall Street has opened, opened a little bit lower. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=366.0s)]
*  There's still a lot of angst, I guess. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=373.0s)]
*  Europe, though, they were looking a little bit more comfortable today. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=376.0s)]
*  So what do we read into that comparison? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=380.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think you have to look at the timings of the various announcements. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=382.0s)]
*  The markets in Europe have been playing catch up for most of the day, but with some trepidation, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=385.0s)]
*  because even as they were looking at the S&P 500 that covers the shares of the top 500 companies listed in New York going up by nine percent yesterday, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=389.0s)]
*  they weren't actually edging up by as much because they knew that something bad would come today. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=399.0s)]
*  And they were right. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=405.0s)]
*  You know, the traders were predicting that there'd be less of a performance on the American markets today. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=406.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happened. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=410.0s)]
*  And I think part of it is that the fundamentals of the financial system are still looking shaky. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=414.0s)]
*  That sell off in US treasuries that we saw yesterday and the day before, although it's recovered some of the ground, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=421.0s)]
*  it hasn't got back to where it was before Trump announced these major tariffs over the past week or so. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=426.0s)]
*  And that has undermined confidence in a bedrock of the global financial system, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=431.0s)]
*  namely the stability of US treasuries and US treasury bonds, which until now were the safe haven in a time of crisis. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=435.0s)]
*  And that is what, well, certainly what the former US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was saying. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=442.0s)]
*  She was speaking to a US broadcaster and she said it was that the movement in the bonds that spooked, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=447.0s)]
*  or to use Donald Trump's word, yippied, or however he says it, him in order to create this pause. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=455.0s)]
*  Yeah, he said the markets were getting a little bit yippie. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=462.0s)]
*  We don't really know what that means, but it certainly doesn't seem to overstate how things were. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=464.0s)]
*  Because in 2008, the financial crisis, you didn't have people selling bonds. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=468.0s)]
*  They were a shelter. They were a place for a flight to safety. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=473.0s)]
*  You only had it really in the last few decades in the Covid crisis when there was the dash for cash. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=476.0s)]
*  People were worried governments couldn't afford all the money they'd have to spend on support measures during the lockdowns. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=481.0s)]
*  And therefore they sold even US treasury bonds. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=487.0s)]
*  That will have prompted some very heated discussions. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=490.0s)]
*  We can't know what they were. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=493.0s)]
*  But I think Janet Yellen is speculating that he would have been told in no uncertain terms, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=495.0s)]
*  you're undermining our status not only as a foundation stone of the global financial system, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=499.0s)]
*  but also as the place where people look to for stability. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=504.0s)]
*  And if you want to give up that status, that could also undermine the dollar. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=508.0s)]
*  And again, we're seeing today that people have been selling the dollar. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=511.0s)]
*  That's something that's going to worry President Trump at a time when, in theory, his tariffs, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=514.0s)]
*  if what he says is true, are going to be good for the American economy. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=520.0s)]
*  Andy, so much to discuss. Thank you so much as always. Andy Verity there. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=523.0s)]
*  So let's just pick up on that, our understanding now that the White House has clarified the tariffs on China as being at 145%. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=527.0s)]
*  We can speak to Zhang Yuanzhu, who's the Maurice R. Greenberg Senior Fellow for China Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=540.0s)]
*  Zoe, welcome to BBC News. I guess regardless of what the whether it's 125 or 145 percent, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=549.0s)]
*  if you count in that original 20 percent from January when Donald Trump came into office, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=557.0s)]
*  we're talking about unrealistic and absolutely unsustainable figures here. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=562.0s)]
*  Yes. And thank you very much for having me. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=568.0s)]
*  The tariffs hike is going to hurt the Chinese economy, especially the small and medium sized manufacturers that contribute to about 80 percent of Chinese export, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=571.0s)]
*  as well as about 70 to 80 percent of Chinese employment. So tariffs. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=583.0s)]
*  And as of today, news stories talk a lot about the canceling of orders and container shipment. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=589.0s)]
*  So this is not this is not a good news for the Chinese economy. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=595.0s)]
*  And this is not definitely not what the party or President Xi Jinping desires. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=598.0s)]
*  Now, China has steadily been accumulating U.S. Treasury securities, these these bonds over the last few decades. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=604.0s)]
*  Just explain to us their reasoning for doing that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=612.0s)]
*  And is there a potential that they could politically as a political motivation to undermine the United States? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=614.0s)]
*  Could they possibly start really selling those off aggressively? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=620.0s)]
*  China is the world's largest foreign exchange reserve holder and China's official foreign exchange reserves exceeded three trillion dollars and has been stabilized around that level for quite a few years. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=625.0s)]
*  And in terms of foreign exchange reserve management, the conventional method is to manage it to gain to invest in assets that is liquid and safe in order to safeguarding the value of foreign exchange reserves. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=640.0s)]
*  And it's just given that the U.S. Treasury is the risk free asset benchmark and it is also the most liquid and cash equivalent asset. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=655.0s)]
*  So it makes sense for central banks around the world, including the People's Bank of China, to buy U.S. Treasuries. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=667.0s)]
*  Now, over the past few over the past 10 months, the Chinese People's Bank of China, the Central Bank, has been decreasing its holding of U.S. Treasuries because of for in response to the need to diversifying away from Treasuries. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=673.0s)]
*  And that's because of the lack of some Treasuries in the aftermath of the West's grazing of Russian reserves. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=691.0s)]
*  So, but I would say that any instability in the Treasury's market is going to hurt China because simply because the size is so big. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=699.0s)]
*  Yes, so the dollar is well, it's perceived to be that that dollar Treasury bond is perceived to be risk free. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=710.0s)]
*  It's dangerous to undermine the dollar, to weaken the dollar. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=719.0s)]
*  And yet, Zoe, I know you've been writing about the Mar-a-Lago Accord named on Donald Trump's Miami, Florida residents. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=723.0s)]
*  Just talk us through what that means and why potentially it could be dangerous. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=732.0s)]
*  I think many people have been talking about the danger of the Mar-a-Lago Accord. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=738.0s)]
*  And I think the Mar-a-Lago Accord as it is envisioned or proposed is a way to restructure the global trading system and trying to reconcile a couple of seemingly conflicting agendas. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=745.0s)]
*  On the one hand, the proposed Mar-a-Lago Accord seemingly wanted to have U.S. security allies pay more and transform the U.S. from a net importing country economy to a net exporter. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=761.0s)]
*  And tries to have the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency, maintain the dollar's hegemonic power position. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=777.0s)]
*  But at the same time, trying to devaluate the dollar in a systematic way such that America's export can be competitive. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=785.0s)]
*  So none of this can be simultaneously achieved, I'm afraid. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=793.0s)]
*  And on top of that, the United States has been running a trade deficit for quite a long period of time, I guess, the last time the U.S. had a trade surplus within the 1970s. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=797.0s)]
*  So from that perspective, a lot of the proposed way to systematically devaluate the U.S. dollar may not necessarily achieve the goal of rebalancing the trade. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=808.0s)]
*  If anything that we have learned from the Plaza Accord, that is not successful. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=825.0s)]
*  Zoe, thank you very much for just talking us through that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=830.0s)]
*  Really good to get that kind of clarity. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=834.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjtKZ-H-5WI&t=836.0s)]
