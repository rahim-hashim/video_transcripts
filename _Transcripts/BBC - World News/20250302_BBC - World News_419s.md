# European leaders to meet for Ukraine summit in UK | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo)
*  Hello and welcome to Downing Street. I'm Anita McVey and here at BBC News we are going to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=0.0s)]
*  be keeping you right up to date throughout the day on all the developments in this crucial [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=6.5s)]
*  Ukraine war summit which is taking place just a stone's throw from here. In the words of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=11.94s)]
*  the BBC's political editor Chris Mason, the stakes for this summit are colossal. After [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=18.54s)]
*  that extraordinary meeting in the Oval Office involving President Trump and President Zelensky [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=24.46s)]
*  on Friday, two obvious and huge questions. One, will leaders gathered here today be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=29.92s)]
*  focusing on trying to work out how they can patch up that relationship? Obviously they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=37.64s)]
*  will. But also, plan B, what will they do if they can't fix those problems that we saw [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=43.36s)]
*  between President Zelensky of Ukraine and US President Donald Trump on Friday? So a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=50.64s)]
*  huge amount at stake today. Well, we got some insight into the direction of travel a little [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=56.96s)]
*  earlier when the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, was speaking to the BBC's Laura [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=63.12s)]
*  Coonsburg. He was asked for his reaction first of all to what happened in the Oval Office [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=67.36s)]
*  on Friday between Presidents Trump and Zelensky. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=71.52s)]
*  Clearly, you know, there's a lot of tension, the cameras were on, nobody wants to see that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  But I spoke to President Trump, I spoke to President Zelensky. Obviously we then had [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  President Zelensky to Downing Street yesterday and I spoke to President Macron after that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=85.48s)]
*  and then to President Trump. And the purpose, or my driving purpose, has been to bridge [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=90.08s)]
*  this, if you like, and get us back to the central focus. And as a result of the meeting [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=96.12s)]
*  yesterday we had quite a long time with President Zelensky, then President Macron and President [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=103.56s)]
*  Trump on the phone. We've now agreed that the United Kingdom, along with France and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=108.36s)]
*  possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  then we'll discuss that plan with the United States. So in those calls on Friday night, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  through the meeting yesterday into the calls again last night, I think we've got a step [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  in the right direction because, as I say, nobody wants to see what happened on Friday [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=131.2s)]
*  but it's really important that we keep our central focus, which is lasting peace in Ukraine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=135.72s)]
*  Nobody wants any more bloodshed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=142.4s)]
*  And everybody wants to hear the details of what the proposals might be that you are trying [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=143.8s)]
*  to get agreed. But what happens matters so much because it's about the trust and the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=147.6s)]
*  relationship between the two men at the centre of this, President Zelensky and President [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=154.36s)]
*  Trump. President Trump said it's difficult to do business like this. He made it completely [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=158.84s)]
*  clear that he didn't have, in that moment, very much sympathy for Ukraine. He was berating [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  President Zelensky, telling him he should be grateful. And I think, Prime Minister, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=172.32s)]
*  anyone who's known you for a long time would have a pretty good guess that you would have [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  felt deeply uncomfortable watching what played out, did you? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=180.64s)]
*  Yes, I felt uncomfortable. Nobody wants to see that. But the important thing is how to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=185.28s)]
*  react to that. There are a number of different routes people could go down. One is to ramp [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  up the rhetoric as to how outraged we all are or not. The other is to do what I did, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  which is roll up my sleeves, pick up the phone, talk to President Trump, talk to President [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=204.0s)]
*  Zelensky, then invite President Zelensky for an extensive meeting yesterday, warm welcome, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=208.52s)]
*  and then further pick up the phone to President Macron and President Trump afterwards. Because [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=213.88000000000002s)]
*  my reaction was we have to bridge this, we have to find a way that we can all work together [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  because in the end, we've had three years of bloody conflict now, we need to get to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=225.76s)]
*  that lasting peace. And I have to say, I've spoken to President Trump a number of times, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=230.76s)]
*  I've met him twice, we had a long session on Thursday. I'm clear in my mind that he [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  does want lasting peace. He does want an end to the fighting in Ukraine. I'm absolutely [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  clear that's what his motive is. I agree with that. President Zelensky agrees with that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=248.2s)]
*  I think everybody agrees with that apart from Putin. In the end, that remains the central [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=253.68s)]
*  most important thing, which is why we took a step forward in my view last night when [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=259.76s)]
*  we agreed that we would work on a plan for stopping the fighting and then, as it were, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=264.0s)]
*  discuss that plan with the United States. That's a step forward from where we were on [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=270.48s)]
*  Friday and an important step forward. So Keir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister, well, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=273.68s)]
*  the conservative leader, was also asked what she thinks about Keir Starmer's plan for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=279.44s)]
*  the UK and France to work with Kiev to stop the war. I think we need to know, as you say, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=284.4s)]
*  exactly what that means. Last week, I did ask him when he talked about putting British troops [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=289.84s)]
*  on the ground, where was the money coming from, what were the guarantees around that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=294.84s)]
*  We certainly shouldn't be doing it on our own. And looking at the scenes from last week, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=298.88s)]
*  it's really important that this summit that the Prime Minister is having today goes well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=303.64s)]
*  We support him in that. This is a key issue of national interest for us. There is not [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=307.76s)]
*  a difference between the Conservative and Labour parties in terms of the extent of support [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=313.28s)]
*  that we have for Ukraine. People know what we did under Prime Minister Johnson and his [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=317.0s)]
*  successors and we want to make sure that the Prime Minister is successful in helping Ukraine, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=322.28s)]
*  but also in maintaining our national interest at all times. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  What did you think when you saw those scenes in the Oval Office on Friday night with President [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=330.88s)]
*  Trump berating President Zelenskyy? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=335.76s)]
*  Honestly, my heart went out to President Zelenskyy. I watched it and I couldn't believe [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=339.28s)]
*  what was happening. He was being humiliated. I don't think we should conduct these sorts [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=345.84s)]
*  of difficult conversations in front of the cameras. And we have to remember that President [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  Zelenskyy is a hero. He is the person who represents that strength and resilience of the Ukrainian [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=355.44s)]
*  people. Whatever differences and difficulties we might have during negotiations, we need [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=361.8s)]
*  to be able to set them aside when everyone is watching. The only person who would have [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=367.48s)]
*  liked that would have been Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=370.8s)]
*  Let me tell you who is going to be at this crucial meeting today. It is quite a list, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  which is why I have it all in front of me. I don't leave anyone out. We are expecting [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=378.6s)]
*  the Italian Prime Minister, Giorgio Maloney, to arrive at Downing Street a little later [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=383.72s)]
*  before heading to that meeting, which is taking place at Lancaster House. There will be the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=388.68s)]
*  leaders of Ukraine, France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=393.36s)]
*  Canada, Finland, Sweden, Czechia and Romania. The Turkish Foreign Minister will be there, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=400.12s)]
*  the NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will be there and the presidents of the European [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=405.52s)]
*  Commission and the European Council will be there. It is a huge gathering hosted by the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=409.16s)]
*  UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otHfHQjUQBo&t=416.4s)]
