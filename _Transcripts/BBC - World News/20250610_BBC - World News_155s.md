Video Description: Russia has launched one of its largest strikes on Kyiv, injuring four people and causing widespread damage across seven of the capital's ten districts, officials said.
 
Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched 315 drones overnight across the country.
 
Further south in the port city of Odesa, two people were killed after drone attacks hit residential buildings and medical facilities, including a maternity ward, officials said. Zelensky later said 13 people had also been injured there.
 
The overnight attack was "one of the largest strikes on Kyiv", Zelensky said on social media.

# Russian strikes in Ukraine hit Kyiv and kill two in Odesa | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM)
*  Ukrainian officials say the capital Kiev and the port city of Odessa have come under massive Russian drone attacks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=0.0s)]
*  Eyewitnesses say there were at least a dozen explosions. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=7.0s)]
*  In Odessa, evacuated maternity and medical facilities were hit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=10.0s)]
*  The governor said two people were killed and at least four wounded. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=13.0s)]
*  Let's go live to Kiev now and our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=17.0s)]
*  And the scale of this is quite large, isn't it, Paul? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=20.0s)]
*  Yeah, not one of the largest so far, but frankly the kind of scale of these things has shifted in the last few weeks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=24.0s)]
*  There was a graphic that was produced this morning saying that Ukraine had experienced more than 4,000 drones in a single month, the month of May. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=32.0s)]
*  So the whole pace of Russia's drone attacks has certainly increased and we saw more of that last night with hundreds more drones. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=43.0s)]
*  We saw and heard them flying over the city for several hours. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=51.0s)]
*  The air defense systems around the city were working overtime to try and shoot them down. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=56.0s)]
*  There were multiple large explosions. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=60.0s)]
*  I could see fires off to the north of us here and some of those drones were literally flying over the center of the city. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=63.0s)]
*  No great reports of damage. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=71.0s)]
*  Some buildings hit, no real casualties to speak of. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=74.0s)]
*  But as you mentioned, in the city of Odessa, we've heard of at least two people being killed there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=78.0s)]
*  So it is very much following a familiar pattern, albeit now at a rather escalated level. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=85.0s)]
*  And with all these attacks going on, what are the prospects for any further Russia-Ukraine talks? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=92.0s)]
*  Absolutely none in the offing at the moment. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=100.0s)]
*  We are right now in the middle of another negotiated prisoner swap. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=103.0s)]
*  We saw the first groups of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners being exchanged yesterday. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=108.0s)]
*  We understand that more may follow today and tomorrow. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=112.0s)]
*  But that's really the only thing that's been achieved as a result of international and American diplomacy [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=116.0s)]
*  since Donald Trump came into office proclaiming his willingness and ability to sort this war out double quick. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=124.0s)]
*  President Zelensky, in his statement overnight, said that Russian missile and drone strikes are louder [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=131.0s)]
*  than the efforts of the United States and others around the world to force Russia into peace. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=138.0s)]
*  For all the talk and the efforts to secure a ceasefire, there is absolutely no prospect of that at the moment. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=143.0s)]
*  And at the moment, no prospect even of another round of negotiations. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cm44t0h2cM&t=150.0s)]
