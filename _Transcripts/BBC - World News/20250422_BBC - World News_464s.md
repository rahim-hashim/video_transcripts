# US growth forecast to be hit hardest from Donald Trump’s tariffs, IMF says | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw)
*  Now, let's go straight to the US and in a few minutes here on the program, we'll be with Katrina Perry, who's in Ohio today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=0.0s)]
*  gauging the mood among businesses and ordinary Americans as we approach the first 100 days of the Trump administration. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  But let's start by checking in on the markets. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Well, the New York Exchange opened in the last half an hour or so after more market turmoil yesterday, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=20.56s)]
*  another wave of uncertainty after Donald Trump made it clear he wants to fire the Fed Chair, Jerome Powell. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  Legally, it's thought he can't, but that may not stop him actually trying. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=32.16s)]
*  All of that, again, scaring investors. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=36.96s)]
*  So let's go live to New York and to Erin Dalmore. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=39.36s)]
*  And Erin, the Dow is on course for the worst April since the Great Depression. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=42.56s)]
*  No sign of an end to the uncertainty, is there? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=47.84s)]
*  No sign of an end to the uncertainty, Matthew. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=50.4s)]
*  And that's exactly what has investors so on edge these days. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=53.52s)]
*  You know, a bit of news, solid news about whether the tariff rates could be lowered or permanently adjusted [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=56.96s)]
*  would really go a long way towards shoring up investor confidence here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=62.88s)]
*  But we're not seeing that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=66.0s)]
*  Instead, we're seeing pauses and rumors of negotiation and a sky high tariff rate on Chinese imports into the US and US goods imported into China. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=67.04s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=74.88s)]
*  Well, yesterday we saw all three major US indexes close more than 2 percent lower. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=76.08s)]
*  And now we're a bit of a bump up back this morning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=81.2s)]
*  You know, right now, all three indexes are in the green, edging close to 2 percent up, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=84.56s)]
*  seeing a little bit of that balance, a little bit of shoring up. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=89.2s)]
*  But again, it just comes after a very sharp sell off yesterday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  And to put things in context, Matthew, we so often talk about these movements up and down. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=96.48s)]
*  But if we go back to April 2nd, the day when President Trump announced his so-called reciprocal tariffs on Liberation Day, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=100.8s)]
*  we now see all three major US indexes more than 9 percentage points down since April 2nd. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=106.88s)]
*  That, for me, is the headline. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=112.64s)]
*  It is really interesting what is going on, because normally when US stocks fall, so do foreign stocks. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=114.32s)]
*  That is not happening at the moment. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  Investors switching from American to foreign stocks, some of which have had their best results inside the last 52 weeks. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=121.84s)]
*  So that is new. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=129.6s)]
*  Now, given what you were saying, what is happening on the markets yields from bonds again going up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=131.6s)]
*  There's pressure on the dollar. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=137.2s)]
*  And that is putting enormous pressure on the president on economic policy, isn't it? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=139.04s)]
*  Which partly explains why he's going toe to toe with your own pal. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=144.56s)]
*  Yes, I think you've really put together well all of the pressures that are facing the economy now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=150.72s)]
*  And President Trump has found his boogeyman in this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  He's decided to target Fed Chair Jerome Powell. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=158.56s)]
*  And we see this in repeated posts on social media. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=161.44s)]
*  You know, he's nicknaming the Fed Chair Mr. Too Late. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  He's calling him slow. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=166.16s)]
*  He called him a major loser. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=167.28s)]
*  These are pretty classic types of techniques by President Trump to put pressure on people in government who he disagrees with. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=169.12s)]
*  And the disagreement right now is President Trump thinks that the Fed Chair and the Federal Reserve as a whole [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=175.2s)]
*  should lower interest rates, which he says would make borrowing costs cheaper. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=180.4s)]
*  And they would make borrowing costs cheaper for consumers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=184.4s)]
*  But the Federal Reserve here is trying to safeguard the economy and trying to keep a recession from taking hold. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=187.2s)]
*  They have two mandates here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  One is for maximum employment and the other one is for price stability. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  And they're trying to fight inflation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  So Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that the Fed is not ready to cut interest rates. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  And this is really what's leading to that standoff. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=203.6s)]
*  Chair Powell has said that he can't be terminated by law. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=207.04s)]
*  And he intends to serve out his term until his post is up in 2026, spring of 2026. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=209.92s)]
*  But President Trump has said if I want him out of there, he'll be out of there real fast. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=215.6s)]
*  Yep. Hence the uncertainty. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Erin, thanks very much for the latest there from New York. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=222.0s)]
*  Now, also in the last hour, the IMF has downgraded U.S. growth forecasts by nearly 1 percent, 0.9 percent. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  Last week, we heard the managing director highlight the dangers of Donald Trump's tariffs to the global economy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=233.76s)]
*  Well, with me here in the studio is Darshini David, our deputy economics editor. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  And as I say, Darshini, a downgrade from the IMF. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=244.32s)]
*  They went through a variety of countries. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=247.92s)]
*  Just talk us through the headline figures here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, isn't it, Matthew? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=252.56s)]
*  We've talked about this a lot in the last few weeks. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  Second of April, of course, President Trump basically ripping up the World Trade Order as we've known it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=255.92s)]
*  Now, that's caused the IMF, unsurprisingly, to rip up its forecasts as well. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=261.12s)]
*  It's brought out several scenarios, in fact, because like the rest of us, it doesn't quite know what's going to happen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=265.12s)]
*  This policies keep changing all the time. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=270.4s)]
*  They have downgraded global growth. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=273.12s)]
*  They say it'll be somewhere between between two and a half and three or maybe just over three percent this year on average. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=274.88s)]
*  That is quite a downgrade from the previous figure. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=282.0s)]
*  When you look beneath the surface of what's going on there, it's not going to surprise you to hear that it's the U.S. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=285.24s)]
*  where we're seeing that major forecast now expected, forecast change, now expected to expand by less than two percent this year. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=290.12s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that they're forecasting a recession there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=296.76s)]
*  So that's part of the reason why we heard Erin there talking about the stock markets in Wall Street. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=300.08s)]
*  It's part of the reason why you've seen the stock markets rallying a bit in the United States. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=304.32s)]
*  Having said that, we've heard the chief economist from the IMF talking in the last hour. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  He says the risk of recession in the U.S. is close to 40 percent. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  That's up from 25 percent in the autumn. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=317.4s)]
*  So you can see where the risks lie. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=319.36s)]
*  Quite a jump. Now, as well as what you said about the U.S., take me through the downgrade to the UK, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=320.56s)]
*  because as well as a downgrading growth, they've also pointed to inflation figures that perhaps may well be, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=327.2s)]
*  if it plays out this way, the worst in the G7. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=334.84s)]
*  It could be, but there's some interesting things going on at play here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=338.12s)]
*  Now, as you mentioned, there's been a downgrade to the UK's growth forecast. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=340.96s)]
*  It's 1.1 percent of the IMF reckons for this year. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=344.68s)]
*  That might sound familiar because that's broadly in line with what official forecasters here in the UK are saying. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=347.68s)]
*  And indeed, the IMF, when they were asked what exactly is going on here, talked about the tariffs. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  They also talked about some of the domestic forces that play here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  Remember, there's been tax rises, etc., etc. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  And again, some of the inflation changes we're likely to see are due to things like the way energy prices are regulated here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=363.8s)]
*  So those things in combination make it quite tricky when you're looking at, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=369.56s)]
*  quite frankly, the economy after a tricky few years over the last few years as it's been. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=373.72s)]
*  It is tough given the government here keeps talking about growth and that has not been going the way they wanted to have a downgrade like this. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=378.56s)]
*  Well, that is more problems on problems. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  Let's talk about the sort of trade deals that all of these countries are trying to negotiate. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  I was struck by something the Japanese delegation said over the weekend where they said it is proving difficult to make progress [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  because every time they meet with American officials, there is a new thing on the table. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=403.2s)]
*  That is problematic. That is something we've heard before from other countries as well, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=407.96s)]
*  which suggests some of these deals may well not be in the short term that perhaps people are hoping for. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=412.52s)]
*  Indeed, because the clock is ticking here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=418.28s)]
*  We do know, don't we, that a lot of these countries have only got a temporary stay, so to speak, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=420.2s)]
*  when it comes to those extra retaliatory tariffs, so-called retaliatory tariffs, we should say. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  But on top of that as well, the US holds a lot of these cards. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  Trade negotiations are always tricky, but there is this deadline. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=433.0s)]
*  So you can see more and more countries, the UK included, sort of thinking, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=436.6s)]
*  well, actually, we're never going to go back to where we were before with the complete elimination of the Trump tariffs. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=440.16s)]
*  You may just see some of them stopped in their tracks. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=445.72s)]
*  But as you say, every time they come back to the table, we're hearing this from a lot of countries, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=448.24s)]
*  more and more obstacles are put in their way. It's going to be nail-biting times. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=452.04s)]
*  The IMF says if we were to take away these trade barriers, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=456.36s)]
*  we get back to seeing the kind of growth prospects that we talked about before. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=459.4s)]
*  That doesn't seem to be happening in a hurry. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEKOnuwdqw&t=462.84000000000003s)]
