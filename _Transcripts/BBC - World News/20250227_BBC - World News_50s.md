*  That's the hardest question you asked today [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL6yCNa-tBU&t=35.92s)]
*  Well Ash and Pikachu's journey might have ended on camera but it's only what you see on TV [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL6yCNa-tBU&t=38.16s)]

*  Ash's journey is continuing and his partner Pikachu is right next to him [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL6yCNa-tBU&t=45.68s)]
