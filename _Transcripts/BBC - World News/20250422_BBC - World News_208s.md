Video Description: According to scientists, just 4,000 to 6,000 snow leopards are left in the wild - with roughly 300 of these in Pakistan, the third-largest population in the world.
 
Despite laws protecting them, between 221 to 450 snow leopards are killed each year, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said, which has contributed to a 20% decline in the global population over the past two decades.
 
So, how is Pakistan using artificial intelligence (AI) to help keep these animals safe?

# Could AI help save snow leopards from extinction? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek)
*  Snow leopards are at risk of extinction and scientists believe their population has declined [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=0.0s)]
*  by 20% in the past two decades. Now, conservationists in Pakistan are testing AI-powered cameras [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=5.4s)]
*  to try to save the big cats. Our Pakistan correspondent Aziz Moshiri has been finding [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=11.8s)]
*  out how. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=16.8s)]
*  Beautiful, solitary and in captivity. Today all snow leopards are at risk. Conservationists [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=18.48s)]
*  are hoping technology could help save them. There are at least 300 snow leopards in Pakistan. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=30.12s)]
*  We set off trying to understand what's being done to protect them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=38.68s)]
*  Snow leopards are also called ghosts of the mountains because they're so hard to spot [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=42.96s)]
*  and therefore to count. Yet conservationists say tracking and documenting them is important [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=47.64s)]
*  because their survival is vital to our ecosystem. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  By hunting ibex and blue sheep, snow leopards prevent overgrazing and protect mountain [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=57.0s)]
*  habitats. But sometimes they set their sights on villages and softer targets. Farmers hunt [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=62.6s)]
*  snow leopards in retaliation. But their population is in decline around the world, so conservationists [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=72.08s)]
*  are trying to convince locals to spare them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  Zittara lost all six of her sheep in one day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=84.16s)]
*  And you haven't been able to replace those animals? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=87.6s)]
*  No, I don't have any money now. How can I buy them? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  One AI project is trying to prevent these incidents from happening at all. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=95.12s)]
*  The camera is covered inside the box. It has its own lithium battery. The battery is also [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=99.72s)]
*  customized and customized specifically for this area. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=106.72s)]
*  So how does it all work? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=110.6s)]
*  This is the early predatory warning system. And after years and using artificial intelligence, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=112.74s)]
*  this camera can now tell if what's in front of it is an animal, a human or even a snow [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=118.02s)]
*  leopard. The goal is to warn communities that a snow leopard is nearby so that they can [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  move their livestock to safety. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=128.6s)]
*  The camera captures these images locally and then transfers them to a dashboard. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  What's that one right there? That's me. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=135.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=136.98s)]
*  But I'm clearly a human being. Is it this? Asif, do you think it's my jacket? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=138.98s)]
*  It might be your jacket. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  But not everyone agrees technology can help. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=146.33999999999997s)]
*  We used to have 40 to 50 sheep. Now we've only got four or five. And the reason is the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=151.1s)]
*  threat from snow leopards and from ibex eating the grass. So what benefit are we getting [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=156.61999999999998s)]
*  from these snow leopards? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=162.14s)]
*  The villagers we spoke to choose to rely on each other. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=165.22s)]
*  So you've seen attacks. Was it scary? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=168.82s)]
*  She says no, not at all. When she's around, it's the snow leopard that runs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=172.26s)]
*  You're the boss. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=176.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=178.34s)]
*  For now, the threat to snow leopards is still present. This one was orphaned. She's been [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=179.34s)]
*  in captivity for 12 years and doesn't know how to hunt. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=187.5s)]
*  She likes scratches. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=190.98s)]
*  Caretakers worry that if she's released, she'll go after livestock and become another casualty. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  They say the world outside is still not safe enough. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRTyQcXe5ek&t=199.58s)]
