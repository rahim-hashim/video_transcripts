# Donald Trump's tariffs: Is there a plan? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8)
*  Wednesday was quite a day, quite a day for podcasters. We had recorded all sorts of wonderful stuff [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=0.0s)]
*  which we had to junk because it all got very quickly out of date. The issue was this, an [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=5.28s)]
*  announcement on Truth Social from Donald Trump that dropped most of the high tariffs around the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=10.64s)]
*  world down to 10 percent except for China. They had 125 percent and here is how he explained [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=16.0s)]
*  what he was doing. Well I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=23.52s)]
*  getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid unlike these [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  champions because we have a big job to do. No other president would have done what I did, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=35.12s)]
*  no other president. I know the presidents, they wouldn't have done it and it had to be done. What [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=39.84s)]
*  was happening to us on trade, not only with, you know, if you look at it, not only with China, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=44.0s)]
*  but China was by far the biggest abuser in history and others also, but somebody had to do it. They [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  had to stop because it was not sustainable. So tariffs apparently paused for now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=57.84s)]
*  Has Donald Trump rode back from the brink? Welcome to AmeriCast. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  AmeriCast. AmeriCast from BBC News. Hello it's Anthony in Arlington, Virginia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=68.72s)]
*  And it's Justin at home in South London. And it is Mariana aka misinformation in the worldwide [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=75.84s)]
*  headquarters. Okay, it is one o'clock in the afternoon in London on the 10th of April and I [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=81.52s)]
*  say all of that because who knows where we will be by two o'clock in the afternoon or wherever and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  we've had to junk everything we've already done. So we're kind of, we're meeting aren't we in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=94.08s)]
*  temporary studios around the world, but that doesn't matter because there is so much to talk [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=98.56s)]
*  about that is itself temporary. You never quite know with Donald Trump how long anything is going [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  to last. So I think it's kind of fitting, isn't it actually, that we're all in temporary places. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=108.56s)]
*  And also Mariana that all of this is happening because of social media posts. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=112.88s)]
*  It is. In order to figure out what is or isn't going on inside Donald Trump's head, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  the million dollar question, it seems like Truth Social is your best portal. That's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=122.48s)]
*  Donald Trump's own social media site. And if you look at what happened yesterday, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=128.0s)]
*  so we're recording on Thursday, so Wednesday of this week, you had Donald Trump saying, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=134.96s)]
*  be cool, everything's going to work out well. The be cool was in capitals, just so you got the message. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  The USA will be bigger and better than ever before. And then, and then four hours later, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=146.96s)]
*  the be cool message had slightly evolved. And he essentially said, based on the lack of respect [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=152.88s)]
*  that China has shown to the world's markets, I'm raising the tariff charged to China by the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  United States of America to 125% effective immediately. And he then issued what he called [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=164.4s)]
*  this sort of 90-day pause on the other tariffs that he'd imposed and brought them all to this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=170.8s)]
*  10% level. So what do we make of that? Well, you know, remember just a couple of days ago, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=177.68s)]
*  there were those reports about a 90-day pause. The stock market surged and the White House came out [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=186.4s)]
*  and said, no, we're not even considering that. That's ridiculous. It's fake news. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=191.28s)]
*  And here we go. Two days later, we have that 90-day pause. And the stock market rebounded [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=194.96s)]
*  quite dramatically just within minutes of Donald Trump's truth social announcement. I think, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=201.04s)]
*  ultimately, some of the major indices here in the United States were up about 8% or 9% made up about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=206.4s)]
*  half of the losses that we've had this entire week. So at least investors seem to think Donald [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=212.08s)]
*  Trump is backing away from this kind of global restructuring of trade policy, even as he is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=217.68s)]
*  leaning into China and a fight with China and trying to make China the villain here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=225.36s)]
*  And as ever, he had his own explanation for what he had done. Let's listen to that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=229.28s)]
*  And I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning, just wrote it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=233.6s)]
*  up. We didn't have the use of — we didn't have access to lawyers or anything. We just wrote it up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=241.04s)]
*  We wrote it up from our hearts, right? It was written from the heart. And I think it was well [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=247.12s)]
*  written, too, but it was written from the heart. It was written as something that I think was very [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=252.72s)]
*  positive for the world and for us. And we don't want to hurt countries that don't need to be hurt. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=258.0s)]
*  And they all want to negotiate. The only problem is, you know, you can only do so many at one time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=264.8s)]
*  It's like — it's — we want to do it right. We want to get it right. We want to take care of them, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=269.28s)]
*  but we have to take care of our country. So — but this was something, certainly, we've been talking [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=275.28s)]
*  about for a period of time, and we decided to pull the trigger. And we did it today, and we're happy [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=280.0s)]
*  about it. And, Anthony, on the domestic politics, it's really important, isn't it, that China — [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  never mind the kind of effect on geopolitics — but on domestic politics, he's singling out China, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=292.4s)]
*  and that is something in domestic American political terms you can do. Because the argument [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=298.96s)]
*  about whether China is an abuser of trade practices has sort of been won, hasn't it? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=306.08s)]
*  The Democrats would sort of fold in with that. And I think most Americans would believe — even [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=311.28s)]
*  people who don't follow these things very much — would sort of have an understanding of what [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=316.08s)]
*  they think is malpractice from China that deserves to be punished. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. They view China as a major international rival, not just economically, but also militarily, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=325.44s)]
*  politically. It fits much more neatly into kind of the broad strokes of American foreign policy [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=331.04s)]
*  over the past 10 years or so. So it fits with what Joe Biden was trying to do. He left [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=337.76s)]
*  tariffs that Donald Trump put in in his first term on China. He worked more to organize U.S. allies [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  in the Pacific region to position themselves to resist Chinese expansion. So all of this makes [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=351.12s)]
*  sense in kind of a cohesive American strategy in a way that those massive tariffs on the EU [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=358.88s)]
*  and on South Korea and on Japan and on all of these other countries that the United States [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=366.8s)]
*  is supposed to be working closely with just never did. I mean, it's funny he talked about — he [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=371.6s)]
*  didn't consult with lawyers, he wrote it from the heart. I mean, I think that's pretty obvious [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=376.56s)]
*  because there was so much confusion after this announcement came in. There was — you had Steve [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=380.16s)]
*  Besant, the — or Scott Besant, the Treasury secretary, standing there at a press gaggle saying [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=386.0s)]
*  that these tariffs applied to Canada and Mexico would actually — would have raised tariffs on [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  Canada and Mexico. Then they had to come back and say, no, actually they don't. The old tariffs [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  apply there. They had to clarify whether the specific industry-targeted tariffs were affected [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=401.6s)]
*  by this. They weren't. What level of tariffs there were coming out. It was just — it was chaos. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=406.64s)]
*  You could see it in our BBC chats trying to figure all of this out as the story unfolded. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=412.56s)]
*  You could see it in the coverage from reporters and the questions from reporters at the White House. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  I was going to say that I am appreciating that phrase, it came from the heart, which seems to be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=422.24s)]
*  a kind of pretty spot-on way of describing almost every post on social media, particularly [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=428.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's sort of capitalized-slash-semi-capitalized posts on truth social. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=433.92s)]
*  There's something about — I don't know, I think it's quite interesting the kind of emotional slant [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  that Donald Trump has put on that, like the kind of this idea of like, we felt like doing it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  We sort of decided — and we don't want these other countries to be in trouble or harmed, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=450.72s)]
*  and we've decided we felt like it was the time to do this. Does a U-turn exist in the world of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=455.76s)]
*  Donald Trump? And if it does, is this what it looks like? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=462.48s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? A U-turn doesn't exist. He's the kind of postmodern rightist. You think [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=465.6s)]
*  of all those people on the left in American politics who claim their own experience and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=471.12s)]
*  their own kind of vision of who they are and all the other things that people kind of on the post-modern [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=476.16s)]
*  left claim. He's the equivalent on the right, isn't he? There is no such thing as objective [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=481.68s)]
*  truth. There is only his truth, just as some people on the left say. There is only their truth about [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=487.12s)]
*  their experience and all the rest of it. I just think you raise a really fascinating point, kind [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=491.52s)]
*  of central political point about Trump, which is that he does — because of who he is and because [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=495.68s)]
*  of the way he is — he manages to get away with so much more than any kind of ordinary person would [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  do. And we ought to hear what the Democrats were saying. I don't know what we all thought of this, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=506.4s)]
*  but Chuck Schumer, who's still there, still plugging away, poor guy, sounding, I thought, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=510.96s)]
*  a bit knackered, actually, the Democrats' leader in the Senate, doing his best to sort of whip us [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=515.84s)]
*  into a frenzy of outrage at what Donald Trump had done. This is chaos. This is government by chaos. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=522.0s)]
*  He keeps changing things from day to day. His advisers are fighting among themselves, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=531.6s)]
*  calling each other names. And you cannot run a country with such chaos, with such unpredictability, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=537.44s)]
*  with such lack of understanding of what's going on in the world and the facts. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=548.16s)]
*  When there's chaos, already damage is done, irretrievable damage is done. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  So I think Schumer was picking up there on the chaos that happened after this announcement [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  and the confusion as well and trying to paint that as a broader picture of the Trump administration, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=563.76s)]
*  not just with these terrorists, but with everything that they're doing, that they don't know what [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=569.36s)]
*  they're doing. They're doing contradictory things and they're doing it in a way that is not [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=573.12s)]
*  considering the harms that they're creating. Whether the American public is going to just [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=577.2s)]
*  breathe a sigh of relief now or they're going to remember this and think, oh my gosh, he erased [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=581.2s)]
*  our retirement savings in a matter of a week and they're only partially back. I think that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=586.64s)]
*  is what the Democrats are going to have to try to capitalize on and I'm not sure they'll be able [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=591.76s)]
*  to do it yet. Yeah, I thought it was really interesting, Mariana. I don't know if you picked [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=595.84s)]
*  this up, that some of the opposition, I think in a way the more telling opposition to Donald Trump [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=599.68s)]
*  and the more worrying criticism of him for him didn't come from the Democrats. It came from these [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  brocasters, these people we've talked about in the past. There are loads of them. You know them [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=611.52s)]
*  better than I do, but these podcasters are often not very political but quite supportive of Trump [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  during the election. I saw one of them saying, man, why am I broke halfway through his podcast? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=622.2399999999999s)]
*  He looked at his 401k, his pension thing, which lots of Americans of course have on their phones. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=628.88s)]
*  Anthony keeps glancing nervously away from the camera and they look at his. You've got that kind [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=634.8s)]
*  of sense that actually in the Trumposphere or the wider Trumposphere, Mariana, there was also quite [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=639.68s)]
*  a lot of nervousness that probably counted for a bit more than poor old Chuck Schumer. Yeah, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=645.92s)]
*  and you think about not just the brocasters as you call them, the kind of like these podcasters, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=650.72s)]
*  alternative media outlets that were pretty instrumental really to Trump's election and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=656.48s)]
*  reaching sort of the average person who's maybe not so used to consuming what we'd call the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=662.32s)]
*  professional or the mainstream media these days. But then you've also got what we call the tech [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=667.44s)]
*  bros, the brolligarchy, whatever you want to term them. People like Elon Musk who made quite clear [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=673.52s)]
*  that they weren't necessarily very supportive of what was going on with the tariffs either. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=678.88s)]
*  So you've got this section of support that Donald Trump has succeeded in kind of bringing into his [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=684.0s)]
*  base suddenly saying, oh actually not so sure about this, particularly very wealthy, whether [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=688.64s)]
*  it's social media bosses or tech bosses more broadly or other very rich people saying, hang on [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  a second, I'm not sure that this is actually a very good thing. And you wonder to what extent [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=700.16s)]
*  that that exerted pressure on him or whether this was always the plan. I think that's sort of the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=704.72s)]
*  fundamental question, isn't it? Well, and will we discover Anthony by seeing who stays in the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=708.88s)]
*  White House now? I mean, has it come down to that? Because there was this huge argument, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=714.08s)]
*  wasn't a very public argument between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, the trade representative, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=717.12s)]
*  no the trade advisor as he is, I think his proper title is. So Navarro, I mean, it seems to me, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=722.56s)]
*  has just completely lost. He wanted these tariffs to remain, all the high ones, and they haven't. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=728.24s)]
*  And Scott Besson, as you were reminding us earlier on, the Treasury Secretary, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=733.12s)]
*  seeming pretty relieved by where they'd got to and suggesting that he wanted to be there [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=737.76s)]
*  all along. Does this mean that the bros, the powerful people, the very wealthy people, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  the backers of Donald Trump, both inside and outside the White House, the hedge fund managers, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=746.48s)]
*  the West Coast tech people, have they won? They certainly won a temporary victory. We may be [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=752.1600000000001s)]
*  doing this all again in 90 days when this pause ends up. We may be doing it again in 90 minutes, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=758.48s)]
*  Anthony. But Donald Trump, in his comments at the White House yesterday, talked about the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=764.08s)]
*  nervousness that people were getting, the yippies, and starting to get anxious. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=772.08s)]
*  And I think he may have been starting to get anxious because I think one of the things, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=777.6s)]
*  it wasn't the stock market tumbling, it wasn't the tech bros complaining, it was, as we talked [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=781.2800000000001s)]
*  about in the past, the bond market that was seriously dropping the yields on U.S. Treasuries [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=786.64s)]
*  were going up dramatically. And that is a real pressure point for governments, and that's a real [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=795.04s)]
*  pressure point for the American government because it makes the cost of borrowing, the cost of [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  issuing new Treasury notes much more expensive. So financing the massive debt that the United States [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=805.1999999999999s)]
*  has already becomes much, much more expensive. And if that goes sideways, the United States could [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=811.04s)]
*  be in very, very real trouble in a way that a stock market dip or complaints from within the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=817.52s)]
*  Republican Party or complaints from Mark Zuckerberg about how he might be overregulated by the EU just [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=823.28s)]
*  do not land the same way. And then this feeds into this wider debate, doesn't it, Anthony? Because [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=829.52s)]
*  while all of this was happening, I mean, so many other things are going on at the same time, but [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=835.92s)]
*  we ought to mention that they tried to pass a budget, didn't they? They tried to get this [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=839.84s)]
*  thing through Congress that Trump supports, where all the Republicans agree, because of course he's [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=844.32s)]
*  got a majority in both houses of Congress, all Republicans agree we're going to spend X amount [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=849.12s)]
*  of money, this is how we're going to fund the tax cuts at the end of the year, etc., etc., or the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=853.52s)]
*  continuing tax cuts. And it didn't get through because what, there are some Republicans who are [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=858.48s)]
*  worried, genuinely worried, aren't there, about spending, not just sort of rhetorically, oh, we [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=864.5600000000001s)]
*  ought to spend less, but they actually think that those things you've just mentioned potentially [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=869.28s)]
*  could end in a real existential crisis for the United States. Yeah, there are Republicans who [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=874.9599999999999s)]
*  are worried about runaway, in their view, federal spending, and the margins in the House of [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=880.64s)]
*  Representatives are so narrow, it only takes a handful of those Republicans to scuttle plans to [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=886.72s)]
*  pass any kind of a vote. That's what happened last night, they didn't even bring this budget resolution [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=892.0s)]
*  to the vote because Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, realized that it was going to go down [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=896.72s)]
*  in flames. You originally had the House of Representatives pass a much more aggressive [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=901.9200000000001s)]
*  tax cutting, spending cutting, proposal plan, outline, whatever you want to call it, that would [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=907.36s)]
*  be a framework for later negotiations and debates later this year. The Senate took their turn, they [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=913.52s)]
*  passed a different version, sent it back to the House, and now the House, these hardliners in the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=919.84s)]
*  House are balking at approving the Senate, the more moderate, more restrained, as far as spending [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=925.04s)]
*  cutting goes, Senate plan. And that's where we are today. And I will say there was something else they [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=931.28s)]
*  tried to tuck into that budget resolution, which was that would prevent a vote challenging Donald [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump's trade authority, that would prevent the House of Representatives from voting on revoking [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=941.36s)]
*  the emergency declaration that Donald Trump has used to justify all of these tariffs. So that didn't [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=947.04s)]
*  get through either, at least at the moment, but you can see there's the leadership in the House of [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=952.8s)]
*  Representatives trying to avoid an unpleasant vote to undermine Donald Trump on his trade policy. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=956.4s)]
*  One of the things that has been really, really popping up on the undercover voters, social media [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  feeds, my fictional characters with all their social media profiles across the main sites, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  and certainly the ones who don't like Donald Trump so much, is this kind of accusation of [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=972.3199999999999s)]
*  potential market manipulation that Donald Trump did this on purpose in order to benefit himself [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  or benefit his rich friends or invest in certain stocks and shares and then make loads of money out [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=984.64s)]
*  of it. And it certainly sort of has given a bit of, sort of, I don't know, a little bit of momentum [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=988.8s)]
*  really to that narrative, that look, Donald Trump is out for himself and out for the rich people and [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=995.52s)]
*  not out for you type thing. But it's definitely tended to be more so in the anti-Trump circles [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1000.88s)]
*  on social media, whereas the pro-Trump ones are kind of saying, oh, look at this, this is actually [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1006.96s)]
*  maybe a really wise strategy and, you know, this is how Donald Trump is really clever at business [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1010.88s)]
*  and the art of the deal and all that kind of stuff that he's sort of known for. And it's something [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1015.36s)]
*  that I imagine has been popping up on Americaster's own social media feeds because it's something we've [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1018.96s)]
*  had quite a few questions about. This is a voice note we've had from Fiona in Derby. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1023.52s)]
*  Hi, Americaster's, Fiona from Derby here. My question is, as President of the United States, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1028.64s)]
*  Trump is in a unique position to make decisions which can and have had a significant effect on [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1035.2s)]
*  the global economy. Is there any suggestion that President Trump has or could manipulate the [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1041.2s)]
*  markets for his own personal gain, for example, by short-selling stock and then deliberately [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1046.56s)]
*  causing the stock market to nosedive? And would this fall foul of the US Constitution's anti- [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1051.92s)]
*  corruption provisions or be otherwise illegal? Thank you. What do we reckon? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1057.28s)]
*  Well, there are laws against insider trading. They would be enforced by the Security and Exchange [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1062.56s)]
*  Commission, which is run by Donald Trump and his administration, his appointees. Obviously, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1068.32s)]
*  there was a lot of speculation around this because those were huge swings in the stock market, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1075.2s)]
*  eight, nine percent swings in the stock market. And if you had any kind of advanced knowledge [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1081.44s)]
*  that something that Donald Trump said or did was going to change that, you could profit greatly [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1085.76s)]
*  from that. And Donald Trump actually, at 9.30 yesterday morning, posted on Truth Social that [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1090.88s)]
*  now would be a good time to buy. And then just a few hours later, as we discussed, he issued that [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  statement that dramatically moved the stock market in a positive direction. So it would have been [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1102.72s)]
*  a good time to buy, which feeds fuel to these concerns as well. There are some people who have [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1108.96s)]
*  looked at some of the trading that went on right before. Donald Trump's announcement said there [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1114.48s)]
*  were some people who were predicting and positioning themselves to benefit from a [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1118.8s)]
*  stock market surge. Now, there have been no evidence that it's anyone connected to Donald [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1123.04s)]
*  Trump. It's no evidence that Donald Trump or his associates were involved in any kind of insider [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1127.52s)]
*  trading. But I mean, when you see these big kind of movements, there's going to be that kind of [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1133.28s)]
*  speculation. Yeah. And and America is a pretty concerned right across the world. So not only [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1137.04s)]
*  from Fiona in Derby, Marina in South London, Darren in Melbourne, Australia, Ian in Cumbernauld, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1145.44s)]
*  Scotland, Matthew in Massachusetts, Simon in Beckenham. I mean, the thing is, what people [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1150.72s)]
*  think when they look at Donald Trump and the way that he behaves more widely and you look at the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1157.76s)]
*  crypto stuff that he's been involved in is that this is not a president who adheres to the same [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1163.92s)]
*  standards as previous presidents. And that is a reasonable thing to think. And it's something as [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1169.92s)]
*  well, isn't it, Anthony, that the Democrats are openly saying, or at least some of them. Let's [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1174.64s)]
*  listen to Adam Schiff speaking on a video he uploaded just recently. So today, Trump removed [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1178.96s)]
*  many of the tariffs he had imposed in this on again, off again, it must be Wednesday, tariffs are off [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  again kind of policy. This has just wreaked havoc on the markets, of course. But there is another [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1192.64s)]
*  profound danger as well. And that is insider trading within the White House within the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1199.28s)]
*  administration. You may have seen early in the day Trump tweet this. Now, this is a good time to buy. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1204.96s)]
*  So the question is, between that tweet and Donald Trump's announcement that he was reducing the [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1211.92s)]
*  tariffs on most other nations apart from China, the question is, who knew what the president was [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1217.76s)]
*  going to do? And did people around the president trade stock knowing the incredible [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1223.44s)]
*  gyration the market was about to go through? Because look, this is a president who is trading [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1229.6000000000001s)]
*  in his own meme coin, even as he's president, his kids are trading in their own cryptocurrency. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1234.4s)]
*  You've got people like Elon Musk who are doing their own conflicted self-dealing in the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1240.0s)]
*  administration. In any administration this corrupt, it is more than necessary to ask, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1244.88s)]
*  were people personally profiting from insider information while people's savings, their [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1251.4399999999998s)]
*  retirement accounts were being torched? So we're writing to the White House to demand answers. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1257.04s)]
*  Now, I am fully cognizant of the fact that the White House is probably the last place to be [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1263.12s)]
*  forthcoming about this or any other corruption in the administration. We in Congress need to do more [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1267.36s)]
*  than demand answers. We need to do the oversight necessary to get those answers. I have to say, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1273.76s)]
*  Anthony, I listen to that and I think, yes, to a kind of cool, calm, old style political operative [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1279.04s)]
*  in the United States, they might say I'm outraged. I just think to Trump supporters, they see him as [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1288.1599999999999s)]
*  a rich guy who has a lot of fun. And again and again, when he's been called out on these things, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1293.68s)]
*  and my goodness, he has been called out through the ages, indeed, long before he was president [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1299.36s)]
*  as well. And there's all that baggage around him. I just can't see for the Democrats that this really [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1304.72s)]
*  works. Is that right? I mean, I guess the question is, are people who look at this and see, okay, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1310.4s)]
*  well, these movements, clearly there's room for someone to profit in it if they knew ahead of [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1316.5600000000002s)]
*  time. It's not just harmless, though. It's affecting my retirement savings. It's affecting the price of [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1321.3600000000001s)]
*  the consumer goods that I buy. If they start to feel that pain and they feel like someone else's [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1327.92s)]
*  profiting from that pain, I mean, that gets at the heart of Donald Trump's message, right? I mean, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1334.4s)]
*  that the elites are out to get you and they're getting a better deal than you are. So if that [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1339.2800000000002s)]
*  belief sets in and people do start hurting economically because of things that Donald Trump [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1344.96s)]
*  is directly doing, then I think there's a great risk for Donald Trump that it could come back to [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1351.0400000000002s)]
*  bite him or, I mean, Donald Trump doesn't have to stand for election anymore. It would come back [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1355.76s)]
*  and bite the Republican Party in the elections this November here in Virginia and elsewhere, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1359.6s)]
*  and then the midterm congressional elections next year. So I think there's very real risk for him. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1364.8799999999999s)]
*  It's interesting because it's some of that messaging and videos from the Democrats that's [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1371.9199999999998s)]
*  popped up on the anti-Trump supporters social media profiles that I've been analyzing. But to [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1376.1599999999999s)]
*  this point about it kind of reaching perhaps the sort of on the fence, undecided, could change [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1381.36s)]
*  their mind about Trump voter. I haven't seen it cutting through in quite the same way that all [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1386.72s)]
*  this stuff was around, oh my gosh, look, everything's losing value. And I think to your point, Anthony, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  it's kind of that. It's like when people feel the real impact of it or if they feel the real [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1395.76s)]
*  impact of it themselves, that's when the people who aren't kind of in the filter bubble that is, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1399.6000000000001s)]
*  for example, very much leaning Democrat will start to think, oh, I'm not so sure about this. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1405.6000000000001s)]
*  The other thing that's kind of interesting, isn't it, is the gap or the kind of incompatibility of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1410.16s)]
*  the messaging that Donald Trump is both unleashing chaos and therefore suggesting a level of it's out [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1416.4s)]
*  of control, he doesn't know what he's doing, but then also suggesting that he's deliberately [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1422.3200000000002s)]
*  manipulating the market and therefore he does know what he's doing. I don't know, those two [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1426.3200000000002s)]
*  messages feel like they don't necessarily go together. The thing is people like the energy, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1429.6000000000001s)]
*  people who support him like the energy and they contrast it with Joe Biden. And obviously it is [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1434.8000000000002s)]
*  a huge contrast, the question about that. And if they think that it's all going, broadly speaking, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1439.68s)]
*  in the right direction, I reckon they'll stick with him. But it's interesting to look at the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1446.0s)]
*  most recent polls, isn't it, Anthony? On the economy, the great margin that he had over Joe Biden, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1449.68s)]
*  the huge kind of difference between them, the enormous feeling that the Trump economy was going [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1456.48s)]
*  to be a great economy, that's kind of gone, hasn't it? There are still all sorts of poll things that [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1461.04s)]
*  worry the Democrats, including their extraordinary unpopularity, 60% unpopularity rate. But for Trump [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1466.16s)]
*  himself, if you're looking for warning signs, they are there. Yeah, his approval rating has dipped. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1473.12s)]
*  And as you mentioned, his handling of the economy, which used to be his strength, has turned negative [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1479.04s)]
*  here as well. And these were polls taken over the past week, but before or not fully encapsulating [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1484.3999999999999s)]
*  the fallout from his trade decisions. But when they do ask about his trade policy, that is polling [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1490.6399999999999s)]
*  right now in the 30% approval rating margin, that area, which is not good at all. So that might be [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  another factor in Donald Trump's decision to back away from this a little bit. It was wildly unpopular, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1502.4s)]
*  although the Trump administration will circulate internal polls that they have of working class [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1508.5600000000002s)]
*  Americans that show that the trade policy is being widely viewed as a positive thing, and that they [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1513.8400000000001s)]
*  support him. And working class voters are what Donald Trump says this is all about. So they may [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1521.44s)]
*  believe they still have ground to stand on. But that then goes to the kind of incoherence of the [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1527.76s)]
*  whole thing, doesn't it? Either you have these tariffs and you re-sure all these industries and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1532.08s)]
*  you start kind of, I don't know, making shoes and all the other stuff, and indeed cars and not [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1537.4399999999998s)]
*  offshoring any of that, or you don't. I mean, either these tariffs do the job that at least [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1546.0s)]
*  was claimed they were going to do, or maybe they don't do that job. And then America is still, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1551.04s)]
*  as they would see it, stuck in a place, albeit most economists will say, is a rather good place [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1556.3999999999999s)]
*  because you're doing high margin, high value manufacturing. What's not to like about that? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1561.36s)]
*  But they don't like that. And they have some coherent reasons why they don't like that. It [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1565.9199999999998s)]
*  seems to me that either you do it or you don't do it. And at some stage, someone among their [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1569.9199999999998s)]
*  supporters is going to say, what's going on? And going back and forth and changing it left and [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1575.9199999999998s)]
*  right, I mean, that does not provide the kind of predictability, the kind of stability necessary [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1580.24s)]
*  for companies to decide, okay, their tariffs are going to be there. I'm going to ramp up [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  production and build factories here in the United States because I know that I'm going to have an [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1589.36s)]
*  advantage compared to foreign importers because of these tariffs. We have a saying in Texas about [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1594.08s)]
*  if you don't like the weather, just wait five minutes. I could say the same thing about [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1600.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's trade policy right now. It's changing seemingly on a dime every few minutes. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1603.6s)]
*  Okay. So we have been asking about our youngest and oldest America-asters because we've had some [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1609.04s)]
*  really nice messages in about people who are quite little listening to America-Cast and deciding [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1616.24s)]
*  what makes you an America-Caster and when. And we thought we might not be able to beat [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1623.04s)]
*  four weeks old, which one four week old has been listening to us somehow. But we got this from [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1627.6s)]
*  Lida in Prague who says, I just finished listening to the latest episode with my five day old son. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1634.48s)]
*  He shamelessly fell asleep right after you stopped talking about penguins. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1641.1200000000001s)]
*  Penguins. And he has experienced a whole lot of changes to tariffs in his lifetime, hasn't he? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1645.2s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say exactly that's the thing, isn't it? For children who get bored easily with [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1650.64s)]
*  stuff, particularly the young ones, you need to keep, you know, shiny things in front of them and [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1656.96s)]
*  lots of kind of oohs and ahs and all that. We provide it. I don't think it's us providing it, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1663.2s)]
*  if we're honest with ourselves. I think it kind of is actually in a way. We provide the entertainment [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1669.2s)]
*  around the main guy and they're going to wait. I mean, it's an experiment on a whole generation [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1673.52s)]
*  of youth, isn't it? They're going to. This is politics to them. This is how people normally [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1678.24s)]
*  behave to make a semi-serious point. My goodness, what a generation they'll be. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1682.8799999999999s)]
*  I hope his first word is not tariffs, though. That would be a bit of disappointment, wouldn't it? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1687.68s)]
*  And clearly we need to have more penguin content. So I think we're going to have to try to do that. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1692.0s)]
*  Whenever we mentioned Elon Musk, we also have to mention penguins somehow. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1696.56s)]
*  Penguin klaxon. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1700.4s)]
*  That's it. To all of you, however old you are, bye-bye. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1702.24s)]
*  Bye. Bye, y'all. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1705.6s)]
*  That's all we've got time for today. You can find all of our episodes on BBC Sounds. Bye-bye. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WaPgHb1D8&t=1706.8s)]
