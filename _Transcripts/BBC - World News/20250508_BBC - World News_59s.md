# What are you hoping for from the new pope? #Pope #Conclave #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg)
*  I'm here to see the white smoke. Let's make it happen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=0.0s)]
*  I come from Bologna actually, but I'm here in Rome studying. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=2.2s)]
*  I can see you're studying right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=5.4s)]
*  Yes! [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=7.2s)]
*  Hopefully he'll be a good Pope. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=8.6s)]
*  I would like him to be very forward with the world policies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=10.4s)]
*  So, we left Lyon at around 4am, at 5am in the car. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  And after 7 or 8 hours of driving, when we had passed Florence, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  we had a small car accident. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=23.2s)]
*  So did you leave the car there so you could come here? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=25.8s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. We left the car. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=29.4s)]
*  It's very difficult, especially with having traditional Catholic values [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=32.4s)]
*  to fit into modern-day society. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=36.0s)]
*  Somebody who can open the church to everybody. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=38.4s)]
*  Follow the steps that Pope Francis was taking, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=40.6s)]
*  for a world with more peace, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=44.2s)]
*  that continues to follow with a lot of prayer, with a lot of peace, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=46.2s)]
*  for everyone, regardless of religion, race, color, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=51.2s)]
*  everything that Jesus preached. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCmekEFplg&t=56.6s)]
