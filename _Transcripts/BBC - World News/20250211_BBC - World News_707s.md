# Israel says ceasefire ends if hostage release delayed | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s)
*  When he came here to Washington last week, Benjamin Netanyahu was happy to hear the plan for Gaza that Donald Trump set out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=0.0s)]
*  And since then, the Israelis have appeared to be following Donald Trump's messaging on the conflict. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=7.0s)]
*  Tonight, the Prime Minister echoed the same threat Donald Trump had issued on Monday from the Oval Office. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=12.0s)]
*  Unless all hostages are released by lunchtime Saturday, then the ceasefire will be over and the war will resume. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=17.0s)]
*  In light of Hamas' announcement of its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=24.0s)]
*  last night I ordered the military to gather forces inside and around the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=31.0s)]
*  This operation is being carried out at this time. It will be completed in the very near future. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=37.0s)]
*  The decision that I passed unanimously in the Cabinet is this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=43.0s)]
*  If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=47.0s)]
*  the ceasefire will end and the military will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=51.0s)]
*  We'll get to Joel and Jake in a second to discuss the politics around all this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=59.0s)]
*  But first, let's get a state of play from Mikey Kay on what the Israelis might be thinking of, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=64.0s)]
*  because we've seen the enormous destruction, Mikey, that there is in Gaza. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=69.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's talked about it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=73.0s)]
*  If you were in the targeting cell in the IDF right now, what's the plan? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=75.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, first thing I've got to say is I have been in a targeting cell before, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=81.0s)]
*  and the rules that the IDF are running by are quite different to the rules that we would run by in terms of rules of engagement and collateral damage estimate. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=84.0s)]
*  But effectively inside that targeting cell, you'll have intelligence coming in, three types of intelligence, mainly human intelligence from informants, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=92.0s)]
*  imagery intelligence from predators looking down and then electronic intelligence. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=100.0s)]
*  So tapping into phone calls and listening into what effectively Hamas are doing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=105.0s)]
*  All that intelligence will be coming into the targeting cell. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=110.0s)]
*  And then from that, they'll get a number of targets in terms of locations where they'll be. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=113.0s)]
*  And then they'll put a priority order on what those targets are. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=118.0s)]
*  They've got capabilities dropping precision guided munitions. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=121.0s)]
*  When we used to do this, it was a huge process of CDE collateral damage estimate. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=124.0s)]
*  Collateral damage estimate basically is using partner life and all the intelligence to work out how you minimize collateral. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=130.0s)]
*  The UK, for example, has a very, very, very high tolerance to collateral. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=137.0s)]
*  So, you know, it won't drop a bomb if it thinks civilians are going to get killed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=142.0s)]
*  Now, what we've what we've got here is we've got 70 percent of Gaza already destroyed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=146.0s)]
*  You've got Hamas depleted to quite minimal levels. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=151.0s)]
*  And then you have refugees, internally displaced people now flooding back into the areas that have been destroyed in their tens, if not hundreds of thousands. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=156.0s)]
*  So you have this predicament where if the idea of restart this, they're going to start targeting Hamas could be the tunnels, hundreds of kilometers of tunnels underneath Gaza. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=168.0s)]
*  But a lot of them are already taken out through the dropping of apartment blocks, et cetera. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=178.0s)]
*  So you've got that conundrum. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=182.0s)]
*  And then you've got all these civilians coming back in who are trying to look for their homes, rebuild their homes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=184.0s)]
*  And so the usual protocol is the idea will say there's a target in this area. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=191.0s)]
*  Leave in the months that have gone by, the idea of leaflet areas that they are going to target or they've sent out messages on cell phones. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=196.0s)]
*  Presumably they would do that again. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=207.0s)]
*  But why does the messaging that they're getting from the White House now affect what goes on on the battlefield? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=209.0s)]
*  Well, that's the that's the number one game changer between now and before the ceasefire was called before the ceasefire was called. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=216.0s)]
*  Donald Trump wasn't calling for the US to basically go in and rebuild it into Trump Tower. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=225.0s)]
*  But now they are. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=232.0s)]
*  So if you're a Garza and going back to your where your home was, irrespective of whether it's rubble or it's partially standing or still standing, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=234.0s)]
*  and then you get leaflet saying you've got to leave because we're targeting this area. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=243.0s)]
*  So, you know, I mean, of course, they're not going to leave because if they leave, they know they're never get they're never going to go back again. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=247.0s)]
*  You know, and so this is whole new conundrum now of minimal target minimum Hamas targets, maximum civility, civilians. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=254.0s)]
*  And so the potential here for collateral damage and more civilians being killed is, I would say, even greater than it was. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=263.0s)]
*  Mikey, thanks for that. Joel, that's a really interesting military dynamic to what is going on in the region. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=269.0s)]
*  But, of course, now we've got the politics as well overlaid. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=275.0s)]
*  There's a lot of brinkmanship going on here between Hamas and the Israeli government. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=278.0s)]
*  But as Mikey says, the messaging that's coming from the White House is not unconnected to what might now unfold on the battlefield. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=284.0s)]
*  Absolutely not, Christian. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=294.0s)]
*  And I think we still are hearing the shockwaves of the stunning announcement from a week ago where President Trump essentially told the world that he wanted the United States to control Gaza. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=296.0s)]
*  And to displace two million Palestinians immediately and without authorization, without money, without a plan. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=307.0s)]
*  I can go on and on about the dynamics of that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=314.0s)]
*  But what it's done is it's effectively thrown a wrench in the ongoing ceasefire. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=316.0s)]
*  Now, that was what the president was supposed to be discussing with the prime minister last week and how to keep the ceasefire going. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=322.0s)]
*  This stage two period that we're currently in that has a few more weeks left. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=328.0s)]
*  And then, of course, to begin the phase three, the end state and have a negotiation on that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=332.0s)]
*  He just kind of blew it up. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=338.0s)]
*  And now we're seeing the results, which is there is nobody overseeing the ceasefire negotiations that has credibility right now. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=340.0s)]
*  And it's collapsing before our eyes. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=347.0s)]
*  Joe, I actually want to take a closer look at that because we saw this interesting interplay today between the King of Jordan, King Abdullah, who was at the White House and Donald Trump. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=349.0s)]
*  And we know that the King of Jordan has said he and Egypt reject Donald Trump's plans to buy or own Gaza and to resettle Palestinians there. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=358.0s)]
*  And at the same time, Jordan today saying that they will take in two thousand sick Palestinian children. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=368.0s)]
*  That doesn't appear to have shifted Donald Trump's message, though, on Gaza. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=374.0s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=377.0s)]
*  We're not going to buy anything. We're going to have it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=378.0s)]
*  We're going to keep it. And we're going to make sure that there's going to be peace and there's not going to be any problem. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=380.0s)]
*  And nobody's going to question it. And we're going to run it very properly. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=386.0s)]
*  And eventually we'll have economic development at a very large scale, maybe the largest scale on that site. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=391.0s)]
*  And we'll have lots of good things built there, including hotels and office buildings and housing and other things. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=397.0s)]
*  And we'll make that site into what it should be. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=404.0s)]
*  Jake, no buy in from the region, from Egypt to Jordan, of course. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=408.0s)]
*  What do you make of Donald Trump doubling down on these comments? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=412.0s)]
*  Well, there's a short term issue here in terms of the ceasefire and the return of hostages. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=417.0s)]
*  We need to mention this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=423.0s)]
*  The return of hostages and the terrible conditions that we've seen so far that the folks have been enduring. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=425.0s)]
*  President Trump initiated the call for Saturday at noon. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=430.0s)]
*  You saw Prime Minister Netanyahu back that statement up. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=435.0s)]
*  It's critically important in terms of what's going to take place there. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=439.0s)]
*  You know, you saw Secretary of State Marco Rubio say if you have a better idea, now is the time for that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=445.0s)]
*  Arab leaders are going to meet in Egypt later this month. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=452.0s)]
*  And if there's a better idea out there, then it needs to come forward. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=455.0s)]
*  I think what you see here is President Trump offering a new idea, a new solution to a many decades old problem that no one else has been able to solve. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=459.0s)]
*  And so I think that this puts Arab leaders throughout the Middle East in a position to step up. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=469.0s)]
*  They're forced to come up with ideas. They're forced to take some responsibility in this circumstance. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=476.0s)]
*  Hold on, Jake. Just can I jump in there, Jake? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=480.0s)]
*  This idea that Donald Trump is presenting flies in the face of international law. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=482.0s)]
*  Well, listen, there is without question a lot of anxiety about what he has said throughout the international community, even within the United States. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=490.0s)]
*  A lot of surprise at the announcement that he made. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=498.0s)]
*  But I think the effect of what he is saying is going to cause nations in the Middle East to take a step up, which is necessary to solve this problem in the end. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=501.0s)]
*  I think you see the president in his first administration with the Abraham Accords make tremendous progress for peace in the Middle East. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=511.0s)]
*  I think that is his intention now to continue that peace process. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=519.0s)]
*  And as I said before, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has an open ear to new ideas about how to solve this problem and how to take responsibility, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=524.0s)]
*  because ultimately we have to stop the killing and we need to make sure that Hamas is not in a position to attack Israel ever again. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=533.0s)]
*  Joe? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=542.0s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, Christian, Sumi, the congressman, with all due respect, this is not a plan or an idea. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=543.0s)]
*  There is no process being described. I concur. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=550.0s)]
*  The hostages need to come out and there is an actual ceasefire process underway right now that the president allegedly supports. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=553.0s)]
*  But what he's doing right now is destroying American credibility in the region. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=560.0s)]
*  He's undermining our word. He's making our allies with whom we have deep partnerships on security issues, intelligence cooperation, economic trade. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=564.0s)]
*  He's making them incredibly nervous about what is going on inside the White House. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=573.0s)]
*  And if I were them, I'd be looking over my shoulder right now in terms of the aid. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=579.0s)]
*  Will the aid packages continue to Egypt and Jordan? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=584.0s)]
*  And if that's the case and if it's called into question, will they now look to our adversaries, China in particular, as a more stable ally? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=587.0s)]
*  Because this White House is not projecting stability. It's destabilizing the politics of the region. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=595.0s)]
*  Jake, this statement we've had from Prime Minister Netanyahu is almost word for word what we heard from the president in the Oval Office last night. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=600.0s)]
*  Do you think that makes the hostages safer? Do you think it it opens up the possibility really that all the hostages are coming out? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=607.0s)]
*  Because I look at it and I think the hostages are the only leverage that Hamas has left. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=614.0s)]
*  I think that it I think it is more likely that the hostages, all of the hostages, will be released. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=620.0s)]
*  And no question, this is making countries in the region that we have military relationships with, like Jordan, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=627.0s)]
*  it's giving them some anxiety and some pause. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=635.0s)]
*  I think the president's position on this and I think the way most Americans that share his party view this is that he is trying to motivate people to step up to the table [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=638.0s)]
*  and propose solutions to take some responsibility for what the future looks like. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=649.0s)]
*  Because what we've seen over the past, with respect, in this last administration was not a stable or safe world. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=654.0s)]
*  It was a world where American leadership was questioned. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=661.0s)]
*  It was unreliable. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=665.0s)]
*  And you saw whether it was in Ukraine or in Israel, a lot of strife break open over the last four years. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=666.0s)]
*  And so I think we should be I think we should have some level of pause at judgment for what President Trump is doing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=674.0s)]
*  And let's see what happens. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=682.0s)]
*  As I mentioned, Arab leaders are going to come together. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=683.0s)]
*  Let's see what solutions come out of this. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=685.0s)]
*  Yeah, they did indeed say that in due time they will present a considered proposal that would be perhaps a counter to what Donald Trump is proposing. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=688.0s)]
*  But we'll be watching that closely, of course, as the ceasefire agreement hangs in the balance. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YA7SLTGr-s&t=696.0s)]
