# Marc Fogel welcomed by Donald Trump after release from Russia | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo)
*  Hello, welcome. The American teacher Mark Fogel has been greeted by President Trump at the White House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=0.0s)]
*  after being freed by Russia. We're going to show you some images of that, but just to warn you [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  beforehand, they do include many flashing images. Mr. Fogel had been detained in Russia since 2021. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=11.44s)]
*  He met President Trump shortly after landing in the US as part of that exchange deal between the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=18.56s)]
*  two countries, although further details of that have not been released. Mr. Fogel was given a 14 [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=23.76s)]
*  year sentence for illegal cannabis possession after he was found carrying medical marijuana [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=30.8s)]
*  he'd been prescribed in the United States. Well, President Trump said that another person would [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  be released on Wednesday, but didn't say who it would be. Well, our correspondent, Helena Humphrey, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  has been following this story from Washington. Draped in these stars and stripes, American flag, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=46.72s)]
*  Mark Fogel appeared elated as he touched down at Joint Base Andrews just outside of Washington, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=53.28s)]
*  D.C. And from there, it was swiftly on to the White House, where he was greeted by President [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=59.28s)]
*  Donald Trump on a snowy south lawn. And inside one of the diplomatic reception rooms, Mark Fogel [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=64.64s)]
*  described what he had endured in a Russian prison for the past three and a half years, as difficult, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=71.6s)]
*  challenging, tough, but said that he didn't want to go into more details at the moment, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=78.48s)]
*  but instead pay tribute to Donald Trump and his efforts to secure his release. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=83.12s)]
*  I feel like the luckiest man on earth right now. And [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=88.64s)]
*  I want you to know that I am not a hero in this at all. And President Trump is a hero. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=96.64s)]
*  Mark Fogel also paid tribute to his 95-year-old mother, someone he said had energetically [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=105.6s)]
*  campaigned for his freedom, including holding a backstage meeting with Donald Trump during his [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=112.64s)]
*  rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, before that assassination attempt on Donald Trump, because [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=119.2s)]
*  he said that he believed and his mother believed that the Biden administration hadn't been doing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=126.08s)]
*  enough to secure his freedom. It's worth keeping in mind that Mark Fogel was detained by Russian [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=131.04s)]
*  authorities in 2021. It wasn't until 2024 that the Biden administration declared his detention [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=137.04s)]
*  as wrongful. Take a listen to what President Trump had to say about those efforts from Mark [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=144.88s)]
*  Fogel's mother. He's got a great mother. And when I saw the mother at a rally, she said, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  would you if you win, would you get my son out? And I promise she's 95 years old. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  And I said, we'll get him out. And we got him out pretty quickly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=163.52s)]
*  Another development that we had coming out of that press conference is that Donald Trump [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=168.24s)]
*  also said what a number of US officials had been saying throughout the course of the day, that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=172.4s)]
*  another American hostage would be released on Wednesday without giving further details [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=177.28s)]
*  as to whom or from where. But the bigger picture in all of this and the questions being raised is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=182.88s)]
*  what does this mean for US ties and relations with Russia? Donald Trump was asked about what he had [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=189.68s)]
*  given in exchange for the release of Mark Fogel. He simply replied, not much. We haven't yet heard [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=197.6s)]
*  further details from the Kremlin. But Donald Trump did say that he believed that this could be a step [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  towards the end of Russia's war on Ukraine. And of course, Ukraine and President Zelensky and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=209.84s)]
*  Ukrainians will be watching this very closely because the concern is on the part of the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=217.36s)]
*  Ukrainians that with Donald Trump's desire to see a swift end to that war, they could face [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=222.32s)]
*  increased pressure to make territorial concessions that they don't want to make. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=228.8s)]
*  Yeah. And we'll hear what Volodymyr Zelensky has been saying just in a moment. But first, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=234.08s)]
*  our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, has been explaining more about those events that led to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=238.0s)]
*  this surprise release of Mark Fogel by the Kremlin. Mark Fogel had taught history at an [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=243.68s)]
*  international school here. He'd been arrested in 2021 at Moscow airport. He was found to be in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=251.76s)]
*  possession of 17 grams of marijuana. He said doctors had prescribed that. His punishment was [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=258.32s)]
*  14-year prison sentence. Suddenly today, Donald Trump's Middle East envoy flies to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=264.8s)]
*  Moscow to secure Mark Fogel's release, manages to do so. And then later, Donald Trump's national [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=272.88s)]
*  security advisor issues a statement, quite an interesting one, saying this, that the Trump [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  administration had negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=285.04s)]
*  and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the war in Ukraine. Two interesting things [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  about that, this talk about an exchange, we have no details at all for whom or for what Mark Fogel [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=297.44s)]
*  was exchanged. And it's interesting that the release of a US prisoner and the war in Ukraine [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  are mentioned in the same paragraph. Amid all the talk now of possible peace talks on Ukraine, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=310.0s)]
*  an imminent US peace plan, a sign of a US-Russia thaw, this kind of language about a show of good [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=316.72s)]
*  faith from the Russians and moving in the right direction to end the war, I think in Kiev they'll [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  be quite wary of this and wondering whether moving in the right direction means moving in the right [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=330.48s)]
*  direction for Moscow. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA88ce_yoVo&t=336.56s)]
