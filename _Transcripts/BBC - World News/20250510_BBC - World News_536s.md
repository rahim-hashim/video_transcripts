Video Description: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer joined world leaders to put pressure on Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Ukraine.
 
He and the other leaders are using the visit to urge Russia to "agree a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire" - a proposal initially made by US President Donald Trump.
 
The leaders' decision to travel to Kyiv together is a deliberately symbolic response to the more than 20 leaders who joined President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for Russia's Victory Day commemorations on Friday.
 
The leaders also vowed to "ratchet up pressure on Russia's war machine".

# UK PM Starmer joins world leaders in Ukraine to call for ceasefire | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4)
*  The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland have agreed on Saturday to an unconditional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=0.0s)]
*  30-day ceasefire from the 12th of May with the backing of Donald Trump. They also threatened [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=5.0s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin with new massive sanctions if he failed to comply. The announcement [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=10.72s)]
*  was made by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland and Ukraine after a meeting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=15.92s)]
*  in Kiev during which they held a phone call with Mr Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  As we've been reporting, Sakir Starmer was among the leaders who went to Kiev to meet [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=23.92s)]
*  President Zelensky. Our chief political correspondent Henry Zeffman also went to Ukraine and he [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=29.12s)]
*  spoke to the Prime Minister. Here's what they said. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Prime Minister, we saw yesterday in Russia the leaders of China, Brazil, even an EU leader [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=38.0s)]
*  from Slovakia line up with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. To what extent was you coming here [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=43.28s)]
*  with European leaders today a direct response to that? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=49.64s)]
*  Well, it was a hugely important symbolic day here in Kiev because, as you say, there was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=52.96s)]
*  a propaganda exercise in Moscow yesterday. Today we're able to demonstrate that Europe [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=58.72s)]
*  stands with Ukraine. You had the UK represented France, Germany, Poland and, of course, here [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=65.32s)]
*  with President Zelensky and many others that joined the call virtually. So 80 years on [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=72.72s)]
*  from VE Day, it was really important that we were here today. We actually made material [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=78.88s)]
*  progress in relation to a ceasefire, so that is an extremely good outcome. But it was also [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=83.92s)]
*  important to demonstrate that the values that underpinned what was being fought for 80 years [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=89.36s)]
*  ago were the same values now, that we will step up and play our part to preserve the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=94.96s)]
*  peace and bring about that ceasefire. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=100.0s)]
*  It's an impressive show of unity, no doubt, but Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=101.84s)]
*  has already said shove these peace plans. So aren't they just another act of symbolism? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=106.8s)]
*  Well, we haven't seen unity like this pretty well throughout the conflict. So to get the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=112.2s)]
*  European allies, US, New Zealand, Canada, all on one page, Putin, of course, cannot [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=118.2s)]
*  be trusted. But this now is a unified call for an unconditional ceasefire, backed up [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=129.2s)]
*  by sanctions. Now, there are sanctions in place at the moment. They're already having [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=134.6s)]
*  an impact on the Russian economy. So by further coordinating sanctions on oil, on fossil fuels, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=138.64s)]
*  et cetera, will make a material difference. So you've got unity in the demand, but also [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=145.64s)]
*  unity in what the response will be if the demand is not met. We haven't seen that sort [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=152.04s)]
*  of unity during this conflict. And I'm really pleased that we've been able to bring people [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  together in this way for what feels, I think, for all parties concerned, to be a really [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=161.27999999999997s)]
*  significant moment. And do all those parties include President Trump? Obviously, you had [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=167.64s)]
*  him on Emmanuel Macron's speakerphone earlier. Is he growing increasingly exasperated with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=172.2s)]
*  President Putin? I think it's important to appreciate that it was President Trump that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=177.44s)]
*  first made the proposal for the 30-day unconditional ceasefire. President Zelensky signed up to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=180.92s)]
*  that two months ago. And we spoke to President Trump after our meeting here. And I'm absolutely [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=186.48s)]
*  clear that we're aligned in relation to this. In relation to his relationship with President [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  Putin, well, he will better describe it than me. But I do think that he's absolutely clear [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  that this is a demand that must be met. You've nudged him some way, haven't you? You personally [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=205.44s)]
*  have. Well, look, I think collectively, we've been engaged with President Trump and his [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  team for some time. We're constantly in touch with them. But what matters to me is not who [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  moved who, but actually have we been able collectively to get to a much better position [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  and a unified position today that holds out a better prospect of a ceasefire, which is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=228.88s)]
*  desperately needed? Nobody wants a ceasefire more than Ukrainians who've paid a terrible [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=234.24s)]
*  price for the conflict over the last three plus years. Have we got a step closer to that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=238.56s)]
*  Yes, of course. You know, I'm not going to pretend this is the end of the process, but [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=243.32s)]
*  this is a significant moment. We need now to push on and make sure this happens. As [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  you say, the war has been going on here for more than three years. I think people see [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=253.56s)]
*  the Middle East and they see a situation there which only seems to be going worse. People [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=259.32s)]
*  will be concerned about India and Pakistan. I think a lot of people watch the news in [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  Britain and they get scared about the state of the world. Do you feel scared about the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=266.56s)]
*  state of the world? Well, I do think that across the country there is a concern about [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=271.24s)]
*  the instability around the world and people are talking more about that instability. We [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=277.16s)]
*  are living in a more uncertain world and we're in a different era on defence and security. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=281.92s)]
*  I think that what that requires is leadership is stepping up, pulling countries together. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=287.12s)]
*  That's why President Macron and I put together the coalition of the willing to show that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  Europe would step up and play our part because I feel very strongly that we shouldn't only [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=298.44000000000005s)]
*  commemorate and celebrate what happened 80 years ago. Our task is to remember the lessons [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=304.6s)]
*  of 80 years ago and we now have to step up to leadership positions to make sure that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=310.56s)]
*  for decades to come people enjoy the peace that I've enjoyed during my lifetime. There's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=315.44s)]
*  a real sense that we must now play our part and I'm determined that the United Kingdom [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  will be leading on that. Does the state of the world keep you up at night? No, it doesn't [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=326.54s)]
*  because it's really important that I focus on what I can do, bringing people together, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=330.36s)]
*  making significant steps today, making sure we're preparing with Ukraine what might happen [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=336.12s)]
*  next because if there is a ceasefire, I don't have to respond very, very quickly because [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=341.36s)]
*  what I don't want to see is a ceasefire that lasts a matter of days or weeks or months. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=346.24s)]
*  We need a lasting peace and that is really important not just in Ukraine but for everybody [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  in the United Kingdom because these conflicts have direct impact on the lives of working [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=357.44s)]
*  people in Britain. I'm very, very alive to that. They've seen their prices go up, their [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=363.08s)]
*  energy bill goes up so the more we can do to play our part in stabilising the world, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=367.44s)]
*  the better it is for working people in Britain and so I understand the concern and the anxiety [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=373.76s)]
*  people have about what is going on around the world. My job is to make sure our country [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  is safe and secure and play my part in ensuring that we de-escalate, bring about peace wherever [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=384.56s)]
*  we can and therefore improve the lives of working people in Britain. Thank you very [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=390.96s)]
*  much. Thank you. Mr Keir Starmer speaking to Henry Zeffelin, our correspondent Joe Inwood [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=395.64s)]
*  is here. The ball now in Moscow is called. And they have said that the ball can be, as [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=401.12s)]
*  Henry pointed out, inserted somewhere I think is the polite way of putting it. They were [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=406.36s)]
*  not that impressed so it seems. That's Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman. He has essentially [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=411.24s)]
*  said this is not going to fly. I think it was Medvedev, the former president who said [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=416.44s)]
*  where it could be inserted. And the general tone that we're getting from Moscow is, well [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=423.0s)]
*  look, what we have are preconditions and those preconditions, one of the ones they've set [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=429.48s)]
*  already is no more European arm shipments and then maybe we can talk. But they've always [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=433.08s)]
*  had a large number of preconditions and I don't think anything we've seen today is [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=439.54s)]
*  going to change that. I think the really crucial thing that we need to look for out of this [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=443.86s)]
*  event and it is fair to say this is symbolically important. This is a way of mirroring the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=447.98s)]
*  events we saw for Russia's Victory Day parade yesterday with a similar number or a large [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=452.98s)]
*  number of European leaders there offering their support to Ukraine. The other thing [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=457.54s)]
*  is it's Europe reinserting itself into this conversation because when Donald Trump came [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=461.62s)]
*  he essentially bypassed Europe. There weren't talks negotiated and discussions that didn't [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=466.1s)]
*  have any European leaders there. Europe has said no, we matter here and we're upping our [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=470.02s)]
*  defence spending as a consequence but what still matters is what the US says. Now I've [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=473.86s)]
*  just been looking at the social media feed of President Trump on his own Truth Social [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=477.46s)]
*  site and so far we've got lots of things being talked about but not this. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=482.54s)]
*  Yeah, and you wonder, is there a meaningful change in US approach? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=486.46s)]
*  I think when there has been a softening or changing of the language over the last few [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=492.1s)]
*  weeks we had of course just a quick timeline, we had that appallingly confrontational meeting [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=497.54s)]
*  between President Zelensky and Trump, things got a little better subsequently with that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=502.62s)]
*  meeting in the Vatican and there has been a softening of the language over the last [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=507.3s)]
*  couple of days, couple of weeks with JD Vance saying that America asked too much. Whether [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=511.7s)]
*  they're going to, and of course they also want this 30 day ceasefire, the one that the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=516.22s)]
*  Ukrainians have said they'll accept, the Europeans have said they'll accept, the American, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=519.7s)]
*  the Washington, the Americans have always said they'll accept that, so are they going [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=524.1800000000001s)]
*  to put pressure on to force the Russians or if they can to try and sign up to that, that's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=528.5400000000001s)]
*  what we really need to see. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=533.3000000000001s)]
*  Joe, for the moment, thank you, Joe. Inward. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXs0L2ocO4&t=534.3000000000001s)]
