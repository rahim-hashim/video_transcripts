# Have the Oscars fixed their diversity problem? - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0)
*  The superhero film Black Panther was one of 2018's biggest movies and much was made of its [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=0.0s)]
*  predominantly black cast. Aside from breaking the box office, it's also done something that no [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=7.2s)]
*  other comic book film has ever managed â€“ a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Another black-led film, Black Clansman, also got one. Race has become a major talking point [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=18.72s)]
*  at the Oscars in recent years. Remember the hashtag Oscars So White? It started being used [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  in 2015 and 2016 when there were no ethnic minority acting nominees for two years in a row. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=30.8s)]
*  In response, the Oscars organising body took steps to become more inclusive in its membership. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=38.24s)]
*  At first glance it seems that there has been a more diverse range of Best Picture nominees. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=44.56s)]
*  Movies like Lion, Hidden Figures, Get Out and Moonlight. But it's impossible to know for sure [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=50.08s)]
*  if this is because of changes made in 2016. However, the Oscars can be an easy target, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=56.64s)]
*  especially if film studios aren't making enough diverse movies to begin with. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=63.36s)]
*  All this of course applies to gender too. Over the last 10 years, when you look at the gender [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=68.4s)]
*  balance of films nominated for Best Picture, an overriding pattern emerges. But movies recognised [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=73.92s)]
*  at the Oscars usually feature prominent male characters. The Best Director category is even [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=80.56s)]
*  starker. In 90 years only one woman has ever won and just five in total have ever been nominated. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=86.72s)]
*  There are now multiple initiatives to address this, to ensure awards bodies have more choice. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  As year after year, only a tiny percentage of all films made have a female director. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=100.72s)]
*  And while looking at representation, the media advocacy body GLAAD has welcomed this year's record [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=107.76s)]
*  number of LGBTQ inclusive films among the Best Picture nominees, five of the eight. But whether [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=114.0s)]
*  all this is down to the changing makeup of the Academy, Hollywood's recognition of a need to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=121.2s)]
*  make more inclusive films or is simply a one-off anomaly is impossible to know. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=125.76s)]
*  And this brings us to the main issue. Oscar nominations still aren't representative, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=132.08s)]
*  at least partly because of the kind of films being widely produced. A problem that can only [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=137.44s)]
*  really be overcome when studios and independents start consistently making movies which truly [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=142.96s)]
*  reflect the audiences who pay to see them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opus9PSKmK0&t=149.92s)]
