Video Description: At least 14 people have been killed as Russian strikes hit several regions in Ukraine overnight, including Donetsk and Kharkiv, according to Ukrainian officials.
 
Eight residential buildings and an administrative building were also reportedly damaged following strikes in Dobropillya in Donetsk.
 
It comes after US President Donald Trump said he was "strongly considering" large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia, which he said is "absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield".
 
The US has also limited Ukraine's access to satellite imagery and paused military and intelligence aid.

# Wave of Russian strikes kill at least 14 and injure dozens, Ukraine says | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y)
*  There has been another wave of Russian air attacks on Ukraine overnight, with at least [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=0.0s)]
*  14 people killed. Most died in attacks on a town Dobropilie in the Donetsk region. Another [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=5.64s)]
*  three died in drone attacks in the Kharkiv region. These attacks came hours after the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=12.56s)]
*  United States confirmed that it had limited Ukraine's access to commercial satellite [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=17.56s)]
*  imagery as well as pausing military and intelligence aid. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=22.52s)]
*  Air strikes across Ukraine have intensified in the past week and they coincide with the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=27.08s)]
*  United States increasing pressure on President Zelensky to sign a peace deal with Russia [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=31.92s)]
*  by denying Ukraine access to those satellite images. Pictures taken by the US firm Maxar [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=37.24s)]
*  are no longer available to Kyiv. They were used to track Russian troop movements and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=44.96s)]
*  assess damage from air strikes. Washington had already cut off military aid and intelligence [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=49.56s)]
*  The United States is due to hold direct talks with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia next week on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=55.68s)]
*  ending the war that followed Russia's full-scale invasion. Our Ukraine correspondent James [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=60.08s)]
*  Waterhouse has this update. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=65.84s)]
*  It was a night where we saw widespread Russian drone attacks as Ukraine often does see. It's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=67.52s)]
*  an eastern town called Dobropilie, which you've seen there, where residential buildings were [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=75.64s)]
*  struck by several drones it seems. At least 12 people have been killed, we understand. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=80.44s)]
*  It sits in a region gradually being swallowed by advancing Russian forces. And we've also [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=88.56s)]
*  seen a targeting of a city in the northeastern Kharkiv region. But as ever, it doesn't stop [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=95.0s)]
*  there. We've seen energy facilities targeted in the south as well as in the central provinces [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=100.36s)]
*  of Ukraine. And it is this mutual pausing of targeting infrastructure in this way which [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=106.68s)]
*  Ukraine has suggested could be part of an initial ceasefire agreement. But Russia has [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=112.84s)]
*  firmly rejected that so far. Across the border in western Russia, in the Krasnodar-Kly region, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=118.0s)]
*  officials there said they've intercepted 31 Ukrainian drones going the other way as they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=126.4s)]
*  attempted to target an oil refinery there. So in short, yes, it has been quite a night [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=130.2s)]
*  for Ukraine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=135.88s)]
*  What do you think the impact will be of this US decision to now deny access to commercial [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=137.6s)]
*  satellite imagery? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  In short, it makes Ukraine's ability to defend itself all the more difficult. In the words [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=148.04s)]
*  of one Ukrainian officer this morning, we're fighting blind in some areas. Maxar satellite [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=154.02s)]
*  imagery, American intelligence, it's all central to how Ukraine detects incoming drones, picks [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=160.38000000000002s)]
*  up the gathering of invading Russian forces, how it conducts its own offensive operations, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=167.5s)]
*  how it launches long-range missile strikes. This has been an unraveling of its relationship [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=173.5s)]
*  with Washington which has directly hampered its ability to both fight and defend. And [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=179.84s)]
*  there is nothing new that has been announced by the Trump administration which is slowing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=185.6s)]
*  down Russia's advances. Donald Trump yesterday even suggested he was understanding why Vladimir [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=190.44s)]
*  Putin was upping his attacks in this way. He did threaten Moscow with large-scale sanctions [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=196.38s)]
*  and tariffs after the bombardment we've seen. But then in the same breath he suggested that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=203.78s)]
*  Russia would be easier to deal with in a ceasefire negotiation than Ukraine despite the latter, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=211.18s)]
*  in his words, not holding any of the cards. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=215.94s)]
*  And James, is there any sense of what Ukraine is expecting out of these talks that are going [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=217.98s)]
*  to take place in Saudi Arabia? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=222.34s)]
*  Well I think in an immediate sense they would like America to restore its support in some [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=227.3s)]
*  way. And I think that's far from guaranteed. I think America would like, it would like [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=232.22s)]
*  America to unlock that military aid, those armored vehicles, the ammunition that is partly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=236.22s)]
*  sitting in depots now in neighboring Poland. It would like its intelligence to be shared [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=242.3s)]
*  once more and it would more longer term like America to say right, now that you have come [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=246.86s)]
*  to the table, now that you maybe have signed this minerals deal, giving us access to billions [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  of dollars of your minerals in the future, we will now start to provide you with security [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=257.54s)]
*  guarantees, some kind of military promise that we would be here, we would step in if [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=263.42s)]
*  Russia tried to invade again, which is a very real fear here, in the future. That is Ukraine's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=268.34s)]
*  dream but at the moment President Zelensky is running out of political road. He's simply [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=275.5s)]
*  just having to engage and that's certainly what his European allies want him to do. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=279.66s)]
*  James Waterhouse speaking to Nikki within the past hour. Well as James was mentioning [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  there, the US has increased pressure on Ukraine to reach a possible peace deal with Russia [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=288.58s)]
*  by withdrawing access to American satellite imagery, which of course was being used by [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=293.5s)]
*  Kiev to track Russian troop movements. President Trump also said that he's finding it more [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=298.34000000000003s)]
*  difficult to deal with Ukraine than with Russia. Our North America editor Sarah Smith has more. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=303.02s)]
*  Donald Trump believes that from behind his oval office desk, he alone can end war and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=308.02s)]
*  make peace in Ukraine. He was asked if he believes Vladimir Putin is serious about peace. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  I believe him, I believe him. I think we're doing very well with Russia. But right now [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  they're bombing the hell out of Ukraine. I'm finding it more difficult frankly to deal [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  with Ukraine. And they don't have the cards. They don't have the cards. As you know we're [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=330.74s)]
*  meeting in Saudi Arabia on sometime next week early and we're talking. I find that in terms [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=337.42s)]
*  of getting a final settlement it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising because [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=345.66s)]
*  they have all the cards. He consistently sounds more favorable to the aggressor, Russia and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=351.42s)]
*  its authoritarian leader. He wants to end the war. He wants to end it. And I think he's going to be [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=356.90000000000003s)]
*  more generous than he has to be. And that's pretty good. That means a lot of good things. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=362.74s)]
*  As Ukraine is pounded, it's still deprived of American military assistance and intelligence [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=369.18s)]
*  sharing. No word on when it might be restored. In his nightly address, President Zelensky says [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=376.14s)]
*  he does want to end the war. Ukraine is ready for peace as soon as possible. We have proposed [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=381.54s)]
*  concrete steps and every day new Russian strikes and reality itself prove that it's Russia that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=388.94s)]
*  must be forced into peace, into stopping the war, into real diplomacy. High-level US and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=396.38s)]
*  Russian officials have already shared talks in Saudi Arabia. That was one more thing that seemed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=403.42s)]
*  to favor the Russian side. Next week Ukraine gets its seat at this table to meet American [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=407.86s)]
*  diplomats and discuss what they might accept in a peace deal. Sarah Smith, BBC News, Washington. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=413.1s)]
*  And we have a live page running on this story with the very latest on Ukraine, those developments [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2n8UPTl98Y&t=419.5s)]
