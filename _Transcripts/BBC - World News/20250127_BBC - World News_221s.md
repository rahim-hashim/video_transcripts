Video Description: Four lynx were captured in the Scottish Highlands earlier in January after being illegally released into the wild.
 
Some have described their release as reckless and irresponsible, but there are a growing number of so-called “guerilla rewilders” who believe rare and even extinct species should be reintroduced to the country - regardless of what the government rules say.
 
BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt went to Devon to meet Derek Gow, who breeds British indigenous animals with a view to releasing them, to discuss rewilding the animal.
 
Farming communities have voiced concern about the potential impact on livestock.

# Should lynx be re-introduced to Britain in future? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c)
*  Derek Gow is a renegade. Some would call him a criminal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=0.0s)]
*  He breeds British indigenous animals with a view to releasing them into the wild. What [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=9.36s)]
*  he is doing is potentially illegal because some of the animals he breeds became extinct [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=14.82s)]
*  here hundreds of years ago and there are laws against their release. Animals like these [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=19.84s)]
*  magnificent creatures, lynx. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=25.16s)]
*  Derek when was the last time these would have been seen in the wild in the UK? Late middle [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  ages so you are looking at probably somewhere between 400 and 500 years ago. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=32.36s)]
*  Bringing animals like this into the wild is very controversial. A few weeks ago four lynx [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  were released in the Scottish Highlands. They were caught. One of the cats later died. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=42.48s)]
*  Police Scotland is investigating the incident. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=48.56s)]
*  You've got lynx. Did you release lynx into Scotland? I did not release lynx in Scotland. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=52.04s)]
*  Would you consider doing that? I would consider doing it. I think it would be really difficult [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=56.66s)]
*  and our cats would not be good candidate cats because they are so tame. The creatures that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=60.58s)]
*  should be here aren't here because of what we did in the past and now that we just don't [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=64.97999999999999s)]
*  need as many sheep or all the food in theory that the landscape is here to produce why [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=69.74s)]
*  can't we start to restore some of the lost creatures to it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=75.1s)]
*  This is not just a hobby. Derek Gow's 400 acre farm here in Devon has become a centre [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=77.94s)]
*  for breeding rare species. He employs 15 people and while he may not have any plans to release [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=85.62s)]
*  his lynx into the wild any time soon this place has become a hub for other covert species [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=91.14s)]
*  reintroductions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=99.14s)]
*  It's a girl. Some of his team are weighing water bowls. 110. So you've got some growing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=102.14000000000001s)]
*  to do my love? Gow says he's released some 25,000 of this once common now endangered [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=112.54s)]
*  species over the years. He's also responsible for releasing dozens of these beavers into [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  the wild here in the UK. And he's working with other species. The last recorded UK breeding [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=126.34s)]
*  pair of black storks was in 1416. White storks were also once indigenous to the UK but are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=134.46s)]
*  now extinct. He's got pole caps and is now breeding insects too including these glowworms. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  This is irresponsible. You don't know the damage that could be done. You don't know [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=152.9s)]
*  the financial impacts that could be caused. Where are the impact assessments? And in the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=155.98000000000002s)]
*  up in a position where they need to be controlled there is no ability to control those species. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=161.46s)]
*  So I think it really is irresponsible. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  Derek Gow says the UK is facing an urgent nature emergency. Government rules on reintroductions [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=170.74s)]
*  are too restrictive, too complex and far too slow. You're making unilateral decisions [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=177.62s)]
*  without regard for what the regulations say you should do. Well I'm making unilateral [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=183.82s)]
*  decisions but the decisions are to release a lot of benign water voles. I'm doing good [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=188.78s)]
*  things. I'm on the side of the small and the press. I don't think I'm doing anything bad. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=192.28s)]
*  He plans to release these Scottish wildcats later this year. Now Gow's activities may [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  sound noble but his approach is divisive. Some see him as a courageous visionary, others [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  regard him as an arrogant maverick whose animal releases could do more harm than good. Justin [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs0g_V06d7c&t=209.84s)]
