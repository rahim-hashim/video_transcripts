Video Description: The German parliament has rejected immigration measures put forward by the conservative opposition and backed by the far-right.
 
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz had tried to rely on support from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party for the second time in a week - but the bill was defeated by 350 votes to 338.
 
The strategy was widely condemned, including by former chancellor Angela Merkel, who accused Merz of turning his back on a previous pledge not to work with AfD in the Bundestag.
 
Merz defended his actions as "necessary" and said he had not sought the party's support.

# German immigration bill rejected despite far-right backing | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk)
*  To Germany now, where the parliament has just rejected a proposed new law to tighten immigration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=0.0s)]
*  Our correspondent Damian McGuinness was following events in the Bundestag. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=6.32s)]
*  It's all about whether you invite the far right in or whether you keep them out in the cold [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=11.08s)]
*  and don't work with them in German politics, this so-called firewall. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=17.8s)]
*  And the reason why the Conservative leader's bill was so very controversial is that he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=21.32s)]
*  effectively would have relied on the far right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=28.12s)]
*  We now know that that attempt has now failed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  This is a real blow to Friedrich Merz, whose party is leading the polls. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=33.84s)]
*  And I think it shows that it potentially undermines his attempt to really, as he puts it, go all [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=38.24s)]
*  in on migration, because it shows that the majority in parliament does not agree with [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=46.0s)]
*  his tactic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=51.08s)]
*  Now, I think what we've seen over the certainly today and all week, really, is a really ferocious [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=52.08s)]
*  debate about what the Conservative Party is all about. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=57.74s)]
*  This is a party that's trying to find its way after years of being led by the centrist [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=61.72s)]
*  Chancellor Angela Merkel, who famously said, wir schaffen das, and said that Germany can [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  take in refugees and migrants and can manage. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=73.26s)]
*  Friedrich Merz has responded by shifting the party to the right. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=76.9s)]
*  He was trying with this bill to win over right-wingers and lure them back, potentially those who [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=80.9s)]
*  were thinking about voting for the far right AFD, by talking tough on migration. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=87.36s)]
*  Now, this tactic hasn't worked in parliament. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=92.6s)]
*  And if you look at polls, it's not clear whether it would work at the ballot box either. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=95.62s)]
*  Either way, he has suffered a blow today politically. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=100.52s)]
*  And it will also be interesting whether members of his Conservative Party didn't toe the line, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=104.62s)]
*  because it was a named vote. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=110.02s)]
*  And I think we'll get some more information about that, because the Conservatives are [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=111.6s)]
*  deeply split on migration. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=114.76s)]
*  The former Chancellor Angela Merkel made an intervention yesterday, and usually calling [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=117.68s)]
*  Friedrich Merz's tactics wrong, which is very unusual. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing now is the Conservatives really trying to decide which way they're [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=126.12s)]
*  going to go now in the election campaign, because of course we have an election in three [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=131.56s)]
*  weeks' time, and there's everything to play for. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  So this has been a dramatic day in parliament, really, because of the election. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=137.6s)]
*  As you say, Damien, it's going to be really, really interesting to get the readout of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=140.92s)]
*  who has voted and how they have voted and where the support for Friedrich Merz has fallen [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=145.16s)]
*  away. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=150.44s)]
*  Speaking of that election coming up very soon, what do you think this result does to his [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  ambitions to be the next Chancellor? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=157.56s)]
*  I mean, he's still way ahead in the polls. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=159.92s)]
*  So his party is traditionally the largest party, has been for a while. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=163.27999999999997s)]
*  It's polling at around 30%. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=168.27999999999997s)]
*  The difficulty for him is who he's going to work with, and that's where it gets tricky. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=170.72s)]
*  And the question will really be whether this whole very messy, very difficult debate over [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=175.0s)]
*  migration has helped or harmed the far-right AfD, because if it boosts the numbers of the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=182.44s)]
*  AfD, if voters look at this mess in parliament this week and think mainstream parties just [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=187.56s)]
*  can't get it together, then it's going to eat into the support of the mainstream parties, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=193.96s)]
*  because even if no other party will work with the AfD, it means there's fewer votes [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=199.56s)]
*  to go round within other parties. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  And what it means is even if Friedrich Merz does become Chancellor, which, looking at [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=205.8s)]
*  the poll numbers right now, he's more likely to do than Olaf Scholz, even if he does, if [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=209.68s)]
*  he has to cobble together a very difficult coalition with partners he doesn't want to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=214.68s)]
*  work with, or maybe a three-way coalition, which is what we've had now, which was very [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=219.44s)]
*  unstable and argumentative, it's going to make his government very difficult. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=223.88s)]
*  So he still might become Chancellor, but it's not much good for him if it's a very difficult [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=227.44s)]
*  government to lead, because Germany's got some big challenges ahead and needs a unified [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=233.28s)]
*  and quite strong government to deal with those challenges that we're now looking at. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=238.44s)]
*  Damian McGuinness in Berlin, let's speak now to Dr Ed Turner, who is chair of the International [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=242.84s)]
*  Association for the Study of German Politics and professor of German politics at Aston [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=248.0s)]
*  University. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=252.66s)]
*  Ed, thank you very much for joining us on BBC News. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=253.66s)]
*  What's your reaction to what's been happening in the Bundestag? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=256.68s)]
*  Really dramatic scenes there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=259.44s)]
*  Well, that's right, and a surprising result. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=261.6s)]
*  I think I could help. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=266.32s)]
*  A lot of the dissidents came actually from the Liberal Party, the FDP. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=267.32s)]
*  There was a rebellion amongst Christian Democrats against Merz as well. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=272.44s)]
*  I think 11 or 12 didn't vote with his party and abstained or voted against. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=277.2s)]
*  So, taking a step back, this has been an incredible week in German politics. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  Even in November, Friedrich Merz was saying that he would ensure that no motions were [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=289.6s)]
*  passed or laws were passed which were reliant on the far-right AFD. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=294.68s)]
*  That changed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=298.56s)]
*  It changed due to tremendous pressure on asylum migration security issues, and now we see [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  the current situation. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=305.92s)]
*  And ultimately, do you think this is going to boost numbers for the AFD, or may it have [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  the opposite effect? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=313.28s)]
*  Might it boost or encourage voters who disagree with the AFD and what it represents to come [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=314.28s)]
*  out and vote for parties that oppose the AFD? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, the AFD are absolutely cock-a-hoop. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  They've been laughing and joking, celebrating Great Day for Democracy on Wednesday, the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=328.67999999999995s)]
*  firewall's gone, now they can attack Merz and say he's been an ineffective leader. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=334.84s)]
*  That being said, I don't think they're going to win the election. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=339.96s)]
*  They're still a deeply disliked party amongst most German voters, so there's a limit to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=343.52s)]
*  how high they can poll. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=350.08s)]
*  And also, certainly, there will also be some moderate voters who will have been somewhat [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=353.84s)]
*  repelled by the decision of the Christian Democrats to accept the support of the AFD [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=357.76s)]
*  in an attempt to get motions and the law through. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=362.56s)]
*  Do you think, despite all of this, Merz's party, the CDU, will emerge as the biggest [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=366.48s)]
*  party in the forthcoming elections and that it will be he who is trying to put forward [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=370.36s)]
*  a bring-together coalition? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, polls in recent months have been extremely stable for the Christian Democrats. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=378.68s)]
*  They look like getting around 30 percent, and it would be a remarkable level of change [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  for them to decline so that they didn't win the election. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=389.86s)]
*  So Merz is going to be in a position probably to try to lead talks to form a government. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=394.06s)]
*  That looks much harder, as your correspondent was saying after this week. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=398.86s)]
*  There's real anger, real consternation amongst social Democrats and amongst Greens, and he'd [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=403.26s)]
*  need at least one of those parties on board to form a government about what's happened. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=412.06s)]
*  And so coalition talks, which would already be quite difficult after the election, become [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=417.06s)]
*  really, really difficult, and the relationships involved as well, which are also necessary [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=422.66s)]
*  to run an effective government, those are really shot to pieces. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=426.06s)]
*  And of course a lot of concern and questions by partners in the EU, and briefly if you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=429.76s)]
*  would on this answer, Ed, as to what this means for one of the biggest hitters in the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=435.26s)]
*  bloc, a bloc, a country that they have traditionally looked to, to really be the linchpin of the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=439.76s)]
*  European Union. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  There are two problems. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=448.06s)]
*  One is the likely next Chancellor of Germany has been proposing measures, legislation, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=449.06s)]
*  which are at odds with European law. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=453.85999999999996s)]
*  That could start a domino effect and see other nations also saying we want to turn people [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  away at our borders, we want to shut our borders. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=459.85999999999996s)]
*  That would plunge the EU into a really difficult position, maybe a crisis. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  Secondly, a political hiatus in Germany, a vacuum of leadership will also be very difficult [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=466.06s)]
*  for the European Union to negotiate. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=471.76s)]
*  Ed, thank you very much. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7y37C5ZvMk&t=473.85999999999996s)]
