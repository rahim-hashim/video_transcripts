Video Description: Stock markets around the world fell following the introduction of tariffs by US President Donald Trump on goods entering the US from China, Canada and Mexico.
 
Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and 20% tariffs against China.
 
Canada and China announced their own import taxes on US goods, while Mexico said it had "contingency plans", sparking fears of full-blown trade war.
 
Analysts have warned tariffs could push up prices for US households and could also have a knock on effect on consumers across the world.

# US President Donald Trump's tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico begin | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8)
*  Thank you very much indeed, Karin. Yes, looking at financial markets in Europe, the trading day has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=0.0s)]
*  just kicked off and actually that situation with regards to Ukraine is very much weighing on the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=4.16s)]
*  minds of investors and market traders as they react to all the news that has been coming out [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=8.32s)]
*  of Washington. So Karin, they're mentioning the fact that the US has announced that it is pausing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=14.96s)]
*  military aid for Ukraine. Interestingly, during the last few days and weeks, we have seen [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=21.44s)]
*  defence stocks, for example, listed in Europe do extremely well off the back of that news and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=26.8s)]
*  we'll see reaction to what Ursula von der Leyen was just outlining there in Brussels as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=32.0s)]
*  But if we just bring you the latest on tariffs, as you've been hearing, Donald Trump has doubled [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=37.6s)]
*  down on his threat of tariffs, saying that time ran out to reach a deal. So from 5GMT this morning, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=43.68s)]
*  the US imposed new charges on goods imported from Canada, Mexico and China. So in the case of Canada [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=52.72s)]
*  and Mexico, the tariff on all imported goods to the US is 25%. Officials from both countries [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=60.24s)]
*  have been in Washington in recent days and they've been trying to broker a reprieve on this, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=69.44s)]
*  but they were not successful. Canada has already said therefore it will impose retaliatory tariffs [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=74.72s)]
*  against US imports of $155 billion, with the first $30 billion starting today. And these will affect [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=80.8s)]
*  all sorts of goods, food, clothing and energy. Trump has also hit China with additional 10% [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  tariffs today. This is on top of the 10% that was imposed on Chinese exports in February, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=97.12s)]
*  meaning goods from the world's number two economy will face a levy of at least 20% [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  now. And Beijing responded by saying it's imposing its own additional tariffs of between 10 and 15% [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=108.88s)]
*  on some US products that will start on the 10th of March. And these products is a whole range as [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=115.2s)]
*  well, including food, vegetables, biotech instruments and all sorts of aviation. US stock [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=121.44s)]
*  markets, not surprisingly, off the back of the announcement from the White House that these [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  tariffs would be going ahead responded pretty badly. That was the close of trade in on the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=134.0s)]
*  NASDAQ on Wall Street. We also saw the down the S&P lose quite a bit of ground. Let's have a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=139.28s)]
*  listen in again to what President Trump had to say on this. No room left for Mexico or for Canada. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=146.08s)]
*  No, the tariffs, you know, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow. Mr. President, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=154.16s)]
*  just to follow up on my colleague's question. Just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=159.28s)]
*  have poured into our country from Mexico and as you know, also from China where it goes to Mexico [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  and goes to Canada. And China also had an additional 10. So it's 10 plus 10. And it comes in from [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=172.16s)]
*  Canada and it comes in from Mexico. And that's a very important thing to say. Let's be clear. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=179.28s)]
*  If Trump is imposing tariffs, we're ready. We are ready with $155 billion worth of tariffs [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=185.44s)]
*  and we're ready with the first tranche of tariffs, which is 30 billion, which is already known. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  And we'll be getting more reaction from Canada in a moment. But first of all, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=201.68s)]
*  let's focus on Mexico. So the Mexican currency, the peso has fallen quite a bit down around a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=204.8s)]
*  percent since the new tariffs were confirmed. I spoke to Juan Carlos Baker. He is former Deputy [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=210.8s)]
*  Trade Minister of Mexico and he gave me his thoughts on these latest developments from Mexico City. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=218.0s)]
*  I think that the plan, as you mentioned, has been touted for a while. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  President Sheinbaum has repeatedly stated that Mexico does have a plan. But the reality is that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=230.88000000000002s)]
*  details of such plan have not been disclosed as of yet. My guess is that the president was waiting [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=235.92s)]
*  until the very last moment to see if the tariffs do come into effect because, you know, in the past, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  President Trump, at the very last minute, withdrew his threat. It doesn't seem to be the case now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=249.27999999999997s)]
*  So we would be expecting the official Mexican reaction tomorrow morning once the president [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=254.48s)]
*  delivers her daily press conference and where details we expect will be laid out. However, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=260.08s)]
*  speculation is that such plan B involves what the Mexican retaliation would be against US goods [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=267.04s)]
*  exported to Mexico in a similar fashion to what Canada has already announced. But reality is that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=273.6s)]
*  we do not know those details just yet. Many American companies, big names in the car industry, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=278.88s)]
*  for example, have got factories in Mexico, make their goods in Mexico, which are then brought in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=284.64s)]
*  to America. Talk us through the impact this will have. Well, there will be two types of impacts, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=290.0s)]
*  the most immediate one would be, of course, the hit that the stock market exchange rate [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=296.24s)]
*  and other variables will take. That can be expected within the few hours once the tariffs [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=302.32s)]
*  have been confirmed. Now, in the longer term, and by longer, I mean maybe one month, maybe two months, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=308.32s)]
*  this is just how fast things are moving right now. I would expect that some investments [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=314.48s)]
*  that are due or that are supposed to come to Mexico will be canceled. I would also be expecting [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  that some of the companies that, as you say, have large operations in the country make some [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=325.68s)]
*  announcements on reconsidering whether some of that production can be shipped back to the United [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  States in order to appease Donald Trump and by extension to avoid those tariffs. But the reality [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=335.6s)]
*  is that all those movements, whether major or not, are really not going to be sufficient to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=340.48s)]
*  undo the deep integration that Mexico and the United States have and that has been constructed [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=347.36s)]
*  over the past 40 years. So my expectation would be that if Mexico retaliates with tariffs of its own, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=352.32s)]
*  then after a few weeks, some serious efforts need to take place in order to remove those tariffs and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=358.8s)]
*  try to reassume trade as normal as possible. But again, it all depends on how Mexico decides to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=364.96s)]
*  respond. So that's the reaction from Mexico. Let's get some thoughts from Canada. Amos [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=372.08s)]
*  E. Ilanda is senior lecturer of economics at Concordia University in Montreal and explained [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=378.08s)]
*  he's not sure Canada's economy can avoid a recession with these new tariffs in place. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  It's unfortunate. Everybody in Canada was hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. I think [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=389.04s)]
*  he played a clip earlier of one of our ministers saying that we're ready. I'm not entirely sure [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=395.68s)]
*  that it's going to have the desired effect, but Canada's going to do what it can to show that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  it's going to stand up to Trump and the administration. And just talk us through what [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  that looks like in Canada, because of course we've got a government that's aware there's an [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  election very, very soon. There could be a change of guard and yet they're trying to deal with this [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=414.32s)]
*  current crisis, which is huge for the Canadian economy. Many are saying this could push Canada [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=419.52s)]
*  into recession. It's very likely going to tip us into recession. And you're right, we're a little [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=424.0s)]
*  bit rudderless right now in terms of leadership. The governing party is about to appoint a new [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=428.56s)]
*  leader by the end of the month and probably call an election sometime in the summer, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=433.76s)]
*  where we're expecting to see the Conservative party take power for the first time in a decade. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=437.68s)]
*  You would think that that party might be a little more aligned with the Republicans in the US, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=441.76s)]
*  but in fact it doesn't appear that there's any love for the Conservative leader. And in fact, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=447.52s)]
*  the Liberals are now pulling ahead in the polls for the first time in a long time. The Trump [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=452.8s)]
*  tariffs have seemed to unite Canada in a way that we haven't seen in a long time, including the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  Separatist province of Quebec. So I think that Canadians are prepared that if there's any cost [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  that we have to bear, we're prepared to bear those costs as a way to try and show that we're [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=466.4s)]
*  not inferior to our big brothers to the south. What can Canada offer to President Trump to sort [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=471.84s)]
*  of try and remove these tariffs going forward? Because when he initially announced the 30-day [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  reprieve, that was in response to Canada saying, listen, we're really increasing [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  operations on the border to prevent movement there. We've got a czar monitoring the border. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=491.52s)]
*  We're looking at the drugs crossing across and all that kind of thing. What more can Canada be [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=497.44s)]
*  doing, do you think? Yeah, it's probably what's next on the bucket list for Trump. He's very upset [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=502.4s)]
*  with the dairy management and the agricultural restrictions that we put on the Americans to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=508.96s)]
*  access our market. We're very restrictive about Americans and their banks operating here, their [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=513.12s)]
*  telecommunications companies. And the Americans have long criticized Canada for not spending 2% [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=517.36s)]
*  of GDP on defense and shirking our NATO duties. I have a feeling that even if we say that, look, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=522.88s)]
*  fentanyl was never the issue to begin with, immigrants crossing from the north into the U.S. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=530.96s)]
*  was never the issue to begin with, I have a feeling that he's going to say, yeah, you're [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=534.88s)]
*  probably right. You've done what you need to. Now here's the next things that I want to make the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=538.16s)]
*  tariffs go away. And I have a feeling that even if we start to address those things, it's merely [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=541.6s)]
*  going to be a long list of grievances that he has. Moshe Landa there, an economics professor [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=545.76s)]
*  based in Montreal. Well, let's now focus on China. It has announced today its own retaliatory tariffs [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=551.92s)]
*  of between 10 and 15% against certain U.S. goods. China has said it will fight to the better end [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=558.8s)]
*  if the U.S. pushes on with a trade war. Chinese leaders are in Beijing today. They're at their [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=566.16s)]
*  annual meeting with economic growth high on the agenda, as Nick Marsh explains. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=571.6s)]
*  China is prepared to fight to the bitter end if this new trade war escalates even further. But [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=601.6s)]
*  none of this really is good for China. Let's not forget that its economy is really in the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=609.12s)]
*  doldrums. It's struggling with low growth, with weak demand. Households are feeling poorer because [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=614.88s)]
*  of this protracted property crisis. So plenty of domestic issues to have to deal with as well, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=620.64s)]
*  as you quite rightly pointed out there. The top leadership is meeting in Beijing. It's going to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=626.08s)]
*  set its annual growth target. We're expecting that to be around 5%. That's pretty ambitious [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=631.04s)]
*  considering the context of all of this. How are they going to be able to do that? Well, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=636.56s)]
*  it's going to take quite a lot of government spending to stimulate that internal demand. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=641.28s)]
*  Do local governments, does the central government have the money to do that? Maybe not. So China's [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=646.16s)]
*  looking to alternative investments in high-tech industries, things like artificial intelligence, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=651.36s)]
*  green renewable energies. The idea is that China will be able to grow through these industries of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=657.8399999999999s)]

*  Right now in Europe, we've had 45 minutes of trade in the key financial markets across Europe. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=686.4s)]

*  it's into safe havens such as sovereign debt. So people are moving their money and it's not just [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=702.9599999999999s)]

*  If we stay on the subject, some prominent economists are warning these new tariffs that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=722.56s)]
*  we've been talking about will hurt the US economy and manufacturers across America are getting ready [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=728.0s)]
*  for a hit. Our North America business correspondent Erin Delmore looked at how the 41 billion dollar [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=734.24s)]
*  domestic toy market is reacting and found it isn't all fun and games. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=740.56s)]
*  Here at the North American International Toy Fair in New York City, I'm surrounded by things that [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=746.56s)]
*  delight. But manufacturers aren't feeling so joyful as they're ready for new tariffs set to [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=751.04s)]
*  go into effect, including an additional tariff on imports from China. That's where around 80% [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=755.52s)]
*  of toys sold here in the US are made. We do know this, that tariffs will be inflationary for toys. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  Raising toy prices is bad for small businesses. It's bad for families that are budget conscious [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=767.76s)]
*  and it potentially even swings the door open for knockoffs and counterfeit toys that might not go [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=773.04s)]

*  it really is impossible for that not to be passed on in some way to the US consumer. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=796.56s)]

*  under the tree, it might cost them an extra $50, $100, $200 to buy those gifts for their children. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=820.0s)]
*  And of course, you know, I hope the administration would not want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Lci9j9_w8&t=825.36s)]
