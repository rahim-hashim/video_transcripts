# Sixteen Sudan civilians killed in attack | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec)
*  Humanitarian volunteers in Sudan say 16 civilians have been killed after paramilitary forces shelled a displacement camp close to al-Fasha, the capital of North Darfur. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=0.0s)]
*  The army and paramilitary forces have been accused of indiscriminately bombing civilians and medical facilities, attacking residential areas and using mass starvation as a weapon of war. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=10.72s)]
*  This comes more than a week after the eastern city of Wad Madani was recaptured by the army from its rival, the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=21.52s)]
*  Sudan's troops and RSF militia have been fighting for control of Sudan for close to two years now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Many regions and cities have been affected by the ongoing violence amid limited international aid. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=36.08s)]
*  On that, the UN predicts that by May around half of the entire population of Sudan will face acute food deprivation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=42.8s)]
*  So let's speak now to Lene Kinsley, who is a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, who has made it to Port Sudan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=51.28s)]
*  Very good to have you with us, Lene. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=57.92s)]
*  Have you had any luck, the World Food Programme, getting any kind of food aid into Wad Madani? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=59.44s)]
*  Yes, we just yesterday got 11 trucks carrying 260 metric tons of assistance into Wad Madani. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=65.12s)]
*  Less than a week since the situation there became calm enough to be able to deliver, WFP delivered. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=75.04s)]
*  That's assistance, nutrition supplements, food packages for 20,000 people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=83.2s)]
*  And that's just the start. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=89.76s)]
*  And I think that shows what we can do if we are able to deliver if there is safe passage, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=91.44s)]
*  and especially if the security situation allows us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=98.08s)]
*  Lene, there's been so much concern around famine and the different areas that are suffering with acute need. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=101.12s)]
*  Just give us an idea of what it's like in a city like Wad Madani. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=108.32s)]
*  So people lack basic items, access to basic food supplies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=111.52s)]
*  What I hear on the ground is that people are basically surviving off of a watered down lentil soup. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=117.84s)]
*  That's all they get to eat in a day, if they're lucky. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=124.4s)]
*  No access to clean water. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  It's an extremely dire situation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  And Wad Madani, Maadani al-Kubra, is one of the 17 risk of famine locations. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=132.56s)]
*  And when we're talking about risk of famine, these are severe levels of hunger. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=138.96s)]
*  People are not able to have a basic meal a day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Children have high rates of malnutrition. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=147.36s)]
*  And that is why the food assistance is so critical. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=150.56s)]
*  That's why it's so important that we have access to these areas. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=153.52s)]
*  And most important, that the situation is safe enough for us to get there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=156.88s)]
*  On that, the army and paramilitary forces accused of killing people in the area, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  accused of indiscriminately bombing in so many areas. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=168.16s)]
*  How dangerous is it to operate if you're a humanitarian in Sudan at the moment? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=171.92s)]
*  It is extremely dangerous. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=178.0s)]
*  It's extremely difficult, especially in the areas where there is active fighting ongoing, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=180.16s)]
*  like in Khartoum, around al-Fasher, for example. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  We have had occasions where we've had to either delay [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=189.76s)]
*  a convoy full of assistance destined to a specific area because conflict erupted. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=193.44s)]
*  Areas that we can't reach because conflict is along a route on the way to that place. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=199.44s)]
*  And very unfortunately, we have had WFP staff members who have lost their lives, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=208.08s)]
*  sacrificed their lives carrying out their humanitarian duties. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=214.16s)]
*  That is the reality of the situation we're facing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=217.52s)]
*  But in the face of that, we are not giving up. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=221.04s)]
*  We continue to do whatever we can to deliver aid for the Sudanese people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=223.44s)]
*  Lina Kinsey, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=228.88s)]
*  We wish you and your team luck in the coming days [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=231.12s)]
*  as you try to deliver that aid from the World Food Programme. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjSaVphcec&t=235.36s)]
