# The shopping mall where everything is recycled - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 10, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg)
*  This shopping mall in Sweden may look normal, but there's something different about it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=0.0s)]
*  Every item here is second-hand. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=10.0s)]
*  Some products are upcycled, so unwanted things are reinvented as something new, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=20.0s)]
*  like this lampshade, which is made from worn-out leather jackets. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=26.0s)]
*  It's a high-fashion trash shopping mall where you can come and just do sustainable shopping, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=32.0s)]
*  and Sweden loves it, and the world loves it. Everyone wants to be like us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=37.0s)]
*  The clever thing about this mall in Eskilstuna near Stockholm is its location, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=43.0s)]
*  right next to the city's recycling centre, so a steady stream of cars is already coming [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=51.0s)]
*  to drop off unwanted household items. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=57.0s)]
*  A team sorts everything into categories. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=67.0s)]
*  The mall's shopkeepers can then pick things to resell or upcycle. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=72.0s)]
*  Maria Larsson runs a popular shop. It sells handmade household ornaments. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=77.0s)]
*  This is the most creative place to be in, and I'm also saving the planet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=84.0s)]
*  You can buy things other people don't use anymore, so it's good for the nature and good for the environment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=92.0s)]
*  Because in Sweden we like to think about the environment, and shopping like this is good for the environment. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=100.0s)]
*  The mall has 14 specialist shops. It also hosts a design school. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=107.0s)]
*  Students learn how to upcycle commonly donated objects. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=117.0s)]
*  I really want to make something good about the climate crisis right now, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=121.0s)]
*  and I feel like I'm in the right place. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=126.0s)]
*  In 2018 the mall sold second-hand goods worth 1.3 million dollars, meaning unwanted items found new homes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-SVQTxQcrg&t=130.0s)]
