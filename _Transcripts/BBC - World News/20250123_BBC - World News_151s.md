Video Description: The world's largest iceberg is on a collision course with a remote British island, potentially putting penguins and seals in danger.
 
The iceberg is spinning northwards from Antarctica towards South Georgia, a rugged British territory and wildlife haven, where it could ground and smash into pieces. 
 
Countless birds and seals died on South Georgia's icy coves and beaches when past giant icebergs stopped them feeding. 
 
A group of scientists around the world, sailors and fishermen are anxiously checking satellite pictures to monitor the daily movements of the iceberg.

# World's largest iceberg heading for British territory | BBC News

*  The world's largest iceberg has broken away from Antarctica and is approaching the British [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  territory of South Georgia, home to large penguin and seal colonies. Fishermen and authorities [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=5.22s)]
*  are bracing for impact. Georgina Ranard reports. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=10.98s)]
*  This is the world's largest iceberg. And probably the laziest. For decades it loitered, stuck [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=15.540000000000001s)]

*  right in its path, lies the British territory of South Georgia. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=36.86s)]
*  I will take you out the door. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=41.26s)]
*  Ice is a way of life for sailors and fishermen there. But they can't ignore something the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=43.96s)]
*  size of A23A. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  There's an iceberg over that way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  You have to have a very healthy respect for the ice. Because if you don't it will get [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=52.66s)]
*  you. It can come out of nowhere and you get something the size of A23A when it comes along [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=57.18s)]
*  and it deposits these thousands of tons of ice. They just kind of hang around the island [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=61.34s)]
*  and it does make things a lot more tricky. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=66.62s)]
*  The chunks could also block coves where these go to feed, putting half the world's king [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=72.22s)]

*  British researchers on this ship seized the chance to visit A23A. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=83.98s)]
*  It's a really amazing experience. It's unlike anything that I've ever seen before. You just [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=88.54s)]
*  kind of see a massive wall that is way higher than you are. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=93.34s)]
*  Now it's really difficult to get up close to the world's largest iceberg. But I think [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  I found the next best thing and I have to handle these really carefully. But in here [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=101.78s)]
*  is water that melted straight off the giant iceberg. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=105.9s)]
*  In this lab, scientists are finding out how icebergs affect the ocean's carbon cycle. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=109.7s)]
*  It's unlikely that A23A was caused by climate change because it carved a long time ago in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=115.06s)]

*  giant icebergs will form. So being able to see icebergs like this giant iceberg and study [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=123.58s)]
*  them allows us to understand the impact that they're going to have on the ocean and everything [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1cBCifoX9Y&t=128.86s)]
