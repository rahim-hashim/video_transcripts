Video Description: Protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles have appeared to die down overnight, with LA Mayor Karen Bass taking to social media to tell Angelenos "don’t engage in violence and chaos. Don’t give the administration what they want".
 
Vehicles have been set on fire and there have been some reports of looting, whilst a British photographer needed surgery after being shot with a sponge bullet and an Australian reporter was shot with a non-lethal round while reporting.
 
US president Donald Trump posted on social media: "Looking really bad in LA. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!", having called in the National Guard - against the wishes of California's governor, Gavin Newsom. 
The National Guard acts as a hybrid entity that serves both state and federal interests. Typically, a state's force is activated at the request of the governor.
This is reportedly the first time the National Guard has been activated without request of the state's governor since 1965.

# LA protests seem to die down as mayor tells demonstrators ‘don’t engage in chaos’ | BBC News

*  City and state leaders in Los Angeles have accused President Trump of deliberately provoking chaos [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=0.0s)]

*  as immigration officers rounded up unauthorized migrants. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=24.0s)]
*  The Los Angeles Police Department says that a phone alert's been sent to people in the Civic [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  Center area declaring an unlawful assembly with protesters told to leave. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=32.24s)]
*  They also add that business owners are reporting looting. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=37.68s)]
*  Well our correspondent John Sudworth has the latest. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=42.08s)]
*  Once again downtown Los Angeles echoed to the sound of tear gas and rubber bullets. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=46.64s)]
*  At one point protesters surged onto one of the city's busiest highways [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=52.32s)]
*  before the police eventually cleared the road. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=56.64s)]
*  These were scenes that were repeated throughout the day. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=59.52s)]
*  Over the past few minutes you can probably see the guy with the green gun there he's been firing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=63.6s)]
*  rubber bullets at the direction of the crowd and it shows you just how volatile the situation is. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=67.92s)]
*  This though is what's turned the localized protests into a major story. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=75.04s)]
*  President Trump's protocol busting decision to send in the National Guard [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=79.52s)]
*  against the wishes of the state governor and the city's mayor. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=84.0s)]
*  Deploying federalized troops is a dangerous escalation but we need to be real about this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=87.92s)]
*  This is about another agenda it's not about public safety there's clearly no plan [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=94.4s)]
*  and there is clearly no policy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Mr Trump though insists the National Guard are needed to keep the peace. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=102.72s)]
*  If we see danger to our country and to our citizens we'll be very very strong in terms of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=107.92s)]
*  law and order it's about law and order. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=113.12s)]
*  This Waymo self-driving car was set alight another illustration of the sporadic violence [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  but the majority of protesters have been peaceful many of them from the immigrant [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=122.48s)]
*  community themselves. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  There's some people that they're working not even for the minimum wage but they have to work. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=128.56s)]
*  What do you say when Donald Trump says I have a mandate I was elected on the promise of deporting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=142.24s)]
*  He's not the boss only God. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=143.52s)]
*  The government though insists that the immigration raids will continue [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=146.72s)]
*  and LA is bracing for more of this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=151.28s)]
*  John Sudworth BBC News Los Angeles. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=154.24s)]
*  Well our reporter Carl Nasmans been monitoring events for us in Los Angeles. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  He's been speaking to my colleague Sully Bondoc. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  It's still a very fluid situation here tonight in Los Angeles we've been watching us [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=165.36s)]
*  several police cars and helicopters above us are really trying to tackle some of these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=169.84s)]
*  pockets of unrest that spread out across this area of downtown Los Angeles tonight. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=175.36s)]
*  We've seen just in the past a few minutes or so several fires being set there was a car [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  driving through a crowd it's just felt slightly out of control if not very out of control at times [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=185.76s)]
*  and this is all really spiraling from what we saw earlier today right here this is highway 101 this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=191.68s)]
*  school is going through the center of Los Angeles and you can see here still a long line of police [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=198.48s)]
*  cars these are California Highway Patrol vehicles they are still parked there guarding the entrance [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=203.76s)]
*  to the highway here and you can still see obviously that part of the freeway is still shut down to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  traffic it's been like that for hours they are struggling to get this back open and even hours [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=214.88s)]
*  ago there were still clashes between some of these patrol officers and demonstrators who were [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  standing above these overpasses that go over the freeway in this section we saw some very intense [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=225.6s)]
*  clashes in fact fires breaking out down below on top of and around some of these police vehicles [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=231.76s)]
*  eventually it seemed police were able to gain the upper hand and move these demonstrators away from [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=238.24s)]
*  this area that though spread some of the troublemakers and people that are out late into this night really [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=243.04s)]
*  intent on continuing these demonstrations out into the further reaches of the city but you know this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  is a scene right now where we've seen several dozen people arrested and the authorities right now [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=255.84s)]
*  trying to gain the upper hand and of course these are all scenes that we know President Trump will [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=261.36s)]
*  be following and will be watching and this is something that he says he wants law and order on [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=266.32s)]
*  the streets officials here say they have it under control but right now that the scenes that we're [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=271.6s)]
*  seeing play out certainly don't necessarily say that Los Angeles right now is a city that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=275.84s)]
*  is necessarily calm and of course President Trump made the very controversial step of sending in the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=281.52s)]
*  National Guard on Sunday just describe how that has changed things and impacted the mood among [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=287.68s)]
*  demonstrators and protesters yeah I was speaking with one demonstrator earlier on this afternoon [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=296.24s)]
*  and she was very emotional and she said really the spark for these protests across these three [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=303.12s)]
*  days in Los Angeles were those immigration enforcement actions that we saw at several [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=308.08s)]
*  locations in Los Angeles this is a sanctuary city it's a city made up of immigrants it has one of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=312.96s)]
*  the largest concentrations of undocumented migrants in the entire country and so those [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=318.64s)]
*  immigration actions by those ICE agents I think really struck this community personally and struck [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=324.56s)]
*  it hard but you know that was a spark but the fuel seems to be at least if you talk to California [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=331.44s)]
*  officials the president's decision to federalize some of these National Guard members send them to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=337.28s)]
*  Los Angeles and have them symbolically essentially guard the federal buildings because it's [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=343.28s)]
*  interesting I should say that even despite the amount of unrest that we have seen playing out [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  this afternoon and this evening we actually haven't seen the National Guard itself doing much of the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  responding they're not the ones out here confronting protesters or demonstrators they haven't been the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=358.55999999999995s)]
*  ones really here to try to get things under control they've mostly just been guarding the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=363.68s)]
*  entrance of the federal detention center which is just across the highway here so although it was [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=367.76s)]
*  a very symbolic move it seems to be something that definitely inflamed detentions here but it doesn't [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=373.12s)]
*  seem like they're actually playing that role of peacemaker like President Trump might have hoped [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=378.64s)]
*  well it's definitely inflamed tensions between Gavin Newsom and the president that's California's [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=384.8s)]
*  governor of course Gavin Newsom who is urging President Trump to revoke the troop deployment [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=390.72s)]
*  but it would seem the White House is not willing to do that at this moment saying they are rightfully [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=397.04s)]
*  stepping in to restore law and order so a real stalemate there [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=401.6s)]
*  even as we see the tension and the clashes playing out in the streets we also have this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=408.48s)]
*  floor of words don't we between state officials like Gavin Newsom the local mayor here Karen Bass [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=412.88000000000005s)]
*  and then the president of the United States we heard from Gavin Newsom today saying he actually [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=418.8s)]
*  is considering suing the Trump administration tomorrow over that move of deploying California [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=423.44s)]
*  National Guard here into Los Angeles that's a move that the governor says is his call to make [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  not the president so I think we could see some legal battles that will play out here this is all [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=436.0s)]
*  kind of unprecedented territory these are things we have not seen in many decades in the United States [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai0KHTJ4SZI&t=442.24s)]
