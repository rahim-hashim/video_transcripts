# Secrets of ancient Pompeii revealed in newly discovered paintings | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI)
*  One more story this half hour to Pompeii where archaeologists have revealed their latest discoveries. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=0.0s)]
*  Large almost life-size paintings, known as frescoes, that show the god of wine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=6.4s)]
*  The discovery comes from a dig that began two years ago and has so far uncovered over 50 rooms in the ancient Roman [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=11.92s)]
*  city. So let's talk to Sophie Hay from the archaeological park of Pompeii who are behind this dig. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Great to have you on the program. So tell me a little more about what actually you discovered here this time around. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=26.16s)]
*  Oh wow, well I mean I honestly I've only been seeing it pretty much myself for the first time [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=33.2s)]
*  today with all the journalists and it is a stunning room. It's a huge kind of banqueting [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=39.52s)]
*  wall. It's got red painted columns and then all the way around as you describe this frieze, this fresco [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=44.88s)]
*  of this sort of initiation rites of joining the cult of Bacchus. So yeah the wine gods, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=52.24s)]
*  you can only imagine how kind of sumptuous and sort of frivolous it all is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=58.08s)]
*  We're showing the pictures, some of what you described and you're right the painting goes [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=64.56s)]
*  all the way around the different walls. Now I think I'm right in saying that some of the characters [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=70.56s)]
*  portrayed are on plinths but in a sense you also, despite that, you sort of get a sense of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=76.08s)]
*  the movement within the images. Yeah no it's really kind of questioning what is reality. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=81.76s)]
*  Are these painted statues? We know in antiquity statues were painted but there's so much movement [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=87.92s)]
*  going on with most of the characters. So there are dancers, there are satires playing flutes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=94.48s)]
*  and so there's so much movement you have to wonder are these real people and I quite like that sort [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=101.92s)]
*  of dubiousness you know would this be a topic of conversation over dinner as well? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=106.8s)]
*  Have you been able to establish how long that painting existed before the eruption of Vesuvius? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=112.8s)]
*  Yeah no we're very short so this is called the second style type of painting in Pompeii and it [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=120.08s)]
*  dates to the mid first century BC so by the time of the eruption it was already over 100 years old [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=125.52s)]
*  so this is like having such an antique room in your house which have not been redecorated [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=133.44s)]
*  and remodeled nearer the time of the eruption so it's a really sort of prestigious [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=138.96s)]
*  fresco to have in your house and because of that also extremely rare which is why the find is [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=144.56s)]
*  doubly more exciting because we have so few examples and the most obvious example in comparison to this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=150.56s)]
*  fresco is in the Villa of the Mysteries where there is a dining room with this scene of the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=157.6s)]
*  initiation rites of the Bacchus cult the religious cult so we have lots of comparison with this one [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=164.24s)]
*  other place but it gives us a little more interesting picture because we have these [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=171.68s)]
*  hunters or hunteresses I should say these women who part of the cult is to go out into the woods [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=177.28s)]
*  kill wild animals and they're eating the raw meat and this is something we haven't got in the Villa [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=184.08s)]
*  of the Mysteries so this this fresco is really important because it's opened up new questions [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  and given us more evidence for the for the various sort of mysterious cults of Bacchus. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=194.56s)]
*  I've only got about 40 seconds left so briefly if you could I mean tell me really briefly how [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=199.44s)]
*  you found this and do you think there are still more treasures to be found? So this forms part [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=204.56s)]
*  the last part of this excavation and it forms sort of one room of this large house that we already [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=210.96s)]
*  have so it was found by removing all the volcanic material and of course there's one third of Pompeii [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=216.24s)]
*  still under complete coverage of the volcanic material from the eruption in 1879 so yeah there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  are plenty more to be found. Well Sophie it's an amazing find and you've described it so wonderfully [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=228.48s)]
*  so thank you for joining us on today's program here on Verified Live. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGhKhMmErjI&t=234.48s)]
