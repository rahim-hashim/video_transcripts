# Why are Pope Francis's apartments sealed? #PopeFrancis #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM)
*  Why are the Pope's apartments sealed? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=0.0s)]
*  When the Pope dies, the Carmelengo becomes the acting head of the Vatican. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=2.0s)]
*  He announces a death and seals the Pope's home with red ribbon and wax. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=5.3s)]
*  This is part of tradition that signals that the Holy See, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=9.0s)]
*  which is the main body of the Catholic Church, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=11.9s)]
*  has entered a period of Sede Vacante, or vacant seat. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=13.9s)]
*  And the doors are only opened again once a new Pope has been chosen. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=17.0s)]
*  The Carmelengo also destroys the Pope's ring and lead seal [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=19.8s)]
*  used to authenticate official documents. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=23.0s)]
*  This is to prevent anyone else using the ring. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkc_X_X8wZM&t=25.0s)]
