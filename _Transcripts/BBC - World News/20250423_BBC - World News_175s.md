# Turkeyâ€™s largest city Istanbul rocked by 6.2-magnitude earthquake | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0)
*  An earthquake measured at 6.0 has struck Istanbul in Turkey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=0.0s)]
*  Our correspondent there, Ola Goorin, says buildings have been shaken today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=5.64s)]
*  She had to run from her apartment, in fact, and I spoke to her a short time ago about [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  what she experienced. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  I've been living here for six years and I have felt previous earthquakes inside my building [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  and it has tended to sway a little for a few seconds and then settle. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=21.32s)]
*  What I heard and felt this morning was very, very different. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=27.319999999999997s)]
*  The building really started to shake quite violently and I could hear a sort of a rumble. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=32.0s)]
*  I must say, standing there, I was waiting to see the walls cracking around me, but fortunately [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=37.96s)]
*  that didn't happen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=45.72s)]
*  I left the building quickly along with all my neighbours. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=46.72s)]
*  Here in my district, which is in the European side of Istanbul, people were running out [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=50.84s)]
*  of buildings, gathering in the streets, being careful, Christian, to stand away from the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  buildings themselves. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=62.44s)]
*  And there was a degree of shock that was very visible. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  I saw one woman who is in tears. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=67.24s)]
*  People were calling relatives, getting calls from relatives, checking to see if they were [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=70.64s)]
*  OK and the big quake that you mentioned, 6.2, was the main one, but there were two smaller [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=76.8s)]
*  ones recorded before that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=84.72s)]
*  In fact, just in the last few minutes, I was briefly back inside my building to collect [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=86.72s)]
*  some equipment and as I stood inside the doorway, I could feel another aftershock. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=92.0s)]
*  Now it was much less than what we had felt previously, but it appears that the city has [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=98.28s)]
*  been fortunate, if I can put it that way, because these quakes and aftershocks were [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  in the Sea of Marmara, which is off the coast of Istanbul to the west, so it wasn't actually [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=111.0s)]
*  inside the city and that appears to be why we do not have any reports at the moment of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=118.76s)]
*  injuries or deaths or of buildings collapsing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  And if that had happened, we would certainly know by now, because the system here is quite [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=129.6s)]
*  quick and efficient and the emergency disaster agency would put out notifications very fast. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=134.2s)]
*  So it appears as if the city has had an escape this time, but of course it renews the fears [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=141.2s)]
*  that people here live with that the big one could be coming at any stage and there will [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  certainly be more fear here now of that happening. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=153.6s)]
*  All going therefore is in Istanbul, two or three quakes that were felt, but the Interior [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  Minister saying in the last hour that there'd be more than 50 recorded through the course [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=162.12s)]
*  of the day, so certainly that will put nerves on edge in Turkey's biggest city. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJq4-kwXXn0&t=166.95999999999998s)]
