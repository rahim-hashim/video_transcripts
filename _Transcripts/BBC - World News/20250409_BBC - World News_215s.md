Video Description: European Union member states have voted to impose an extra 25% tariffs on US imports, affecting €20.9bn (£18bn) worth of goods.
 
The tariffs are in response to the 25% import taxes US President Donald Trump imposed on all steel and aluminium that came into force in mid-March.
 
It is unclear which goods the EU is targeting, but the new tariffs will come into effect from 15 April.

# EU imposes extra 25% tariffs on US imports | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps)
*  In the last 30 minutes, the European Union countries has approved the bloc's first countermeasures [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=0.0s)]
*  against President Trump's tariffs, joining China and Canada in pushing back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=5.4s)]
*  The European Union is set to impose extra duties, mostly of 25 percent, on a range of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=9.64s)]
*  U.S. imports in response specifically to the U.S. metals tariffs. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=14.56s)]
*  It's still assessing how to respond to the car and border levies, and the broader levies [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=18.76s)]
*  that the countries face. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=23.28s)]
*  Now, these new tariffs will take effect from the 15th of April. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Let's hear now from David Hennig of the European Center for International Political Economy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=28.12s)]
*  He's been following developments closely in Brussels. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=32.6s)]
*  David, what can you tell us about the countermeasures? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, these are measures, as you say, against the steel and aluminum tariffs. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=37.64s)]
*  So this is going back a couple of tariffs ago. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=42.8s)]
*  And these are measures actually, first part of it is reviving measures that were in place [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=46.2s)]
*  during Trump's first term. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=50.24s)]
*  And then there are some extra measures to come in place, which are because the steel [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=52.6s)]
*  and aluminum tariffs go further this time round. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=57.54s)]
*  The EU is still considering the actions it will take against the newer tariffs, those [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=61.54s)]
*  that came on automotive and the general tariff of 20 percent. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=66.06s)]
*  There's a little bit of uncertainty here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=70.74s)]
*  Unlike, I think, in China, there's not a desire in Brussels to escalate this trade war beyond [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=72.1s)]
*  a certain point. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=79.22s)]
*  There's worry about the potential damage to the EU's own economy from doing that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=80.22s)]
*  David, we are hearing President Donald Trump digging in, posting on social media just now, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=86.58000000000001s)]
*  be cool, everything will work out well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=91.22s)]
*  The USA will be bigger and better than ever before, adding in capital letters, this is [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=93.78s)]
*  a great time to buy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=98.30000000000001s)]
*  So when we have other countries looking at the U.S. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=99.98s)]
*  maneuvers and deciding retaliation or negotiation, how does that stance from President Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=101.9s)]
*  affect the calculus? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=106.86000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that, you know, in part that is, you know, we pass over the fact that President [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=109.86000000000001s)]
*  Trump is playing to his, you know, rather worried political base here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=114.98s)]
*  I think that the EU is hoping that if you keep retaliation under control at some point, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=120.14s)]
*  the talks will start at some point, President Trump will be forced to make some deals. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  The EU will be one of the most obvious deals that he has to make after, for example, Japan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=129.02s)]
*  And that at that point, if you haven't gone too far, there will be not so much to unwind, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  not so much damage will have been done. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=139.7s)]
*  And some of these tariffs that the EU is talking about won't come into force until [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=141.58s)]
*  December on soybeans. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=144.9s)]
*  So they're giving a forecast of what will come. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  So I think the EU is playing a longer game here and thinking that at some point there [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  will be talks, there will be a deal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  But at that point, will the U.S. in your eyes be a credible negotiating partner? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=159.74s)]
*  Well, right now, the U.S. is a credible negotiating partner. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=163.46s)]
*  As far as the U.S. is concerned, they wouldn't know who to talk to within the administration, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=167.34s)]
*  who actually has the ear of the president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=171.26s)]
*  Trade policy in Brussels is run as a pretty tight ship. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=176.38s)]
*  It's run pretty firmly. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=179.73999999999998s)]
*  They know what they're doing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=181.17999999999998s)]
*  They have a playbook that they use. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  You're looking over at D.C. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=185.14s)]
*  The EU is used to working in D.C., but it looks over now and it says, who do we even [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  call? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=192.14s)]
*  Who do we have this conversation with? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=193.14s)]
*  At this stage, it's totally unclear to them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  So in part, there's also this idea, look, we're going to have to look elsewhere because [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  we can't rely on the U.S. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=201.06s)]
*  We just don't know what's going on there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  And there's some resignation here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  I think that the world is changing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  We're going to have to update our playbook, but it's taking time for them to work through [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=210.86s)]
*  and they don't want to pass. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K9pisnpps&t=213.86s)]
