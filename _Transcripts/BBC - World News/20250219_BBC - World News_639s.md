# Trump calls Zelensky a 'dictator' as he hits back at 'disinformation' criticism | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0)
*  President Trump in the last few moments has slammed Ukraine's President Zelensky [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=0.0s)]
*  as a dictator without elections. In the past few minutes he has posted this on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=5.64s)]
*  his Truth Social platform. Let me just take you through some of the detail. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=11.0s)]
*  Quite a lengthy post as you can see there. He says that President Zelensky [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=14.84s)]
*  refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls. He's claiming that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=19.88s)]
*  President Zelensky has about a 4% rating. Polls suggest it's 57%. He goes on, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=25.72s)]
*  the only thing he was good at was playing Biden like a fiddle. He then calls [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=32.04s)]
*  President Zelensky a dictator without elections. Zelensky better move fast or [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=36.56s)]
*  he is not going to have a country left. He goes on, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=41.08s)]
*  In the meantime we're successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=44.12s)]
*  something all admit only Trump and the Trump administration can do. Biden never [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=47.48s)]
*  tried, he claims. Europe has failed to bring peace and Zelensky probably wants [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=52.68s)]
*  to keep the gravy train going. President Trump goes on, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  He also calls Vladimir Zelensky a moderately successful comedian, talking [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=62.12s)]
*  America into spending billions of dollars to go into a war that couldn't be one. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=77.64s)]
*  He says the US has spent 200 billion dollars more than Europe and Europe's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=82.44s)]
*  money is guaranteed while the US will get nothing back. Well, all of this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=86.28s)]
*  happening now as a number of discussions continue about the future of Ukraine, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=93.64s)]
*  some of them without Ukraine involved. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin has [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=100.28s)]
*  delivered a pretty positive verdict on Tuesday's talks between the US and Russia. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=106.44s)]
*  Those are the talks that took place in Saudi Arabia, saying he rates them highly. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=110.44s)]
*  Speaking to reporters earlier, Mr Putin said the purpose of that meeting was to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=115.52s)]
*  increase trust. He said he is happy to meet President Trump and there has been [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  some indication in Moscow today it could even be as early as this month. He says [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  he expects Ukraine will take part in talks at some point. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=130.56s)]
*  Yes, I have been informed. I rate them highly. There are results. The first thing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  I would like to say is that we have agreed to resume the normal work of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=144.72s)]
*  diplomatic agencies. The constant expulsion of diplomats from Washington [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=147.92s)]
*  and Moscow does not lead to anything good. If this goes on, only cleaners will [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=152.08s)]
*  work in these buildings, whose work should be also appreciated, but this is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=157.12s)]
*  not what diplomatic missions are created for. Well, Ukraine's leader, President [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=161.28s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky, had earlier said President Trump was living in a bubble of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=167.52s)]
*  Russian disinformation. Ukraine was excluded from those talks in Saudi Arabia [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=171.44s)]
*  between America and Russian officials. And here is President Zelensky speaking [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=176.32s)]
*  earlier. Since we are talking about 4%, we have seen this disinformation. We [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=181.04s)]
*  understand that it is coming from Russia. We understand and we have evidence that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=189.2s)]
*  these numbers are being discussed between America and Russia. It is [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=193.6s)]
*  unfortunate that President Trump, and with great respect for him as the leader [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=197.52s)]
*  of the American people who constantly support us, unfortunately lives in this [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=201.28s)]
*  disinformation space. Joining me now are our correspondents Nomiya Iqbal, who is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  in Washington, and also Vitaly Shevchenko from BBC Monitoring, who has been [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=210.4s)]
*  following Putin's remarks. But first to Nomiya. Nomiya, one of my guests earlier [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=215.12s)]
*  was saying that we have to pay attention to what President Trump does rather than [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=220.96s)]
*  what he says, but there does seem to be a war of words at the moment, and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=224.64s)]
*  certainly looking at those latest comments on his truth social platform. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=228.88s)]
*  What's your analysis of what he said? Well, yeah, I think that that's not, you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=233.27999999999997s)]
*  know, entirely incorrect. It's what he does, not what he says. But what he says [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=239.76s)]
*  is hugely significant. Do remember he's in his last term in office. But look, I [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=243.2s)]
*  don't think anyone was under the illusion that things were going to be [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=248.32s)]
*  under President Trump as they were under President Biden when it comes to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=251.52s)]
*  Ukraine. His comments are still pretty extraordinary. They're very long. But [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=255.68s)]
*  the fact that it's important to sort of first of all stress that Kiev last held [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  an election in 2019, has been unable to stage another one since Russia's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  invasion in early 2022. But saying he's a dictator without elections is quite [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  extraordinary because I don't think that those are words he'd necessarily use [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=278.0s)]
*  about the Russian President Vladimir Putin. In fact, I think that's something [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=281.36s)]
*  that has stood out with Donald Trump again. It was similar to his first term. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  He seems to criticize everyone but Putin. I mean, last week, Mr. Trump had [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=288.48s)]
*  accused President Joe Biden of starting the war in Ukraine. He wants to have [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  this closer alignment to Russia. I think there was always an expectation that he [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=296.88s)]
*  was going to say something. He's in Miami at the moment on a business [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=303.04s)]
*  meeting but it's not particularly helpful considering he's got his special [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  envoy to Ukraine, Mr. Kellogg, in the country right now holding talks with [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Zelensky. Yes, Keith Kellogg, who says his mission there is to listen to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  Ukraine's concerns. So a bit of a mismatch between that and what President [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump is saying. What sort of reaction are you getting there in the US? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=327.76s)]
*  Probably not to these latest comments. They've only just happened. But what kind [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=331.84s)]
*  of reaction are you seeing there in the US, especially among Republican [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  politicians, to the way President Trump is handling this? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=338.88s)]
*  Well, the aid that has been sent to Ukraine so far was passed by Congress. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=344.88s)]
*  So there is bipartisan support for helping Ukraine. There will certainly be [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  Republicans who are uneasy with what Donald Trump is saying but in terms of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  them actually saying anything publicly is probably going to be a bit of a [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=357.36s)]
*  stretch. The party is incredibly loyal to Donald Trump, even more so now. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  Democrats on the other hand, of course, they are very different. They have been [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  alarmed by what Mr. Trump said in regards to blaming Mr. Zelensky for the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  war. Senator Chris Murphy for Connecticut, he serves on the Foreign Relations [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=375.04s)]
*  Committee. He said, I'm going to quote what he said, he accused the president of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=380.24s)]
*  lying to the American people, of essentially rewriting history. As I [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=383.92s)]
*  mentioned, Mr. Trump last week even accused President Biden of starting the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=388.24s)]
*  war. But I think something that is probably important to add here is that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=394.0s)]
*  in a foreign policy aside, and if you add the domestic angle in, Donald Trump [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  campaigned on the promise to end the war in Ukraine. Just recently I spent a bit [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=404.0s)]
*  of time in Pennsylvania, it's a swing state that Donald Trump won last year. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  A lot of the voters that I spoke to, those who were for Trump, those who were [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  against, there was some overlap in terms of Ukraine, most of them saying that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=418.88s)]
*  they didn't think that the US should continue being involved in Ukraine. So [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump, as far as he's concerned, he's delivering on a campaign promise. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=428.88s)]
*  But of course this reset of relations with Moscow, the concern for Ukraine and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=432.56s)]
*  Europe is that it might come at a huge cost for Ukraine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=436.8s)]
*  Okay, Nomiya, thank you very much. Let's bring in Vitaly Shevchenko from BBC [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=441.2s)]
*  Monitoring. Vitaly, looking at what President Trump has just said, what he's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=444.64s)]
*  been saying in recent days and what President Putin has been saying, are you [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=449.12s)]
*  seeing any kind of mirroring in the language of the two men? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, Anita, it's so tempting to speak about what is going on, what they're [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=459.76s)]
*  saying in superlatives and epithets. It's truly extraordinary. The Russian [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=464.56s)]
*  and American positions on Ukraine specifically, they're almost perfectly [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=473.76s)]
*  aligned. First we heard from Pete Hexeth, the defence secretary, say that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=479.2s)]
*  NATO membership for Ukraine ruled out, getting territories back ruled out. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=488.24s)]
*  And now Donald Trump is saying that Vladimir Zelensky is a dictator, he lost [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  his mandate and Ukraine started the war. Well, my job is to monitor the Russian [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  media and that's what they've been saying for years. And it's truly extraordinary [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=507.68s)]
*  to hear that come from Donald Trump. Now, there are opinions and there are also [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=513.04s)]
*  facts. Of course, we can argue about how successful or otherwise [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=519.52s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky was as a comedian, but in terms of his popularity, the opinion [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=524.1600000000001s)]
*  polls that I've seen, credible opinion polls from Ukraine, they suggest that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=531.6s)]
*  his approval ratings, Vladimir Zelensky, he enjoys a slightly bigger approval [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=538.48s)]
*  rating than Donald Trump in America. And in terms of elections, Ukrainian law [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=545.2s)]
*  specifically forbids holding presidential, parliamentary, local elections at a time [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=552.24s)]
*  of war. So these remarks, they will come as a shock to many Ukrainians who also, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  well, they'll have a huge issue with Donald Trump saying, well, it's Ukraine [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=568.0s)]
*  that started the war. In terms of how you wrote back from these remarks, it's really [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  difficult to imagine an easy way of doing that. And it's beginning to look like Ukraine [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=579.92s)]
*  is losing or has lost America as an ally. And what Donald Trump has been saying for days [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  suggests that, well, he's much friendlier towards Vladimir Putin than he is towards [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky. Briefly, Vitaly, what is the Russian media saying in response to all [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=600.96s)]
*  of this? Give us a sense of that. Oh, they're overjoyed. They are saying that this is [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=606.72s)]
*  very good news for us. They haven't really embraced Donald Trump as a friend. They're [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=613.44s)]
*  saying that still he still has America's interest at his heart, but he's clearly driving a wedge [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=617.2s)]
*  right into the heart of the Western alliance. And one commentator on Russia's Channel One says, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=624.0s)]
*  it works for us. Vitaly, thank you very much. Vitaly Shevchenko and Nomiya Iqbal there in Washington. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=631.36s)]
*  Thank you both very much. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJyDthPhB0&t=637.76s)]
