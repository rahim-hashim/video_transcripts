Video Description: Thousands are protesting in Venezuela's capital in a bid to topple President Nicolás Maduro's government.
Four people reportedly died in overnight clashes ahead of the opposition protests.
Mr Maduro was sworn in for a second term in early January, after a poll considered a sham by much of the international community.
Venezuela has been in economic freefall for a number of years under his leadership.
Hyperinflation and key shortages, including of food, has forced millions out of the country.
