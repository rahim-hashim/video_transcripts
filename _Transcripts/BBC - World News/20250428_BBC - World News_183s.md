Video Description: The members of Kenya's security forces who shot dead anti-tax protesters at the country's parliament in June have been identified by the BBC.
 
The BBC's analysis of more than 5,000 images also shows that those killed there were unarmed and not posing a threat.
 
The East African nation's constitution guarantees the right to peaceful protest, and the deaths caused a public outcry.
 
Despite a parliamentary committee ordering Kenya's Independent Policing Oversight Authority to investigate the deaths on the streets of the capital, Nairobi - and make public its findings - no report regarding the killings at parliament has yet been issued and no-one has been held to account.

*  A new investigation by BBC Africa Eye has exposed a Kenyan soldier who shot protesters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=0.0s)]
*  at Kenya's parliament last year. Demonstrations against a proposed finance bill spiralled [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  out of control when thousands of young Kenyans flocked to the parliament to stop the bill [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=12.96s)]
*  at its final reading. Renuka Salina reports in a warning this story does contain images [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=17.52s)]
*  some viewers may find distressing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  This is Eric. He's caught in a stampede heading out of Kenya's parliament. He reaches the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=26.04s)]
*  exit and then... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=34.2s)]
*  Eric Shieny never made it home. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=39.74s)]
*  He was a 27-year-old student at the University of Nairobi. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=45.68s)]
*  On June 25th, he joined a protest against the government's 2024 finance bill. While [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=49.04s)]
*  it claimed increasing taxes would address the country's growing debt problem, hundreds [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=59.32s)]
*  of thousands of Kenyans disagreed. The protesters' aim was to occupy the parliament, to stop [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=64.4s)]
*  the bill passing into law. But along the way, they met tear gas, truncheons and even gunfire. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=71.64s)]
*  Eric was one of at least three people shot dead at Kenya's parliament. But by who? In [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=80.04s)]
*  his case, the answers in the video of his final steps. The moment before he shot, an [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  armed man steps into view. We've mapped this and 5,000 photos and videos like it to reconstruct [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  what happened that day. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=99.76s)]
*  The second after this moment is captured, gunfire is heard and Eric's body falls to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=103.04s)]
*  the floor. While we can't see his face, we can see his uniform has distinctive features. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=108.0s)]
*  We compared those features to more than 150 images taken at the site within 10 minutes [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  of the shooting. Only one man was a match. Him. Several senior officers in Kenya's defence [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=122.08s)]
*  forces confirmed his uniform is that of the Kenyan army, a force not known for turning [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=131.08s)]
*  its guns on civilians. Our investigation found this soldier shot Eric Shieny as he [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=137.28s)]
*  was running away from parliament. We put these allegations to the Kenya Defence Forces, the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=144.0s)]
*  KDF. They said, The authority currently investigating the events has not forwarded any request to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=149.8s)]
*  look into any KDF personnel involved in the operations. The KDF remains fully committed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=156.84s)]
*  to upholding the rule of law and continues to operate strictly within its constitutional [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49A-TmnHBI&t=162.88s)]
