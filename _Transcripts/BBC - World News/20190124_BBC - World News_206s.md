# Syria War: On the frontline with SDF fighting IS  - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 24, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4)
*  After years of waging war on the so-called Islamic State, the Syrian Democratic Forces have their full cornered. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=0.0s)]
*  IS has lost most of its territory. These may be its final days. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=6.96s)]
*  They march like an army from another age on the way to destroy a medieval caliphate, but with 21st century air power. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=11.64s)]
*  We're just south of the village Sousa, and this really is the very front line. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=30.16s)]
*  Now the Islamic State used to stretch all the way from Libya to Iraq and across Syria. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's been reduced to this tiny pocket, just 30 square kilometers. And south of here [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=40.36s)]
*  there are only two villages remaining still under IS control. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=46.0s)]
*  America will soon withdraw its support from these fighters. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=52.24s)]
*  This utter ruin marks the Islamic State's retreat. In the hurry to get out, American airstrikes have jumped by a quarter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=60.0s)]
*  This has destroyed their strongholds, but no one here thinks they're truly gone. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=67.52s)]
*  With the coalition, we've defeated the Islamic State many times, but they are religious extremists. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=76.28s)]
*  Their ideology remains. Our fighters are trying to escape with civilians. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=81.92s)]
*  They have sleeper cells in Syria, Iraq and all over the world. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=85.92s)]
*  So IS are retreating into the shadows and to the desert west of here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=91.0s)]
*  There's still fighting to be done. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=97.0s)]
*  Under the cover of more airstrikes, we join a night operation into the last Islamic State territory ahead. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=101.0s)]
*  There's a mixture of bravado and fear. The fighters are men and boys from local villages and towns. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=108.0s)]
*  They move at a cautious crawl. Some 2,000 IS fighters remain, including at least 20 British extremists. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=120.0s)]
*  With homemade grenades and their bedding over their shoulders, they swagger on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=128.0s)]
*  Bit by bit, armored bulldozers clear the way. But soon they get bogged down. They can go no further tonight. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=136.0s)]
*  Syria is a country of many people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=149.0s)]
*  Syria is a country of constant mourning and near daily funerals. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=153.0s)]
*  The family of 25-year-old Derek Khalil gather to mourn him. He died on the front line last week. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=162.0s)]
*  It's the Kurds and Arabs who fought this war against IS and died and the thousands doing so. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=170.0s)]
*  And before the battle is won, more will die. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=176.0s)]
*  Some fought for revenge and IS has been repaid in blood. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=181.0s)]
*  Islamic State is almost beaten. Western troops will soon leave. These men and boys will again stand alone. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=185.0s)]
*  It could prove to be a precarious victory. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZq5kAglae4&t=193.0s)]
