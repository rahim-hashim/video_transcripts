# Did tourists cause a 'rice crisis' shortage in Japan? #Rice #Japan #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU)
*  Japan is in the middle of a rice crisis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=0.0s)]
*  The price of this bag has doubled from $14 to nearly 30 since last year. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=2.32s)]
*  There have been queues of people lining up outside big supermarkets trying to get their hands on a bag of rice. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  So how did we get here? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=13.56s)]
*  The rice harvest was compromised in 2023 because of extremely hot weather. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=14.6s)]
*  In 2024, Japan received a record number of visitors. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=18.84s)]
*  Nearly 14 million tourists came in and delved into the country's cuisine, and that put more pressure on rice demands. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=22.92s)]
*  Also in 2024, after an earthquake in the southwest, families were jolted when a warning about a megaquake to possibly follow came in. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=29.88s)]
*  That triggered panic buying and hoarding. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=38.76s)]
*  But the problem is more structural and it goes back decades. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=41.12s)]
*  Japan tightly regulates the production of rice. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=44.0s)]
*  Essentially, the idea is that farmers produce just enough for the domestic market. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=46.6s)]
*  But it's backfired with one expert calling it disastrous. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=51.36s)]
*  There's also been a lot of confusion in the traditional supply chains recently after rice started being sold online. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=54.36s)]
*  The current Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi has vowed to bring the prices down and to modify the supply chain. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=60.04s)]
*  More rice has been coming into shops, but not nearly enough. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOFImWqygU&t=65.76s)]
