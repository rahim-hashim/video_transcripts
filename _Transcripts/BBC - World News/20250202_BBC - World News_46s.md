# How the Grammys were different this year. #Grammys #LosAngeles #BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_pBCgioYA)
*  Welcome to the red carpet at the Grammys in Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_pBCgioYA&t=0.0s)]
*  This is music's biggest night, but there's really going to be a different feel about award season in this city now this year. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_pBCgioYA&t=3.44s)]
*  Just a couple of weeks ago, LA was devastated by wildfires and thousands of people lost their homes and livelihoods. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_pBCgioYA&t=10.28s)]
*  So there was a debate over whether the Grammys should go ahead at all, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_pBCgioYA&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  because some in the music industry felt it wouldn't be right to have all the lavish celebrations so soon after a crisis. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_pBCgioYA&t=20.92s)]
*  Organisers decided the show must go on, so the artists will get their rewards, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_pBCgioYA&t=27.56s)]
*  but the evening also doubles as an event to raise money for people who lost their homes and honour the efforts of firefighters. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_pBCgioYA&t=32.16s)]
*  A lot of the usual after parties are cancelled, so there's a bit more of a sombre feel here after such an unprecedented disaster for the city. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv_pBCgioYA&t=38.68s)]
