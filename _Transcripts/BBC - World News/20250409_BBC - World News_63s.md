*  Now, we are just going to briefly return to our main story here tonight, tariffs and the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=0.0s)]
*  global turmoil that we've been telling you about, because just literally in the last [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=4.5s)]
*  couple of minutes, we're hearing that President Trump has announced that there will be a 90-day [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=8.36s)]
*  pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China. He's saying, let's find out [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=14.32s)]
*  more from Simon Jack. What do we know, Simon? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=19.68s)]
*  It looks like the US has blinked, because in the last few minutes, I'm just looking [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=21.76s)]
*  at the markets now. They've rocketed up the US stock market up 6% on that news, that they [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=25.96s)]
*  will pause for 90 days for countries that have not retaliated. He is putting tariffs [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=31.04s)]
*  up on China, but for countries like the UK, which have not retaliated, there will be a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=36.08s)]
*  90-day pause. And as I say, the markets are taking a huge sigh of relief from that. They [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=41.0s)]
*  think there's time in that time to do some deals, so it won't be so punitive. But just [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=45.72s)]
*  a real example of just how turbulent this is. Literally, since we've been on air, a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=51.2s)]
*  massive U-turn from the US government, but as I say, only on those countries that haven't [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=56.28s)]
*  retaliated. That, by the way, includes the UK. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPWQsJPAEw&t=60.800000000000004s)]
