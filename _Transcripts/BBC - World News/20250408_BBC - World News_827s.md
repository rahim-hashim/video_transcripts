Video Description: A full blown trade war between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - seems even closer as President Trump threatens to impose further tariffs on China.
 
China says it will "fight to the end" after US president Donald Trump threatened to hit Beijing with an extra 50% tariff if it doesn't withdraw its retaliatory levy on Tuesday.
 
Beijing's commerce ministry accuses the Trump administration of blackmail and says his tariffs are "a typical unilateral bullying practice".

China's Foreign Ministry has held a press conference and said "trade wars have no winners".

In a social media post on Monday, Trump gave China until Tuesday to scrap its countermeasure or face the 50% tax.

# US President Trump threatens new 50% tariffs on China | BBC News

*  Hello, I'm Lauren Taylor. A full-blown trade war between the world's two biggest economies, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=0.0s)]
*  the US and China, seems even closer as President Trump threatens to impose further tariffs [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]

*  on Tuesday. Beijing's Commerce Ministry accuses the Trump administration of blackmail and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=21.56s)]
*  China says his tariffs are a typical unilateral bullying practice. China's Foreign Ministry [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=26.88s)]
*  has held a news conference and said trade wars have no winners. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=32.76s)]
*  The US abuse of tariffs seriously infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=38.0s)]
*  countries, violates WTO rules, hurts the rules-based multilateral trading system and destabilizes [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  global economic order. It is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=53.6s)]
*  bullying. It is rejected by the whole international community. China strongly deplores and firmly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=60.4s)]
*  opposes this. Let me stress once again that trade wars and tariff wars have no winners [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=67.76s)]
*  and protectionism has no way out. The Chinese people never create trouble, neither do we [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=77.08s)]
*  fear trouble. Pressuring, threatening or extorting China is not the right way to engage with [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  us. China will do what is necessary to firmly safeguard our legitimate and lawful rights [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=91.2s)]
*  and interests. If the US insists on waging the tariffs war [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  and trade war regardless of the interests of both countries and the international community, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=105.44s)]
*  China will play along to the end. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=111.76s)]
*  I speak to our correspondent in Beijing, Stephen McDonald. How big an impact is China expecting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=113.96s)]
*  if this does continue into a full blown trade war? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=120.48s)]
*  I think they know what's going to happen but the government in Beijing has decided it can't [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=126.24s)]
*  stand down, it can't ignore these threats from Donald Trump which they've labelled [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=132.46s)]
*  as blackmail. I mean the government here has said that the idea that Donald Trump's tariffs [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  are reciprocal is ridiculous, instead saying they're the act of a bully and they've threatened [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=144.9s)]
*  their own countermeasures yet again if Donald Trump makes good with his threats. So how [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=150.9s)]
*  might things pan out over the next couple of days? Well today is the deadline imposed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=156.62s)]
*  by Donald Trump for the Chinese government to withdraw its last round of tariffs on US [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=162.4s)]
*  goods which were in response to the last round of tariffs from Donald Trump. Well clearly [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=168.26s)]
*  the Chinese government is not going to back down on that so we move forward to the next [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=173.48s)]
*  stage. Another 50% tariffs imposed on all Chinese goods going to the US, that makes [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=177.34s)]
*  it 104% tariffs on all Chinese goods going into the US, that's absolutely enormous. Then [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=184.94s)]
*  we're going to have another response from China which again is going to spook the markets, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=192.66s)]
*  again is going to hit every single US company that wants to sell into this huge market here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=198.18s)]
*  But what might that sort of Beijing response be? We don't actually know yet. However there [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=204.54s)]
*  is one Xinhua journalist who on his private social media post said, this is someone with [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=209.8s)]
*  good connections in the Communist Party, that he expects the response could be along the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=217.72s)]
*  lines of significant tariff increases on US agricultural products, so that's soybeans [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  and sorghum, a complete ban on US poultry from entering China, suspending US-China cooperation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  on the fentanyl crisis and if you can believe it, banning the import of all US movies into [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=236.16s)]
*  China. So it's just going to keep getting ratcheted up and up it seems until there can [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=245.04s)]
*  be some sort of a breakthrough. And you mentioned the effect on the markets, China's also been [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=250.64s)]
*  trying to have some measures in place to shore up the markets, hasn't it? Yeah well yesterday [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  there was a complete bloodbath here, especially in Hong Kong which saw its biggest drop since [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=262.36s)]
*  1997, I mean that far back. Now today the Chinese government has intervened using various [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=267.06s)]
*  companies that it controls, including a sovereign wealth fund to buy up shares and that's propped [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=275.88s)]
*  the market up a bit and it's sort of gone up and down, but certainly not gone through [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=281.8s)]
*  the floor again as it may have happened if they hadn't intervened. However, even with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=286.12s)]
*  the deep pockets of the Chinese government you'd have to think that this might just be [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=292.26s)]
*  a temporary fix and if the trade war keeps worsening on and on, they're not going to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=296.88s)]
*  be able to keep propping things up in this way. Steve McDonald, thank you very much indeed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=303.72s)]
*  President Trump has insisted he has no plans to suspend his tariffs, saying they were having [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=310.04s)]
*  the desired effect and the United States would end up the winner. Our North America correspondent [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=314.32s)]
*  David Willis reports. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=318.6s)]
*  A closing bell on Wall Street marking the end of another torrid day of trading. The [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=321.6s)]
*  S&P 500 index rebounded briefly on suggestions the US was about to hit the pause button on [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=327.16s)]
*  its trade tariffs, only to fall again when the rumour proved to be false. The Dow also [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=333.24s)]
*  finished down nearly 350 points. Pausing, it seems, isn't part of the plan. Flanked [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=339.04s)]
*  by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump threatened further tariffs on [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=345.48s)]
*  China if it failed to drop its retaliatory measures against the US. Such a move would [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=350.72s)]
*  subject Chinese imports to levies of 104 per cent. The only solution, said the president, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  was a trade deal on terms considerably more favourable to the US. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=362.72s)]
*  We have $36 trillion of debt for a reason. And the reason is that people allowed it to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=367.04s)]
*  get that way. So we'll be talking to China, we'll be talking to a lot of different countries [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  and I think, you know, if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the United States, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=380.48s)]
*  not a good deal for others, this is America first. It's now America first. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=387.0s)]
*  The global response to Mr Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcement has been unequivocal. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=392.48s)]
*  Since last Wednesday, trillions of dollars have been wiped off share prices as America's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=397.6s)]
*  key trading partners have mulled their response. For its part, China also insists it isn't [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  backing down. Following Mr Trump's threat of tariffs on top of tariffs, it accused the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=408.8s)]
*  United States of blackmail and economic bullying. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said China had [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=413.8s)]
*  vowed to fight the tariffs to the end. But amid growing warnings of a possible recession, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=419.08s)]
*  some in Donald Trump's inner circle are starting to express disquiet, posting on X, the leading [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=424.91999999999996s)]
*  hedge fund manager and Donald Trump cheerleader, Bill Ackman, called for a 90-day pause in [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=430.56s)]
*  the imposition of reciprocal tariffs that are due to come into effect tomorrow, warning [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=436.52s)]

*  With baseline 10% tariffs already in place on all imports into the US, the trade secretary [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=447.44s)]
*  was asked was there any way the UK could escape? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=454.56s)]
*  The existing trade relationship is a strong one, a fair one, a balanced one. I believe [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=458.12s)]
*  we can make that deeper, go further on both sides, and I believe that should be based [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=461.88s)]
*  on removing tariffs. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=466.32s)]
*  Right. So is that a red line for you? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=468.12s)]

*  Traders in Asia were holding their breath as the markets opened there amid warnings [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=476.84s)]
*  that the effects of a global trade war involving the world's two largest economies could soon [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=480.84s)]
*  start to spread. David Willis, BBC News. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=486.96s)]
*  Our Asia business reporter, Muka Oye, is in Singapore and has the latest market reaction [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  from there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=495.64s)]
*  It was a much calmer day, with most Asian stock markets managing to make some recoveries, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=497.0s)]
*  including Japan's Nikkei 225 ending the day more than 5% higher. Other stock markets, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=501.24s)]
*  including South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong, even mainland China, where there are fears [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=506.6s)]
*  of that escalating trade war with Washington, share prices managed to rise. There are stock [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=512.28s)]
*  markets where we saw further losses, though, including in Taiwan and also in Indonesia, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=518.32s)]
*  which was shut for a public holiday on Monday. It's also important to emphasize that just [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=523.4s)]
*  because we saw this recovery, that does not mean that investors think that it's all back [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=528.0s)]
*  to normal. There are still concerns over those escalating tensions, especially between the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=532.28s)]
*  world's two biggest economies, and economists are still warning that these tariffs could [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=537.68s)]
*  possibly push up prices in the United States, pushing it and possibly even a global economy [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=542.28s)]
*  But at least for now, trading has calmed down, and that's because the stock market represents [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=549.36s)]
*  what investors think these companies are worth and what their future profits may be. And [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=554.44s)]
*  because of the impact of those latest tariffs on their future profits, that's why we saw [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=559.76s)]
*  that sell-off, but now shares are trading at the level where investors think is appropriate. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=565.08s)]
*  With me is our business presenter, Sally Bundock. Sally, there's been a bit of a rebound in some [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  areas, bringing us the very latest on the reactions of markets to this latest escalation [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=574.96s)]
*  in the US-China trade war. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=578.36s)]
*  Yes, across Europe we're seeing a very similar picture to what happened in Asia that Mariko [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=580.36s)]
*  has just outlined. So a bit of a rebound, a bit of a – rally is too strong a word, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=584.96s)]
*  it's not a rally – but a little bit of recovery compared to the losses we saw across Europe [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=591.24s)]
*  yesterday. So this time yesterday it was heavy, heavy losses all the way across Europe. In [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  London down 5%, France 6%, Germany much more. They all ended the day around 4% lower. So [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=601.52s)]
*  today they're all hovering around a percent higher. So they've not quite recovered the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=608.52s)]
*  ground they lost. And it marks the end, what's going on in Asia and Europe today, of a three-day [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=612.28s)]
*  market rout, which is a little bit of a relief, but it's calm, but it doesn't mean the storm [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=619.56s)]
*  has gone away by any means. As you have been telling our viewers, the spat between China [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=626.88s)]
*  and the United States has really intensified. The war of words is hotting up and at the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=632.3599999999999s)]
*  moment no one is blinking. So that's the problem for markets. They don't know what's going [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  to happen next. They've got no clarity in what's ahead and that's why people are very [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=642.68s)]
*  nervous. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=647.68s)]
*  And for ordinary people, what are these uncertainties on the markets translating to? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=648.52s)]
*  On financial markets, unless they're actually going to cash in their shares or start using [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=653.44s)]
*  their pension today, it's not an issue because of course for most people their pensions are [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=659.24s)]
*  impacted by what's going on at the moment. But if that's a long-term investment, you're [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=665.2s)]
*  not retiring for several years to come, you should see some upside and some recovery and [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=669.8s)]
*  the investments for long-term usually see some gain. So that's the positive and the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  optimistic view on this. But of course if you are going to cash in stocks and shares [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=681.0799999999999s)]
*  right now or move money around today, you've got to think very wisely about what you're [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  going to do with that because of course the losses are still pretty grim. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  And how does all this compare, this particular kind of wave of uncertainty and markets falling [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=695.52s)]
*  like this or volatility anyway, how does it compare with say the Covid crisis or the financial [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=699.8s)]
*  crisis of 2008? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I was working here during both those huge events, seismic events. I mean [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=705.56s)]
*  the financial crisis of 2008, we saw countries going bankrupt, we saw huge investment houses [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=711.4s)]
*  like Lehman Brothers collapse and we saw governments having to bail out banks and all sorts. It [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=720.4s)]
*  was a seismic event, there was a credit crisis and it triggered a global recession. Markets [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=727.64s)]
*  were hit heavily at that time. But the intensity of the volatility then was full on but it [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=733.28s)]
*  seemed compared to say this time yesterday when I saw Germany falling by at one point [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=739.68s)]
*  nearly 10%, we didn't see that kind of intense knee-jerk reaction. And it was the same with [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=744.76s)]
*  the global pandemic, it was more of a gradual process of decline with the global pandemic [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=752.04s)]
*  as it became more clear what was going on and countries were locking down and that kind [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=757.24s)]
*  of thing. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=762.04s)]
*  And so now we're watching what, I mean some countries have said what they're going to [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=762.76s)]
*  do but not all of them. So I suppose that's going to determine what happens next and how [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=765.68s)]
*  this goes. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=769.56s)]
*  Absolutely. So today for financial markets in Europe and of course later in the United [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=770.16s)]
*  States. In the United States later when Wall Street opens it's expected they will open [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=774.76s)]
*  slightly up as well as we're seeing currently in Europe. But markets and traders will be [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=778.84s)]
*  watching every bit of news very, very closely about any negotiations going on. So for example [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=784.96s)]
*  in Japan today we saw almost a recovery in Japan on what it lost on Monday and that was [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=790.96s)]
*  on the news that the Prime Minister of Japan has been saying that he's been on the phone [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=796.6s)]
*  to President Trump and the negotiations between Japan and the US will start very, very soon [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=801.12s)]
*  on trade. So that little bit of optimism caused the main market in Japan to go up quite significantly [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  today and that's kind of what we'll be seeing. It's very sort of volatile, swift reactions [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=812.24s)]
*  to good news or bad news about what's happening with regard to trade relations. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=818.46s)]
*  Sally Barnock, thank you very much indeed for your analysis there. Thank you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5gB6jZY9tc&t=823.7s)]
