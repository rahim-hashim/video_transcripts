# Donald Trump has no plans to talk to Elon Musk, White House says | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM)
*  The very public feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk exploded on social media yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=0.0s)]
*  with both men trading insults. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Well, while a call might have been in prospect, the White House now reports that there are [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  no plans for the US president to talk to Elon Musk today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=14.22s)]
*  There had been some speculation of that, but the White House pushing back against that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=18.2s)]
*  The wider question now is what this whole rift might mean for President Trump's political [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=23.28s)]
*  future direction and indeed the global economy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=27.74s)]
*  Elon Musk has predicted a recession in the second half of this year thanks to President [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  Trump's tariffs and he's criticised one of President Trump's key domestic policies, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=34.42s)]
*  which the US president did not appreciate. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=39.62s)]
*  I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=42.339999999999996s)]
*  anybody sitting here, better than you people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  He knew everything about it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=50.62s)]
*  He had no problem with it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=51.62s)]
*  All of a sudden he had a problem. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=52.62s)]
*  Well, that was Donald Trump speaking yesterday and just minutes later Elon Musk replied on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=56.14s)]
*  X saying this was false and that the bill had never been shown to him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=60.72s)]
*  On Truth Social, President Trump then said Elon Musk was wearing thin and that he'd asked [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=65.5s)]
*  him to leave. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=69.98s)]
*  The president continued saying he'd taken away the EV mandate and that Mr Musk had gone [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=71.3s)]
*  crazy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=75.58s)]
*  Mr Musk replied calling this an obvious lie. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=76.58s)]
*  Over the course of the day, the back and forth between the two men continued. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=79.54s)]
*  Elon Musk's father has told the BBC Now that the row between his son and President Trump [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=83.86s)]
*  would fizzle out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=88.86s)]
*  Here's Errol Musk speaking to Newsday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=90.33999999999999s)]
*  What I see here is, you know, the field having been cleared of all the opposition, it's the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  bulls having their final round of seeing who's going to be the boss. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  It's a standard procedure for the last several thousand years among the leaders of countries [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  and it will fizzle out. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=115.05999999999999s)]
*  It blew up over Elon's idea that there should be no form of payment to dem lawmakers in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=118.41999999999999s)]
*  order to get their vote. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=130.38s)]
*  They should not be bribed to get the vote and so forth. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=132.42s)]
*  So unfortunately, in order to get the votes that Trump needs to get the bill through, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=136.42s)]
*  he has to have their votes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=142.82s)]
*  So Elon is standing on principle and it will fizzle out very soon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, a short time ago, I spoke to Laura Weiss, a reporter for Punchball News and Peter Morisi, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=150.42s)]
*  economist and business professor at the University of Maryland and colonist for the Washington [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=156.5s)]
*  Times. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=161.33999999999997s)]
*  I started by asking Laura if she thought this rally would blow over. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=162.38s)]
*  So I think it just underscores how quickly things can change in President Trump's orbit. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=167.26s)]
*  Elon Musk was such a central part of the administration until his departure so recently. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=172.38s)]
*  His work on Doge finding cuts and absolutely huge reductions in the federal government, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=178.4s)]
*  that's been a huge part of the narrative with the Trump administration and he's led that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=185.9s)]
*  really vocally. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=189.74s)]
*  Obviously, everything's spilled out so publicly over the last 24, 48 hours and now it absolutely [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=191.14s)]
*  could be settled, but that's yet to be seen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=198.7s)]
*  We'll kind of see how those conversations go. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=202.06s)]
*  But it was an absolutely huge kind of turn of favor, especially Republicans on Capitol [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  Hill. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=211.22s)]
*  They've grown close to Musk as well and brought him in repeatedly and so it would be an absolutely [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=212.7s)]
*  the sort of rift is a huge situation for Republicans. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=218.34s)]
*  And Peter Morisi, we saw in one of Elon Musk's posts yesterday him predicting a recession [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  and he's been critical of the tariff policy, which has had huge global impacts. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=231.02s)]
*  Well the tariffs is near as economists can calculate it, will cause the economy to slow, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=237.9s)]
*  but whether or not there'll be a recession is questionable. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=243.06s)]
*  The macroeconomic consequences of this should be to cut the expected growth in the US economy [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=246.02s)]
*  this year in half, but for it not to contract. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  Now those kinds of forecasts are iffy and Musk is going out on a limb saying things [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=256.1s)]
*  like that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=261.98s)]
*  The reality is that Musk is correct, as his father said on the principles. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=264.18s)]
*  The tax bill has a lot of pork in it, as we say here, and waste and it's ballooning the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=271.3s)]
*  deficit to the point that bond markets internationally are very worried about US finances and so [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=276.94s)]
*  forth. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=283.06s)]
*  And the tariffs really are being conducted in an irrational fashion and he's quite exasperated [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=284.06s)]
*  by what he sees. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=288.68s)]
*  But he's used to getting his way and blustering around just the way Donald Trump is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=290.5s)]
*  So you've got two big bulls, you know, behaving badly. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=294.38s)]
*  Unfortunately for Mr. Musk, Donald Trump's simply a more powerful man right now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=298.22s)]
*  And Laura, at the end of the day, that is the fact, isn't it? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=303.82000000000005s)]
*  The US president is still the US president. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  Do you think his policy on tariffs and his so-called big, beautiful bill will change [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=311.94000000000005s)]
*  in any way as a result of Musk's departure from the administration? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=318.86s)]
*  I don't think it's likely that those policies change because of Musk's criticism here or [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=323.82s)]
*  what he's kind of putting out there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=328.94s)]
*  I mean, I think the risk with Musk talking about the deficit impact of this bill, I think [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=330.46s)]
*  the bigger problem right now is you're seeing on Capitol Hill that this bill has tax cuts, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=336.41999999999996s)]
*  it has immigration policies, funding for border security, the sort of crackdowns that the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=341.7s)]
*  administration is doing, and it also has massive spending cuts to federal spending. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=346.85999999999996s)]
*  And so, you know, that's something where some of the conservative hardliners on Capitol [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=352.46s)]
*  Hill have wanted more federal spending cuts in this bill. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  If they start to get antsy with where the bill is at, that's really a bigger problem [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=360.82s)]
*  for President Trump, is he's trying to get his agenda done very quickly here, the goal [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  of getting it done by July 4th, which is coming up fast. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, I think Republicans' response, it was on Capitol Hill yesterday talking to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=372.82s)]
*  This is the agenda and this is President Trump's party. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  None of that really was changing, but I think Republicans were disappointed to see this [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=383.82s)]
*  from Musk. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=388.94s)]
*  He's become a very influential figure in Republican politics. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=389.94s)]
*  He spent a lot of money to elect Trump and Republicans in Congress, and so, you know, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=393.41999999999996s)]
*  they're not happy to see him fighting with Trump so directly, certainly. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=399.17999999999995s)]
*  But I don't think that it's going to tangibly change, for example, the bill that's working [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=403.66s)]
*  its way through Capitol Hill right now. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=408.78000000000003s)]
*  Peter, Marisi, do you agree with that? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  Because obviously, Musk also had people that he appointed within government. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=412.5s)]
*  One wonders where those people will fit in in unrolling both sort of global and domestic [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=418.54s)]
*  economic and financial directions now. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  People that he has placed into the government, they're not in locations or in positions [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=428.14000000000004s)]
*  where they'll have much influence on the things that we have been discussing, namely the contents [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=432.62s)]
*  of the tax bill, which do increase the deficit and so forth. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=437.66s)]
*  The reality is that Musk's influence is declining even before this blow up. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=441.70000000000005s)]
*  His money is only worth so much. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=449.5s)]
*  You know, if you give to a campaign, you have a lot of influence at the time you're given. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=450.94s)]
*  Once the money's spent, it's spent. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=454.82000000000005s)]
*  He has indicated that he won't be contributing as much in the future and so forth. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=458.38s)]
*  I don't expect that he's going to have much consequence on this bill and that he's going [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=462.94s)]
*  to have much influence. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=469.78s)]
*  This is kind of his swan song. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfXJeITqSM&t=470.78s)]
