Video Description: The UN has called on India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint as each side threatens the other in the wake of Tuesday's attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.
 
Indian police have named three of four suspected gunmen behind the attack that killed 26 tourists, saying two are Pakistani citizens and a third is a local Kashmiri man.
 
Pakistan denies Indian claims that it played a role in the shooting.
 
Tuesday's attack saw a group of gunmen fire on tourists near Pahalgam, a resort in the disputed Himalayan region.

# Tensions rise between India and Pakistan | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE)
*  The UN has called on India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint as each side threatens [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=0.0s)]
*  the other in the wake of Tuesday's attack in disputed Kashmir. Police say they've identified [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=6.72s)]
*  three gunmen from Pakistan who they think were responsible for the murders of 26 Indian [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  tourists. Delhi has since suspended a water sharing treaty with Pakistan and they've [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=17.48s)]
*  closed the main land border between the two countries. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=22.38s)]
*  We've got coverage from both sides. The Rana Day Mukherjee is in Delhi and Azadeh [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=26.52s)]
*  Mishiri is in Islamabad. Azadeh, there are real fears of an escalation here. You've [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  been speaking to the defence minister of Pakistan. Tell us what he said. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=35.68s)]
*  Well, the Pakistani government's position is clear. They reject any allegations that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=42.8s)]
*  Pakistan was involved in this attack. In fact, in a largely symbolic move today, the Senate [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=47.8s)]
*  passed a resolution rejecting those allegations, calling it a campaign by India, and also condemning [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=54.04s)]
*  the unilateral suspension of the water treaty. It says that that move is unlawful. Now, when [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=59.6s)]
*  we asked the Pakistani defence minister about this, he said that Pakistan could not take [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  it lying down. This treaty has been in place since 1960 and it governs the Indus River [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=73.48s)]
*  sharing system, the sharing of that water system. And it guarantees the water flow from [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=80.56s)]
*  three western rivers to Pakistan. And so we asked the defence minister how Pakistan views [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=86.08s)]
*  any move to halt or divert the flow of water from the Indus River. And this is what he [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=93.0s)]
*  said. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=99.0s)]
*  It will be a declaration of war, you know. You are actually depriving us of water, which [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=99.68s)]
*  is our right, which was acknowledged by India as it is written in that treaty. We want that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  treaty to stay alive. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=113.4s)]
*  Now, India accuses Pakistan of being indirectly involved in the attack because it accuses [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=116.4s)]
*  Pakistani militants based on Pakistani soil of being behind this attack. Now, we put this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=125.92000000000002s)]
*  to the defence minister and asked him whether he views Pakistan as having any responsibility [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=133.92s)]
*  to monitor or contain militants on its soil, especially given the history of attacks by [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=140.44s)]
*  militant groups operating in Pakistan and then also operating in India, Indian-administered [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  Kashmir. And he denied, despite US intelligence or Indian intelligence to the contrary, that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=153.92s)]
*  any of these groups operate today. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=160.96s)]
*  They are redundant and they are like... [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=164.56s)]
*  What does redundant mean? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=167.72s)]
*  Redundant means that they are inactive. They have become extinct, you know. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=168.88s)]
*  But do you therefore think that any sort of US bounties that are on anyone's heads or [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=174.36s)]
*  someone like Hafiz Sayeed, you believe that these are just outdated? Is that what you're [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=179.2s)]
*  saying? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=183.96s)]
*  They are outdated. They are outdated. They are part of the archives. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=184.48s)]
*  That the US should get rid of it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=187.16s)]
*  They are part of the archives now, you know. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=188.28s)]
*  Now the stakes are high. India and Pakistan both claim all of Kashmir and they fought [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=193.48s)]
*  two wars and a limited conflict over it. And the last time we got to a point where there [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=198.72s)]
*  were Indian airstrikes, where there was any form of back and forth military action was [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=204.84s)]
*  in 2019. At this point, the defence minister said, we're still in the realm of diplomatic [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=209.2s)]
*  tit for tat. But the possibility of that escalation is there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=214.92s)]
*  As he said, he views and Pakistan views any action when it comes to this treaty as a declaration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  of war and will be monitoring what's happening with that water flow very closely. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=226.16s)]
*  And currently, the government has told us that no third party, no country and the World [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=231.88s)]
*  Bank is not mediating this in any way right now. So what happens in the next few days [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=236.2s)]
*  and weeks could determine whether this escalates into a full blown conflict. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=240.92s)]
*  Azadeh, for the moment, thank you very much. Let's speak to Ranadeh Mukherjee in Delhi. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=246.16s)]
*  An absolute rejection there by Pakistan that they are involved in this at all, Ranadeh. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  So where is India's evidence? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=256.64s)]
*  Well, India has repeatedly over several decades has made this allegation that Pakistan has [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=259.4s)]
*  backed separatist forces which have fomented unrest in Indian administered Kashmir. And [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=266.2s)]
*  it's the same story every time. India makes those allegations and Pakistan denies it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=271.44s)]
*  But in this case, what is very significant and what makes the situation a little more [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=275.12s)]
*  unique is the scale of what we saw this time around in Indian administered Kashmir. This [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  is the first time, in a sense, in recent years that we've seen this kind of an attack take [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=284.68s)]
*  place and directed at civilians really. And that's something that has left the country [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=288.8s)]
*  shocked and also angry, which is why there is growing pressure on the Indian government, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=293.72s)]
*  especially Prime Minister Modi's party, the BJP, which leads an alliance at the government, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=300.44000000000005s)]
*  that they must appear to do something and send a very strong message. So we've heard [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=305.8s)]
*  that tough talk from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and members of his cabinet, Prime Minister [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  Modi himself saying that they will pursue the attackers till the ends of earth. What [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=314.24s)]
*  does that essentially mean? What will that translate into is what the concern really [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=318.16s)]
*  is as these two nuclear armed neighbors get into a sort of a war of words. Where does [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=322.24s)]
*  it go from here? We've seen in the past, as Azadeh was also mentioning, that in 2016, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=328.36s)]
*  there was a terror attack in Indian administered Kashmir, which India responded with what it [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=334.0s)]
*  called were surgical strikes in Pakistan administered Kashmir. In 2019, there was another terror [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  attack in Indian administered Kashmir to which India once again responded with limited strikes [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  in Pakistani territory. So when we speak to analysts, they say, look, the precedent is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  very much there if you take the past as evidence. So this time around, you have to match that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  in a sense. The government has to match that because they've already done it in the past. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=360.8s)]
*  And given the scale of what we saw this time around, what is India going to do next? That [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=363.96s)]
*  is where the concern lies. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=368.0s)]
*  Arun Nadei, thank you very much. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=369.12s)]
