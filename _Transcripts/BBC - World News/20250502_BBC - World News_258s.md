Video Description: Germany's Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has been designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution.
 
"The ethnicity- and ancestry-based understanding of the people prevailing within the party is incompatible with the free democratic order," the domestic intelligence agency said in a statement.
 
The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.
 
The parliament, or Bundestag, will hold a vote next week to confirm conservative leader Friedrich Merz as chancellor, heading a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats.
 
AfD joint leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said the decision was "clearly politically motivated" and a "severe blow to German democracy".

# Germany’s AfD party classified as extreme-right by German intelligence | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U)
*  Now to politics in Germany, where the far-right political party, the AfD, Alternative für Deutschland, has been classified as an extremist organization by the country's domestic intelligence agency. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=0.0s)]
*  The AfD made major gains in recent parliamentary elections, standing on a platform of opposing immigration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=13.0s)]
*  According to the agency, the AfD wants to exclude people from the democratic process based on their ancestry or ethnicity. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=20.0s)]
*  And this, it said, is incompatible with the German constitution. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=27.0s)]
*  The AfD has described the news as a heavy blow to democracy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=32.0s)]
*  Well, let's speak now to Clara Pfeffer, political correspondent for German outlets RTL and NTV. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=36.0s)]
*  Clara, thank you very much for joining us today to tell us more about this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=43.0s)]
*  And take us through what the intelligence agencies are saying, their reasoning for this decision. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=46.0s)]
*  Yes, thank you very much. And hello from Berlin. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=53.0s)]
*  They are basically confirming a suspicion that they've been investigating for years now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=56.0s)]
*  So the AfD has been a case of suspicion of being extremist for years. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=62.0s)]
*  And now they've compiled a paper of one thousand and one hundred pages that is saying we have it confirmed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=67.0s)]
*  We know that the AfD is not not against it is against basically the democratic principles of our German constitution, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=73.0s)]
*  specifically because it is trying to exclude entire groups, especially people with a migrational background and people who are of Muslim religion. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=82.0s)]
*  So they have found proof. And that's not everything. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=91.0s)]
*  They've also found more and more proof and put it together into that paper saying that the AfD is repeatedly using Nazi slogans. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=94.0s)]
*  That are usually not allowed in Germany. They have been saying that we should change our way of remembering the Holocaust. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=103.0s)]
*  So they've just put everything together that we've been seeing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=109.0s)]
*  And also many people have known for years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=112.0s)]
*  And you must also know that the AfD is already classified as extremist in three different states in Germany and former eastern German states. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=115.0s)]
*  So this is now basically confirming that that is the case not only for these three states, but for the entire German country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=123.0s)]
*  Interesting comments from Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He's not chancellor for very much longer, of course. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=131.0s)]
*  But he's saying the domestic intelligence agency provides very detailed justification. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=136.0s)]
*  But ban proceedings must not be rushed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=141.0s)]
*  What sort of discussion is there about a potential ban? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=145.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a highly political discussion that has been going on for years. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=149.0s)]
*  And especially in the last couple of months, it has also been discussed a lot. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=153.0s)]
*  The last government or the last Bundestag that was just reelected said that they tried to do it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=158.0s)]
*  They tried to get a majority. They failed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=166.0s)]
*  There were not enough member of parliament who were in favor of starting a ban. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=168.0s)]
*  That's also a very long process. And the discussion is basically how do we get that party smaller? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=173.0s)]
*  That's what the other political parties want to reach. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=179.0s)]
*  And they are worried that if you try it with an actual ban and that whole process, that will take years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=181.0s)]
*  Throughout those years, the AFD will have the opportunity to claim that that's being a cause that they are actually the victims, that it's not transparent, that they are being surveyed by the state. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=187.0s)]
*  So that will also be an opportunity for the AFD to maybe grow even further and mobilize. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the AFD, they are talking about legal action in response to this classification, aren't they? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=202.0s)]
*  Exactly. They are saying that they want to take legal actions. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=208.0s)]
*  They've also tried that against that case of suspicion that has been going on for years. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=211.0s)]
*  Last year, a court in Münster confirmed that they are a case of suspicion. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=215.0s)]
*  There is still some more legal action going on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=220.0s)]
*  And they will also now try to have legal actions against that classification, that confirmation of this classification, because I think that's important to understand that we've already been seeing that for years. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=222.0s)]
*  And now it's basically a confirmation of what the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, which is the institution that tries to make sure that our constitution is protected in Germany, has been seeing and surveying for years. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=233.0s)]
*  So they will take legal actions. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=245.0s)]
*  I don't know how much possibility of success there is, but obviously that delays things and the discussion will be out there for months and months to go. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=247.0s)]
*  Okay, Clara, thank you very much. Clara Pfeffer there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zV2xKUEF6U&t=255.0s)]
