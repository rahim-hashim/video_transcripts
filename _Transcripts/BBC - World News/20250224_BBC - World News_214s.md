# What do UK’s further sanctions mean for Russia? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ)
*  So the British Prime Minister hit in Russia with a fresh round of sanctions from the UK [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  three years after the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=5.68s)]
*  So what will they actually mean in practice? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=7.88s)]
*  Ben Chu from BBC Verify has more. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Foreign Secretary David Lammy is announcing a new package of sanctions on Russia. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=14.88s)]
*  And they include sanctions on firms importing machine tools to Russia that can also be used [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=20.12s)]
*  by its military and some new sanctions on North Korean generals who've been involved [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=26.04s)]
*  in sending troops into Ukraine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=30.84s)]
*  The European Union has also announced its own new sanctions today and they include a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=33.24s)]
*  clamp down on a so-called shadow fleet which has been used to illicitly sell Russian oil [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=37.4s)]
*  to the West and new export restrictions on video game controllers used to pilot Russian [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=42.44s)]
*  drones on the battlefield. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=47.56s)]
*  But let's take a step back and look at what sanctions were already in place. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=49.76s)]
*  In January there were more than 2,000 individuals and companies subject to UK sanctions in relation [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  to the Russian invasion. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=60.5s)]
*  Around 2,300 were subject to EU sanctions and the US had also sanctioned more than 5,800. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  That all makes Russia the world's most sanctioned state. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=69.12s)]
*  But how effective have these sanctions been and will the new ones make much difference? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=73.16s)]
*  It's important to recognise that there are two purposes for the sanctions. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=78.92s)]
*  One to put pressure on Putin and individuals in the regime which are close to him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=82.68s)]
*  Second to impede Russia's ability to wage war in Ukraine and also to damage the wider [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=87.2s)]
*  Russian economy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=92.56s)]
*  On the first front there has clearly been an impact on the ability of Russian oligarchs [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=94.56s)]
*  identified by the UK government and the EU as close to Putin like Roman Abramovich to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  travel to Western capitals and many of their assets in the West such as houses have been [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  frozen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  As for the wider Russian economy the reality is that it's weathered the unprecedented [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=110.96s)]
*  barrage of Western sanctions in 2022 better than initially expected. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  This dotted red line shows what the International Monetary Fund forecast would happen to Russian [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=120.3s)]
*  economic growth in April 2022 just after the initial sanctions were announced. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=124.82s)]
*  The forecast suggested the country would slump into a deep recession but this dark blue line [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=130.04s)]
*  shows what actually happened. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=136.44s)]
*  It avoided that slump and was forecast to keep growing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  That's partly because Russia has been able to continue to source consumer goods and some [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  vital industrial components from China and it's worth noting that the Western sanctions [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  were never intended to be complete when it came to Russian energy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=154.12s)]
*  They wanted to reduce the revenues flowing to the Kremlin for its oil through a price [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=158.24s)]
*  not to cut off those flows completely because Western leaders were worried about the impact [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=162.72s)]
*  of that on prices in their own countries. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  However some analysts say there are signs that the Russian economy is now coming under [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=171.76s)]
*  severe strain and that it's best encapsulated by this which shows the interest rates set [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  by the Russian central bank. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=181.76s)]
*  Russia has had to devote a considerable share of its national economic resources to producing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=183.92s)]
*  weapons and paying soldiers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=188.42s)]
*  That's created some serious domestic inflationary pressures. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=190.52s)]
*  That's why the central bank has had to put interest rates up to 21%. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=193.96s)]
*  Some economists doubt that this is sustainable for Russia. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=199.06s)]
*  Nevertheless it's hard to be certain how much of this economic pressure on Russia is specifically [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  due to Western sanctions and how much to the general strain of Putin's shift of the Russian [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  economy onto a war footing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mh2MjlzhVQ&t=212.62s)]
