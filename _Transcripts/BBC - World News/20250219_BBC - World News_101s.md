Video Description: Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.

A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.

They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.

Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.
