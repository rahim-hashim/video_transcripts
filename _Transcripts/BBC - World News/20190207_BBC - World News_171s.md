# A bus ride through crisis-hit Caracas - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU)
*  My daughter is leaving me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=0.0s)]
*  But I'm still here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=5.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=22.0s)]
*  How is life in Caracas today? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=24.0s)]
*  A glistening. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=26.0s)]
*  In general, for everything. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=28.0s)]
*  Here we don't have transport, we don't have food, we don't have electricity, we don't have gas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=34.0s)]
*  In your house there is no gas? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=39.0s)]
*  I have two months without gas in the house. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=42.0s)]
*  Normally I take two hours from my house to get to my work here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=45.0s)]
*  So four hours in a day? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=49.0s)]
*  Yes, sometimes to go and come. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=51.0s)]
*  Many people leave Venezuela saying, enough, but you stay. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=53.0s)]
*  I love my country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=57.0s)]
*  My daughter is leaving me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=66.0s)]
*  But I'm still here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=71.0s)]
*  You're leaving? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=74.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=76.0s)]
*  Where? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=77.0s)]
*  Colombia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=78.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=79.0s)]
*  Because it's very difficult to keep the family right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=80.0s)]
*  Because my mother can't, I can't see my mother suffering. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=84.0s)]
*  We can't get a job. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=88.0s)]
*  And a minimum wage is not enough for anything. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=90.0s)]
*  Neither because I earn it, nor because we earn a minimum wage. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=93.0s)]
*  It's not enough. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=96.0s)]
*  What are you going to do today? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=100.0s)]
*  I'm going to be employed by the situation in the country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=102.0s)]
*  I'll get enough food, meat, eggs, bread, flour. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=104.0s)]
*  The common thing is that there's no food. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=109.0s)]
*  And the government manages it to its own convenience. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=111.0s)]
*  How is it to live in Caracas? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=119.0s)]
*  Terrible. It's like a war. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=121.0s)]
*  A war? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=123.0s)]
*  In what terms? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=124.0s)]
*  In everything. Lack of security, insecurity, bad government. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=125.0s)]
*  In what job do you do? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=129.0s)]
*  I'm a lawyer. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=131.0s)]
*  But you stay in Venezuela? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=132.0s)]
*  No, I'm leaving too. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=134.0s)]
*  Where? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=135.0s)]
*  To Spain. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=136.0s)]
*  Spain? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=137.0s)]
*  I'm telling you to be careful with the equipment on the street. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=138.0s)]
*  Are there problems with the bus? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=146.0s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=148.0s)]
*  I get stuck. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=149.0s)]
*  In the 12 years I've been working, I've been stuck several times. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=152.0s)]
*  Look, the lamp even took the music. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=159.0s)]
*  Let's go with the music. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=161.0s)]
*  The lamp took it to... [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=164.0s)]
*  to Spain. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJy25rsXBU&t=168.0s)]
