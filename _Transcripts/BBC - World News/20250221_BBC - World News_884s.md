# Who is flooding West Africa with opioids? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU)
*  Illegal addictive opioids are flooding the streets of West Africa, destroying thousands [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=0.0s)]
*  of lives and fueling a public health crisis. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=7.2s)]
*  It's happening in Côte d'Ivoire, in Ghana, in Nigeria. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=10.68s)]
*  But where are these pills coming from? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=16.8s)]
*  Five million tablet. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=19.12s)]
*  How are they getting into West Africa? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=20.64s)]
*  I think this is wickedness. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=22.8s)]
*  And who are the people making a killing from them? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=25.0s)]
*  These are very unput out of it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=28.2s)]
*  But now they're this way of doing it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=30.2s)]
*  I'm on my way to the Nigerian Drugs Enforcement Agency, the NDLEA. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=41.92s)]
*  Their checkpoints have become a common sight on the streets of Lagos. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=46.84s)]
*  In 2023, they seized opioids worth more than a hundred million US dollars. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=51.6s)]
*  This here, all this is 225 tramadol. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=57.96s)]
*  Which is illegal? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=62.96s)]
*  Which is illegal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=63.8s)]
*  Tramadol is a catch-all name to describe the range of opioids used as street drugs. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  It's estimated more than four million people in Nigeria are misusing some form of opioid. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=70.56s)]
*  We're having a problem coming in from another country that has become a big menace in Nigeria. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=76.88s)]
*  And which country is that? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=82.44s)]
*  India. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=83.88s)]
*  In 2018, the government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  and cracked down on the import of illegal opioids. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=90.48s)]
*  Since then, more and more are being smuggled across the borders. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  These shipments came in through Ghana, through the borders. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=98.52s)]
*  They have been tracking him for five months. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=102.08s)]
*  Would you say that the route between Ghana and Nigeria is becoming more popular in the last year or so? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=112.76s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=113.8s)]
*  Tamale in northern Ghana has been hit hard by a recent rise in opioid use. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=116.92s)]
*  Journalist Yahya Masahudu grew up here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=122.72s)]
*  These drugs are destroying families, destroying young men and women with potential [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=126.48s)]
*  who otherwise would have been able to help in developing this country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=133.68s)]
*  It's got so bad, locals have set up their own task force to track down the opioid dealers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=141.12s)]
*  I'm Siky. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=148.52s)]
*  And this is Chairman Jamal, Operation Leader. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=150.12s)]
*  A tip-off has led them to one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Tamale. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=157.12s)]
*  They'll be raiding the place to see if they can get some of the drugs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=161.12s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=171.12s)]
*  What is happening right now is the task force is here to arrest the drug dealers. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=172.12s)]
*  It's an addict who has taken the drugs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=182.12s)]
*  This is what they found here with just one day. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=194.12s)]
*  This is what happens almost on a daily basis. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=198.12s)]
*  These opioids are highly addictive. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=229.12s)]
*  Some take them as painkillers or to help them get through hard physical work. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=233.12s)]
*  But many use them simply to get high. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=238.12s)]
*  They can cause breathing problems and seizures. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=241.12s)]
*  Overdosing can kill. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=244.12s)]
*  The main idea behind the interrogation is to get to find out who the suppliers are. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=247.12s)]
*  The chief adjudicates the matter and someone is found guilty. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=253.12s)]
*  The person is fined some amount of money. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=257.12s)]
*  The man in yellow is just a small-time dealer. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=275.12s)]
*  But who is at the top of this chain? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=278.12s)]
*  These packets are all we have to go on. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=281.12s)]
*  But they do offer some clues. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=284.12s)]
*  Hi, Swarmi. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=287.12s)]
*  Hi, Ayah. Good to see you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=288.12s)]
*  Did you get the photos I sent you from the raid the task force did the other day? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=290.12s)]
*  Yeah, I have them pulled up on my computer now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=295.12s)]
*  The product is called Tafrodol. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=298.12s)]
*  The Ghanaian FDA have confirmed to me the product is illegal in Ghana. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=301.12s)]
*  Then I can also see that it says made in India. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=307.12s)]
*  And if I zoom into the corner, there's a logo with an A and a leaf. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=312.12s)]
*  It's important to look into that and to find out who is responsible for bringing the product into West Africa. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=318.12s)]
*  The task force is trying to catch the traders and smugglers. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=326.12s)]
*  But it's the source that needs to be stopped. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=331.12s)]
*  So let me start there and I'll get back to you when I have more information. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=334.12s)]
*  We know the drugs are made in India. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=340.12s)]
*  Now we need to find out who is making them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=343.12s)]
*  When I put Tafrodol into a search engine, the top results show that the brand name Tafrodol is registered to a company called Aveo Pharmaceuticals. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=351.12s)]
*  When I look for Aveo Pharmaceuticals, their official website shows up, which actually details their products and manufacturing practices. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=363.12s)]
*  It looks like a legitimate company, but it's the logo that really catches my attention. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=379.12s)]
*  I found teenagers in Cote d'Ivoire are mixing Tafrodol with an alcoholic drink called Vodine. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=384.12s)]
*  And there it is, the same logo. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=391.12s)]
*  Aveo Pharmaceuticals. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=396.12s)]
*  It's not just Cote d'Ivoire. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=399.12s)]
*  Even in Ghana, I found reports of Tafrodol being seized by the police. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=401.12s)]
*  When I zoom in, there is an A, which looks like the A from Aveo. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=407.12s)]
*  In the same seizure is another product, T-marking. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=415.12s)]
*  In the corner of that box, the same logo, Aveo Pharmaceuticals. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=420.12s)]
*  We also send out researchers in Nigeria to see if they could find products with the Aveo logo. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=425.12s)]
*  And sure enough, they came back to us with Tafrodol XX. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=433.12s)]
*  We know the name of the company. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=438.12s)]
*  Now we need to find the people at the top. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=440.12s)]
*  An undercover operative agreed to go to Aveo's factory, posing as a businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=445.12s)]
*  We're here to see Mr. Shabnam. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=454.12s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Shabnam. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=456.12s)]
*  This is one of the directors of Aveo and the boss of this factory, Vinod Sharma. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=457.12s)]
*  He takes them on a tour of the factory. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=464.12s)]
*  Came across this huge businessman. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=469.12s)]
*  We're looking here and trying to find the people who are responsible for the operation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=473.12s)]
*  Came across this huge businessman. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=480.12s)]
*  He actually showed us that the factory is certified by the World Health Organization. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=487.12s)]
*  That cemented the impression of the world-class standard. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=494.12s)]
*  This is the farm, sir? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=501.12s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=503.12s)]
*  What? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=504.12s)]
*  They are doing massive operations. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=506.12s)]
*  They are on 5 million tablets. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=508.12s)]
*  Back at Sharma's office, it's time to talk business. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=512.12s)]
*  This is a sample of a patterned capsule tablet. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=516.12s)]
*  Everything is perfect. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=519.12s)]
*  The packet of Tafrodol is instantly recognisable. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=524.12s)]
*  It's the same brand found on the streets in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=527.12s)]
*  Tafrodol is stronger than Tafrodol. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=533.12s)]
*  This is super royal. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=536.12s)]
*  It looks just like the drugs found in Lagos. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=538.12s)]
*  This is Tima King, the same product seized by the Ghanaian police in 2024. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=543.12s)]
*  Vinod Sharma displays many more products that look remarkably similar to those found by authorities across West Africa. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=550.12s)]
*  This is a very powerful capsule. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=559.12s)]
*  Tablets are very powerful compared to the capsule. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=560.12s)]
*  But the rate is very different. Double rate. Double power. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=563.12s)]
*  To me, about how they came up with the opioids that they make as a reaction to government-cannabinoid trauma drug, which they used to also make. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=567.12s)]
*  You also need to have an understanding of the global shipping business and the logistics of the operation. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=576.12s)]
*  Buyer is not possible nowadays because government is looking very clearly. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=584.12s)]
*  And you can supply by the sea. But only the North Lagos, Ghana and other. Otherwise, it can arrest, capture the container. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=589.12s)]
*  Clearly, he knew that what he was producing was legal. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=600.12s)]
*  But the fact that he was willing to talk about producing the opioids for me, branding the opioids for me, and shipping the opioids to West Africa for me. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=603.12s)]
*  All of that spoke to a businessman who was willing to take a lot of risk. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=616.12s)]
*  I can hear from our customers in this area. You can hear from your side. Every client is working like this. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=622.12s)]
*  Sharma doesn't flinch when the team tells him who they're planning to sell the opioids to. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=631.12s)]
*  Do you have a local market in Nigeria? Where can you supply these materials? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=637.12s)]
*  So we do. And our plan is to sell to young people. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=642.12s)]
*  I've seen something else. We find out there are a whole lot of products. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=647.12s)]
*  And they can be sold on their own. The product is affordable. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=652.12s)]
*  I was really pleased to try it out in the market. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=656.12s)]
*  This item is a pain killer. But suppose you can use two or three tablets at the same time, you can like this. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=660.12s)]
*  This is what the kid wants. That's what he likes. He wants it to be high. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=668.12s)]
*  High. High. High. This is very harmful for the health. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=672.12s)]
*  Very harmful? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=676.12s)]
*  But the customer cannot understand. He wants it to be high. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=678.12s)]
*  He wants it to be high. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=683.12s)]
*  Any medicine can be huge. This is very harmful for the body. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=685.12s)]
*  But now this is a business. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=693.12s)]
*  Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=699.12s)]
*  Finally, I was face to face, not with some local dealer or transnational smuggler, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=705.12s)]
*  but actually one of the men at the root of Africa's opioid crisis. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=711.12s)]
*  The team market is slowly floating. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=716.12s)]
*  One of the men who actually makes this opioid and ships it into our countries by container load [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=719.12s)]
*  is depressed and watching someone who produces this opioid, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=726.12s)]
*  speaking about it and describing it as a business. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=730.12s)]
*  In India, any drug made only for export must comply with the requirements of the importing country. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=733.12s)]
*  Ghana's drug authorities told us this product doesn't meet their import requirements. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=741.12s)]
*  By shipping taffydol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=747.12s)]
*  Now we know who's making the drug, but how is it getting into Ghana? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=757.12s)]
*  Oh, listen, you can see Samo's Pharma written. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=763.12s)]
*  We found evidence that a company in the capital Accra has handled millions of the pills. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=768.12s)]
*  I'm not very sure that these guys are going to be friendly and whether they will allow us to firm. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=774.12s)]
*  This is the evidence that led us to Samo's Pharma. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=780.12s)]
*  Export data showing that Samo's has imported millions of opioid bills from India [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=784.12s)]
*  through Ghanaian ports by a company called Westphine International. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=791.12s)]
*  Looking into Westphine, we found the board of directors, among them a familiar name, Vinod Sharma. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=796.12s)]
*  In Tamale, it's left for groups like the Citizens Task Force to tackle the opioid crisis. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=806.12s)]
*  More of Vinod Sharma's taffydol. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=816.12s)]
*  That evening, they gather in a local park to burn the drugs. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=821.12s)]
*  This task force, in one small corner of the city, is working on a new drug. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=827.12s)]
*  This task force, in one small corner of West Africa, is doing all they can. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=833.12s)]
*  But as these drugs burn, production lines in India are churning out millions more. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=838.12s)]
*  And the people who make them are getting rich on the profits of other people's misery. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=845.12s)]
*  Music [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HxBk6_IqdU&t=863.12s)]
