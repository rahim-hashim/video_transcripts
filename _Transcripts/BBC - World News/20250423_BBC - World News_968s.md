Video Description: Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes, shifts in social attitudes and in large part driven by social media.
 
Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures.
 
Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25.
 
For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face.
 
But lately, more disturbing procedures are on the rise - chasing an unrealistic, hyper-feminine, almost infantile ideal.
 
Details of help and support with body image concerns are available in the UK at BBC Action Line.

# Inside China's cosmetic surgery boom | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA)
*  In China, over 80% of those having cosmetic procedures are women, and the average age is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=0.0s)]
*  25. So Young Beauty app portrays cosmetic surgery as a fulfilling experience in the advert. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=27.52s)]
*  But toxic beauty videos flood social media, and some young women are even being scammed into surgery. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=38.56s)]
*  We investigate China's most notorious case of botched surgery. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=57.52s)]
*  And track down the surgeon responsible. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=63.6s)]
*  Every year, more than 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=88.52s)]
*  But according to industry research, hundreds of medical accidents are happening every day. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=94.52s)]
*  In China, over 80% of those having cosmetic procedures are women, and the average age is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=117.52s)]
*  25. So Young Beauty app portrays cosmetic surgery as a fulfilling experience in the advert. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=124.52s)]
*  After a week, the tissue at the tip of her nose died. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=147.52s)]
*  And specialists told Gao Liu her nose might be beyond saving. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=175.52s)]
*  There was public outrage, and a call for the authorities to act. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=184.52s)]
*  The Guangzhou Health Commission soon responded. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=200.52s)]
*  Xi's times closed within months of the scandal. But Gao Liu's surgeon He Ming was never named in the report. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=223.52s)]
*  But is this rumor true? Is Dr. He still operating? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=238.52s)]
*  China's cosmetic surgery industry has grown five-fold in the last 10 years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=248.52s)]
*  Beauty influencers like Abbie Wu, with more than half a million followers, have helped to normalise the practice. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=262.52s)]
*  China's cosmetic surgery industry is also fuelled by hugely popular beauty apps. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=286.52s)]
*  They feature photo filters that create an idealised look. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=293.52s)]
*  The most popular app is So Young. Simply scan your face and let the app analyse your so-called imperfections. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=300.52s)]
*  And then it recommends procedures. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=312.52s)]
*  So Young connects potential patients with clinics and doctors from more than 300 Chinese cities. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=336.52s)]
*  Dr Yang Lu is a cosmetic surgeon with 20 years' experience. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=366.52s)]
*  The surge in demand for cosmetic procedures has led to a shortage of qualified surgeons like Dr Yang Lu and more botched surgery. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=381.52s)]
*  We asked Dr Yang Lu for her professional opinion on Gao Liu's botched surgery. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=396.52s)]
*  We've been investigating Dr He Ming's career. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=426.52s)]
*  On a national database, we found that Dr He Ming only became a licensed plastic surgeon in April 2024, three and a half years after operating on Gao Liu's nose. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=455.52s)]
*  But even then, this licence should not have been granted to him. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=468.52s)]
*  Provincial Health Commission rules state that no surgeon who's been sanctioned in the last five years can qualify. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=473.52s)]
*  Dr He was sanctioned in 2021. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=481.52s)]
*  But on social media, we found recent videos of him operating at another clinic called Qingya. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=485.52s)]
*  To find out whether he's really operating as a licensed plastic surgeon, we go undercover. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=495.52s)]
*  We've managed to get a consultation with Dr He. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=503.52s)]
*  The staff say Dr He Ming is in theatre, so we're sent to talk with a senior beauty consultant. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=513.52s)]
*  She's keen to sell the same nose job Gao Liu had, and shows us photos of Dr He Ming's work from the period in which we know he wasn't qualified. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=526.52s)]
*  By the end of the meeting, we've been offered surgery amounting to more than US$10,000, and a loan to help cover the cost. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=556.52s)]
*  We're told Dr He will meet us soon. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=565.52s)]
*  In 2017, local government passed a development plan for Chengdu to become the country's capital of cosmetic surgery. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=576.52s)]
*  But it seems that a new scam is on the rise in some cosmetic surgery clinics here. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=585.52s)]
*  Dalan, not her real name, says she was pressured into a loan and surgery just 24 hours after being offered a job. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=594.52s)]
*  She's been working at a clinic for over a year now. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=624.52s)]
*  She's been working at a clinic for over a year now. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=634.52s)]
*  After surgery, there were other problems. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=644.52s)]
*  I don't know why she's not satisfied. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=674.52s)]
*  She would yell at you on the stage. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=676.52s)]
*  I said, I want to quit. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=680.52s)]
*  I remember they had planned to make me quit earlier. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=683.52s)]
*  I actually had heard that I would be out for more than 10 days, and then they only gave me US$303. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=687.52s)]
*  And I had a leave of absence. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=693.52s)]
*  I wanted to get some fresh air. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=700.52s)]
*  When I called the police, they said I had seen a lot of things like that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=702.52s)]
*  Dalan says the clinic which scammed her is still recruiting for the same role. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=710.52s)]
*  Gao Liu is in Thailand on holiday. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=724.52s)]
*  I sometimes forget to press the button to stop the pressure on my nose. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=733.52s)]
*  Sometimes I can't sleep when I think about it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=738.52s)]
*  I've been working at a clinic for over a year now. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=744.52s)]
*  I've been working at a clinic for over a year now. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=750.52s)]
*  I've never apologized to her. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=758.52s)]
*  I didn't say it was her fault. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=766.52s)]
*  Back at the clinic, we finally meet Dr. Herming. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=774.52s)]
*  You want to know more about your nose? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=778.52s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=780.52s)]
*  Let me see your eye patch. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=783.52s)]
*  It's too hard to use. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=787.52s)]
*  I'll change it to a more oil-based one. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=790.52s)]
*  How long have you been doing this surgery? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=793.52s)]
*  I've been doing it since 2012. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=796.52s)]
*  Oh, since 2012. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=800.52s)]
*  He's making himself sound very experienced. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=801.52s)]
*  But Dr. He isn't really a properly qualified plastic surgeon. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=807.52s)]
*  Let me see your eye patch. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=813.52s)]
*  And with that, he's off. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=816.52s)]
*  It looks like Dr. He's surgical career is unaffected by Gao Liu's ordeal. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=820.52s)]
*  I want to show you a video. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=831.52s)]
*  Hello, Dr. He. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=836.52s)]
*  Let me see your eye patch. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=839.52s)]
*  How long will it take to recover? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=844.52s)]
*  If he has a surgery, it'll probably be two years. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=846.52s)]
*  Yes, that's him. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=850.52s)]
*  The video I showed you was the one I had with my colleague. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=852.52s)]
*  I haven't talked to him for a long time. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=858.52s)]
*  Many people don't understand anything like I did. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=861.52s)]
*  They think this doctor is very good, so they do it blindly. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=865.52s)]
*  Last year, the Guangdong Medical Association recorded the most records of doctors in the Guangdong province. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=869.52s)]
*  So they were called the Guangzhou Nose King. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=877.52s)]
*  After many years, I think it's pretty ironic that people call me the Guangzhou Nose King. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=880.52s)]
*  It's funny that I have a good nose and my nose is so bad. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=885.52s)]
*  There are scars on my teeth. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=899.52s)]
*  It's better to get a surgery naturally. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=901.52s)]
*  I didn't know much about it before. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=907.52s)]
*  Actually, the projects I do are all about making a mess. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=916.52s)]
*  If I were to go back to the past, I would think I wouldn't have gotten any surgery. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=925.52s)]
*  Thank you for watching. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyLbhv4SOeA&t=945.52s)]
