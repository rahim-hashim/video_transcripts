*  We start with the continuing turmoil in the financial markets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=0.0s)]

*  And the index in Paris down nearly 6% in early trading. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  President Trump's tariffs are continuing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  to send shockwaves and fuel fears of a recession. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Now, stock markets across Asia have seen an absolute sea of red [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=24.52s)]
*  at one point in early trading. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=28.88s)]
*  The main market in Japan, the Nikkei, was down by nearly 9%. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=30.2s)]
*  The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is currently down more than 13%. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=34.48s)]
*  And the markets in South Korea and Taiwan [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=39.16s)]
*  have also fallen sharply into negative territory. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=41.56s)]
*  In China, investors have warned people [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=44.72s)]
*  to brace themselves for what they're calling Ugly Monday. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  President Trump, for now, is ignoring the turmoil [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=51.0s)]
*  on the stock market. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  Speaking on Air Force One, he said, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=54.28s)]
*  sometimes you have to take medicine to fix the problem. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=55.96s)]
*  He insisted that jobs and investments [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=59.56s)]
*  were returning to the US. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=62.28s)]
*  Now, what's going to happen with the market, I can't tell you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=65.48s)]
*  But I can tell you, our country has gotten a lot stronger. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=67.8s)]
*  And eventually, it'll be a country like no other. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  It'll be the most dominant country [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=75.6s)]
*  economically in the world, which is what it should be. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  Is there a Trump put, though? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=80.84s)]
*  Is there a pain in the market? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=82.56s)]
*  At some point, you're unwilling to tolerate this idea of a Trump [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=85.52s)]
*  put. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=88.48s)]
*  Is there a threshold? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  I think your question is so stupid. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't want anything to go down. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=94.08s)]
*  But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=96.16s)]
*  And we have such a horrible, we have been treated so badly [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=99.2s)]
*  by other countries because we had stupid leadership that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=105.64s)]
*  allowed this to happen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, Marika Oyen, our Asia Business Hub [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  has the latest from there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=113.04s)]
*  It has been described by some analysts [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  as even a financial bloodbath, as all we've been seeing all day [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=117.72s)]
*  was a sea of red arrows pointing downwards. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=122.48s)]
*  As you said, Japan's Nikkei has finished trading for the day [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  down 7%. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=128.56s)]
*  And it goes to show how this is a deeper sell-off than what [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  we saw on Thursday and Friday. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=133.28s)]
*  And that's because investors are growing increasingly concerned [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=135.68s)]
*  about the escalating global trade war [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=138.88s)]
*  and also the impact on the global economy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=141.36s)]
*  Because of course, it was on Friday evening, our time, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=143.6s)]
*  Asia time, when Beijing retaliated [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=146.4s)]
*  with that 34% tariffs on all American products [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=148.88s)]
*  entering China, which really escalated [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=152.36s)]
*  that fear of global trade war. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=155.12s)]
*  In terms of the impact on the global economy, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  I think we've been hearing from a lot of economists talking [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=160.28s)]
*  about these tariffs pushing up prices in the United States [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=163.2s)]
*  and pushing the US economy into a recession. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=166.84s)]
*  But some are even worried that the global economy could [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=169.04s)]
*  fall into a recession as well. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=171.72s)]
*  And of course, the impact on the global supply chain [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=173.68s)]
*  as we've been talking about it, that's something [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=176.32s)]
*  that they're worried about too. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=178.28s)]
*  Mariko Ooi there, well, let's talk to our business presenter, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=180.16s)]
*  Sally Bundock. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=182.8s)]
*  Sally, just give us an overview how bad things are. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=183.8s)]
*  Pretty bad. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=186.96s)]
*  As you were hearing from Mariko there, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=187.8s)]
*  and I mean you outlined just how dramatic the open has [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=189.44s)]
*  been in Europe this morning. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=192.04s)]
*  It's not overstating it to say it's carnage [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=194.56s)]
*  or a bloodbath or any of those adjectives [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=196.8s)]
*  to describe how today is progressing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  And actually, the bookies or the futures markets [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=202.28s)]
*  are predicting we'll see a dramatic decline again today [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=205.44s)]
*  on Wall Street. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  And what's fed into this is, of course, Trump's tariffs. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=209.8s)]
*  That's the reason for the massive sell-off. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=214.12s)]
*  I think his defiance that we saw there on Air Force One [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=216.96s)]
*  as he was setting off or landing or whichever way he was going [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  is really being read in markets as he's staying put, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=224.44s)]
*  he's hanging tough, whatever phrases he's using. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=228.12s)]
*  He's not reacting to markets. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=230.68s)]
*  Therefore, many investors now are pricing in. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=232.96s)]
*  This could be a long, hard battle. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=236.0s)]
*  And the impact that will have on economies around the world, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=239.44s)]
*  the global economy, is not going to be good. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=242.16s)]
*  And actually, some are pricing in recession. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=244.04s)]
*  Goldman Sachs today increased the chances of a US recession [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=246.36s)]
*  to 45% this year. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=251.44s)]
*  Everyone is readjusting all their outlook now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  And they're pricing in bad stuff, basically. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=257.76s)]
*  When we hear about share prices tumbling, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  how does that translate into an economic recession, real life [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=264.28s)]
*  effects that people will feel? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=270.24s)]
*  Well, when it comes to how we might feel the impact right now, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=271.24s)]
*  I mean, for people who are trading markets on a daily [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=274.8s)]
*  basis, they're speculators. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=277.8s)]
*  There's lots of people who do that at home. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  They're sitting in front of a terminal [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=280.44s)]
*  and they're trying to make money. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=281.52s)]
*  For them, it's really tough because they're either [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=282.88s)]
*  going to lose a lot or they might win a lot, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=284.84s)]
*  depending on how good they are. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  For those of us who have pensions, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  so I'm not trading shares on a daily basis, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=290.56s)]
*  but I do have a pension that I will one day be making use of. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  That's been hit today. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=297.52s)]
*  So most pensions globally will have gone down [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  in terms of their paper value. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  But of course, the good news about that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=305.55999999999995s)]
*  is I'm not retiring anytime soon. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  And so therefore, by the time I do retire, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=310.2s)]
*  the hope is that markets will have recovered significantly. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=312.32s)]
*  And that's why those who manage people's money, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=316.52s)]
*  personal finance investment advisors, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=321.76s)]
*  always say you invest for the long term. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=324.4s)]
*  And by that, you mean a long time, one year, five years, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=327.44s)]
*  10 years, or more. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=331.12s)]
*  Because there are stock market, lots of volatility [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=332.64s)]
*  on stock markets. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=339.12s)]
*  And in my career, I've seen massive sell-offs previously [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=340.4s)]
*  when the 2008 financial crisis happened, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=343.52s)]
*  when the global pandemic happened. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  Markets fell off a cliff, but they come back again. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's the point. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=352.2s)]
*  Yeah, they sure do. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=353.28s)]
*  Sally, we're just looking at pictures from Luxembourg [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  because EU ministers responsible for trade [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=356.56s)]
*  are arriving there currently. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=360.44s)]
*  They're going to talk to the media, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  we think, about how the European Union should best respond [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=363.56s)]
*  to this series of tariffs, as well as a decision on EU [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=366.88s)]
*  relations with China. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=371.44s)]
*  But that is a problem for so many countries [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=372.32s)]
*  to decide what to do now, whether to retaliate or not to, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=374.44s)]
*  and hope that perhaps you can negotiate something better. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=377.2s)]
*  And time is of the essence, because we [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=379.56s)]
*  saw the blanket 10% tariffs come in over the weekend. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=381.92s)]
*  But those more specific retaliatory tariffs [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=386.56s)]
*  on the part of the US begin on Wednesday. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  So between now and Wednesday, the European Union, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=392.2s)]
*  European Commission have got the chance [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=395.8s)]
*  to negotiate with President Trump, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=398.24s)]
*  because of course he said he called Europe [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  one of the worst offenders. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=401.68s)]
*  They're on the bad list. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=403.12s)]
*  And the tariffs on all European goods is sitting at 20%, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  which is huge for some industries, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=408.24s)]
*  like the champagne industry, the wine sector, cosmetics. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=410.48s)]
*  Cars is 25%. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  And actually, if you look on the stock markets today [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=416.4s)]
*  and you look at some of the biggest losers, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=418.32s)]
*  it's VW, it's Mercedes, Persia Citroen, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=420.32s)]
*  those kind of companies. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=423.24s)]
*  So for the trade ministers meeting now in Luxembourg, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=424.76s)]
*  they're going to be talking about that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=427.56s)]
*  What is the best course of action? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=428.84s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=431.28s)]
*  has been very forthright, very strong, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=433.56s)]
*  talking about a united front in Europe [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=436.56s)]
*  and how we will come back with our tariffs as well. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=438.52s)]
*  She talked about 26 billion euros worth of tariffs [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  on American goods coming into Europe, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  which will hit US hard. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=446.84s)]
*  But that's not been confirmed yet, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=448.52s)]
*  because of course they want to negotiate. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=450.76s)]
*  They want to try and get a deal before Wednesday. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=452.68s)]
*  How great is this secondary fear that these tariffs [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=455.08s)]
*  will end up with cheaper goods going elsewhere, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=458.56s)]
*  sort of being dumped on other countries [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=462.52s)]
*  that don't have tariffs? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=464.36s)]
*  Absolutely, it's a huge fear, because China, for example, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=465.2s)]
*  if we just give an example of that, BYD, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=468.8s)]
*  massive electric vehicle maker in China, they're cheap. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=471.4s)]
*  They can make them really cheaply in China [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=475.52s)]
*  and then export them all over the world. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=478.04s)]
*  And that's one of the things that President Trump [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=479.48s)]
*  is not happy about whatsoever. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=481.6s)]
*  So if far fewer BYD cars are being sold [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=484.04s)]
*  in the United States, well, where are they all going to go? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=487.88s)]
*  They might end up here in Europe. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, of course, we've put tariffs on Chinese cars [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  actually anyway here in Europe. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=493.6s)]
*  But the point is with steel, with other products [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  that are being heavily tariffed going into the States, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=500.04s)]
*  if they're channeled elsewhere, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=504.72s)]
*  then it could end up here in the UK, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  dumped on our markets or on European markets [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=510.12s)]
*  or other markets. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=512.1999999999999s)]
*  And then it makes it really difficult to compete with that, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=513.48s)]
*  like British Steel, for example. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=516.04s)]
*  So that's a real issue. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=517.8s)]
*  And that's something that the Prime Minister has implied. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=518.92s)]
*  We're waiting to hear, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=521.76s)]
*  he's going to deliver a speech later today [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=522.6s)]
*  about ways that the UK government can try [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=524.48s)]
*  and cushion the blow for UK industry. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=527.16s)]
*  But it's expected there'll be some sort of discussion [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=529.88s)]
*  about anti-dumping measures, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=532.6s)]
*  measures put in place to stop that from happening. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=535.24s)]
*  Sally, you've been speaking to a lot of different analysts [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=538.48s)]
*  over the last few hours. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=541.16s)]
*  The consensus on tariffs per se, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=542.64s)]
*  they're not always a bad thing, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=545.16s)]
*  but what is the consensus really about [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  what's happened this time is that it is such a blanket [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=549.52s)]
*  application of tariffs. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=552.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the difference is, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=553.44s)]
*  something that President Trump has said quite a few times [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=555.2s)]
*  is he refers back to the 1930s or whatever, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=557.96s)]
*  when this was massively introduced on a huge level before, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=560.84s)]
*  seen as a big protectionist policy [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=564.84s)]
*  that led to economic growth in the US eventually. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=567.52s)]
*  The difference though then compared to now [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  is the globalisation of industry, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=574.76s)]
*  of business, of commerce, in the recent decades, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=579.48s)]
*  because of course it's all been about world trade, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=583.76s)]
*  it's all been about where is it most efficient to do things [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=585.88s)]
*  and make things and produce things, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=588.48s)]
*  and then we just ship it all over the world and sell it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=589.92s)]
*  And, you know, protectionism was at a minimum. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=592.8s)]
*  And because everything has changed, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=596.72s)]
*  it means that now that you implement tariffs, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=598.88s)]
*  it's not going to have the same impact [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=602.0s)]
*  as it did back in the 1930s. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=603.6s)]
*  And the consequences of implementing tariffs [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=605.76s)]
*  to such a great degree across the world is huge. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=609.96s)]
*  And we're seeing the markets playing out the fear factor [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  of what the impact could be on the global economy, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=617.68s)]
*  because you can't just unravel supply chains that are global [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=620.4s)]
*  and all the various aspects of business and commerce [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=624.48s)]
*  that have been crossing borders very easily for decades. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=627.0s)]
*  And you're not going to suddenly be able to build a factory [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=631.3199999999999s)]
*  in America and make goods and sell them in America [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=633.64s)]
*  with American workers. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=635.84s)]
*  It's not going to happen quickly, and that's the worry. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=637.0s)]
*  So for US citizens, for many of us around the world, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=640.24s)]
*  we'll really see the prices going up, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  because things will become more expensive. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=646.48s)]
*  And as much as businesses will try and take on board the costs [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=648.1999999999999s)]
*  and not pass it on, I think in many cases they'll be forced. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=653.0s)]
*  They'll have to pass it on to the consumer. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=655.52s)]
*  Sally, thank you very much. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=657.48s)]
*  Well, let's speak to Yael Selfin, who's vice chair [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=660.2s)]
*  and chief economist at KPMG in the UK. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=662.48s)]
*  Yael, thank you very much for talking to us. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=665.64s)]
*  What are you making of all these red arrows pointing downwards [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=667.44s)]
*  across the markets? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=670.6s)]
*  It is a worry, at least a short-term worry, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=672.72s)]
*  because essentially what it tells us [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=674.96s)]
*  is that business confidence is very low, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=677.08s)]
*  and that will have implications on business investment. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=681.08s)]
*  It will have implications on the way consumers decide [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=685.12s)]
*  to spend their money. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  So beyond the impact of the actual tariffs, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=690.24s)]
*  we're seeing additional effects from these falls [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=695.12s)]
*  in the stock market. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=701.1600000000001s)]
*  There are many, many calls going into the White House [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=703.5600000000001s)]
*  from global leaders wanting to do a deal, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=707.4s)]
*  hoping that in some way they will find their country's way [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=710.68s)]
*  out of these tariffs. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=713.28s)]
*  How many hopes are being pinned on the results of those calls, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=714.68s)]
*  do you think? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=717.8s)]
*  Well, it doesn't seem that likely that we will have a change [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=720.12s)]
*  in tariffs. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=724.76s)]
*  What the hope is that you won't see an escalation [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=725.52s)]
*  and many more retaliatory measures in the coming days [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=728.72s)]
*  and weeks, because that will make the impact [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=735.12s)]
*  on the global economy even worse, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=738.04s)]
*  especially on the countries that are going to put on [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=740.96s)]
*  these additional tariffs. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=744.72s)]
*  And, Yael, we talked about this so much [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=747.08s)]
*  following the financial crisis of 2008, 2009. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=749.24s)]
*  How does a crisis in the markets translate [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=753.2s)]
*  into a real-life economic crisis that people feel? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=756.8s)]
*  Well, if you've got markets that seize up, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=761.56s)]
*  it means that there's less liquidity [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=765.2399999999999s)]
*  and it means that companies have less money, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=767.5999999999999s)]
*  they can borrow less money, people can borrow less money, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=771.28s)]
*  or it is more expensive to borrow money [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=774.52s)]
*  and then invest it or spend it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=778.5999999999999s)]
*  So that is a big worry. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=780.56s)]
*  Hopefully we're not there and things will come down. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=782.1999999999999s)]
*  So I think that we're a little bit far from that yet, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  hopefully. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=790.1199999999999s)]
*  Right, so if you're a company whose share price is tanking, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=790.9599999999999s)]
*  that will potentially result in an inability or a difficulty [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=795.48s)]
*  in securing loans, securing finance, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  and that's when people start to feel the outcome [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=801.92s)]
*  of what's going on in the markets. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=804.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, some of the companies that are affected [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=808.4s)]
*  are those that are going to find it harder to sell [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=812.4399999999999s)]
*  to the US market and those whose larger proportion [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  of their products go to the US market. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=820.6s)]
*  So they will need to adjust given that, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=822.84s)]
*  beyond the fact that the share price is going down. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=826.32s)]
*  Yael, I'm just looking at a figure that's just come in [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=832.76s)]
*  because Hong Kong stocks have ended 13.12% down. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=835.12s)]
*  That is the worst since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=839.5600000000001s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=844.96s)]
*  So it does seem that Asia is going to be affected [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=846.88s)]
*  particularly badly from these tariffs. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=851.92s)]
*  It's not the tariffs on China, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=855.16s)]
*  it's tariffs on other economies. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=857.56s)]
*  These are economies that are fairly highly dependent [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=860.32s)]
*  on trade to the US and other Western economies. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=864.52s)]
*  So that is going to be very disruptive [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=868.8s)]
*  for these economies in particular. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=871.6s)]
*  So it's not surprising if you like to some degree [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=874.84s)]
*  that you have a big correction there. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=878.12s)]
*  When you hear Donald Trump saying on Air Force One, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=881.24s)]
*  as he did to reporters overnight, it's like taking medicine. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=884.48s)]
*  Sometimes you have to take the medicine. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=888.36s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=891.4s)]
*  So will this medicine work? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=892.6800000000001s)]
*  What's going to be the side effects of these medicines? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=894.12s)]
*  Well, I think tariffs on their own are not really [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=898.16s)]
*  a good way to try and readjust an economy [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=901.88s)]
*  and potentially therefore this is not necessarily [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=905.04s)]
*  the best route to take in terms of economic policy. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=910.5999999999999s)]
*  The US has a trade deficit for a reason [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=914.9599999999999s)]
*  and it is a little bit complex to go through in one minute, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=919.24s)]
*  but essentially there's not necessarily [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=923.36s)]
*  a problem there as such and there's other ways [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  in which you could build a stronger economy [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=929.7199999999999s)]
*  with trade and without tariffs. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=933.24s)]
*  How long do you think this particular low point [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=936.48s)]
*  where there is real sense of panic and uncertainty, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=940.24s)]
*  how long do you think this will go on for? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=943.24s)]
*  Well, it feels like the reaction is mainly a recognition [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=945.72s)]
*  that there's not going to be a quick fix. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=951.0s)]
*  Now that we've gone past that, the big issue [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=953.48s)]
*  is to try and understand where we are on tariffs [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=956.68s)]
*  and try and work through it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=960.12s)]
*  So hopefully this is a matter of a week or so [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=961.6s)]
*  until we get more clarity. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=965.24s)]
*  It's the uncertainty that makes things worse [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=966.8s)]
*  at the due stage. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=970.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, thank you very much. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifDx_7kUL6g&t=971.4s)]
