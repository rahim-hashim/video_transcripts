# Israel issues new evacuation order in Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA)
*  Israel has issued a new evacuation order for southern Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the biggest such order since Israel relaunched its offensive in the Palestinian [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=3.2s)]
*  territory earlier this month. We've been listening to Israeli army radio which says evacuation orders [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=7.28s)]
*  now apply to about a fifth of Gaza. The health ministry there which is run by Hamas said more [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  than a thousand people have now been killed in the territory since Israel resumed its strikes. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=18.16s)]
*  Here's our Middle East correspondent Yulana Nel explaining where people go when evacuation orders [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=23.28s)]
*  are issued. Well what happens usually is that the Israeli military through its Arabic spokesman puts [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=27.6s)]
*  out these notifications on social media. One came through this morning showing this big area [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  of the southernmost part of Gaza along the border with Egypt covering all of Ra'afah, parts of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=41.6s)]
*  Khan Yunus, all of that in red and people being told that they should flee to Al Mawasi. This is a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=47.92s)]
*  coastal area, a sprawling tented camp area now and we have been hearing from BBC journalists there [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=56.24s)]
*  that people have started to arrive. They rapidly packed up their belongings. People, tens of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  thousands of them had gone back particularly to the eastern part of Ra'afah after the Israeli [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=72.08s)]
*  military withdrawal during the recent two months of ceasefire. A lot of Ra'afah had been left in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=78.72s)]
*  ruins by the Israeli military offensive that began there last May but people did find in the east [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=84.8s)]
*  some buildings to go back to. Now Eid al-Fitr, it's the important Islamic holiday of course but [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=91.28s)]
*  people have not really been able to mark that instead that they have been fleeing once again [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=98.56s)]
*  heading off to this area in the coast, some also going to Al-Tahan Yunus a bit further to the north. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=103.6s)]
*  And just briefly Yulad, where are we at in terms of any new negotiations over another ceasefire? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=110.56s)]
*  Well Israel has been insisting that it is continuing with these negotiations. Hamas [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=117.92s)]
*  was said on Saturday to have agreed to an Egyptian proposal basically to release five [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=123.84s)]
*  living hostages in exchange we understand for a 50 day ceasefire. However Israel said to have [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=130.0s)]
*  put forward a counter proposal with the backing of the US demanding a larger number of hostages [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=137.76s)]
*  to be released. The big sticking point remains of course Hamas's demand that there should be a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  discussion about ending the war in Gaza with Israel not showing real willingness to talk about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  that. Although the Israeli prime minister did say yesterday that ministers had voted to increase [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=157.76s)]
*  the military action intensified in Gaza and he said that methods were working really to put [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=165.68s)]
*  pressure on Hamas to agree to a new hostage release deal and ceasefire. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5t0-iaJDYA&t=172.24s)]
