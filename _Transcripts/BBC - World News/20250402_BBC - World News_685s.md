Video Description: The ruling military junta in Myanmar said the death toll after last week's devastating earthquake now stands at almost 2,900 people.
 
It is feared that the actual death toll is much higher, with many people still stuck under the rubble in affected cities.
 
The ruling military junta declared that it will not let foreign journalists into the country after the earthquake making it hard to report from the country.
 
The BBC's Yogita Limaye has become the first foreign journalist to enter the country since the disaster struck and travelled to the city of Mandalay.

# BBC finds huge devastation and little help for Myanmar quake survivors | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU)
*  Yogita has become one of the first foreign journalists to enter Myanmar since the quake [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=0.0s)]
*  and she has compiled this exclusive report on what she found there. The military government [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=5.28s)]
*  says that the number of people to have died in that powerful quake on Friday is nearing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=9.92s)]
*  2,900, but as you will see in just a moment from Yogita's report, the actual death toll [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=14.4s)]
*  could be much higher. The BBC's Burmese service has been reporting from the heart of the Myanmar [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=20.16s)]
*  earthquake, but the ruling military government, which seized power in 2021, has not allowed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=25.96s)]
*  foreign journalists into the country since the disaster and that is why Yogita travelled there [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  undercover to show the extent of the earthquake and to witness the aftermath. She made it through [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=36.44s)]
*  to Mandalay, close to the epicentre. Here is her full report. Just to warn you, you may find some [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=41.24s)]
*  of the images, particularly at the beginning, a difficult watch. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=46.44s)]
*  A densely populated city that took the direct hit of the biggest earthquake to rock this country [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=50.44s)]
*  in a century. As we drove into Mandalay, bit by bit, we witnessed the scale of the devastation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=56.36s)]
*  Nearly every street we turned into, we saw scenes like this. Myanmar has said it's not allowing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=63.72s)]
*  foreign journalists in since the earthquake. We went in undercover to show the extent of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  impact. Access to the major collapse sites was difficult. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=76.6s)]
*  But we managed to slip in to see this Buddhist academy, where scores of monks are fear-trapped. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=85.16s)]
*  Rescuers who've arrived from India are trying to dig them out, but they told us, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=93.32s)]
*  in this kind of collapse, it's unlikely they'll find survivors. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=97.8s)]
*  It's unlikely they'll find survivors. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=102.68s)]
*  We've heard varying estimates of how many people might be trapped inside here, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=107.0s)]
*  something more than 80, others say more than 100. When the earthquake struck, Buddhist monks were [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  taking an exam in an examination hall, and the floors collapsed one on top of the other, trapping [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=116.36s)]
*  them underneath these concrete blocks. What's also making the rescue operation even more difficult [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=123.24s)]
*  is how hot it is. It's really sweltering, and just from everywhere around us, we can smell dead bodies. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=132.6s)]
*  It takes them a few hours to finally manage to pull one body out. The work is demanding and slow. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  Families who've been waiting in the compound for news of their loved ones rush to the ambulance [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=154.12s)]
*  to take a look. The stench here is now overwhelming. An official shows a photo and explains that the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=159.24s)]
*  body was found crushed under a pillar, agonising moments pass as the families try to identify the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  dead man, but he's not recognisable. 29-year-old Uth Hosana is one of those who was taking the exam. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=179.88s)]
*  His father, a farmer, Ula Ong tells us, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=196.28s)]
*  I'm in consolable, I'm filled with grief. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  In this moment of loss, the only solace these families have is that someone is looking for their sons. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  But we saw multiple sites where rescuers haven't even reached. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=219.72s)]
*  This is a hotel that was being converted into an office space. Five workers were trapped inside. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=223.0s)]
*  One of them is 21-year-old Saihan Pan. His mother, Nan Shin Hein, has been waiting on the street [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=230.6s)]
*  outside for nearly five days for someone to go and search for her son. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=237.48s)]
*  I'm very distressed. I'm just holding on, hoping to see my son's face. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=246.36s)]
*  Whether he's dead or alive, I just want to see his body. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=250.68s)]
*  Not far away, we stop when we see a funeral ritual being carried out just by the side of the road. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=255.0s)]
*  The destroyed home behind belonged to a couple in their 60s, Ula Ong Kheng and his wife, Dao Ma Maithil. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=261.56s)]
*  Their bodies were dug out from this rubble not by authorities, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=271.32s)]
*  but by locals using basic equipment. They were found with their arms around each other. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=275.0s)]
*  It's unclear if these deaths are being counted or if we'll ever know how many have really died. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=282.04s)]
*  We're seeing scenes of destruction like this one across Mandalay and the reality on the ground is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=288.92s)]
*  there just aren't enough pairs of hands to dig through the rubble to look for survivors or even [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=294.12s)]
*  the dead. And a large part of the reason for that is the complicated political scenario in this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=299.4s)]
*  country. It's got a civil war going on and since 2021 it's been run by a military government which [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=304.04s)]
*  took control in a coup. Myanmar's ruling junta has uneasy relations with many foreign countries, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=310.12s)]
*  especially western nations, which means more foreign manpower cannot freely come in. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=318.44s)]
*  This has already hampered the possibility of finding survivors. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  We also managed to slip into Mandalay's main hospital, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=329.72s)]
*  where we found more evidence of how overwhelmed facilities are. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=333.0s)]
*  What we're seeing here is hospitals that are stretched past capacity and they can't even go [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=341.48s)]
*  inside because the building is damaged and so people are just being treated here outside. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  There's a shortage of medicines, of blood. The Myanmar government is not even able to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=351.72s)]
*  get the medicines. The government has put out an appeal for all of those things but much more [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=357.32s)]
*  is needed here. 14-year-old Shwe Ghee Tung Fu has an injury to her head. She's responsive [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=363.48s)]
*  but in a serious condition. Her family by her side. In another bed, Zaza says she has an [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=371.32s)]
*  abdominal injury. Her daughter propping her up. Everywhere we see families who are stepping in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=379.4s)]
*  to do what trained medical staff should. There aren't enough doctors or nurses. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  We had to leave quickly for fear of being apprehended by authorities [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  and we couldn't go to see if the morgue was also overwhelmed. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  The parks and spaces all over the city have become makeshift camps for those displaced by the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=402.44s)]
*  earthquake. There's no official count of how many have lost their homes. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=406.91999999999996s)]
*  The aid distribution we saw was largely being carried out by small groups with limited stocks. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=413.88s)]
*  Not enough supplies for the enormous needs. People scrambling to take what they can get. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=420.28s)]
*  We met Daokin So Minth who tells us she's lost her home. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=431.96s)]
*  I don't know anything anymore. My heart is still trembling. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=445.08s)]
*  It's really difficult. My house collapsed. It's gone. There's no one to rescue us. Please help us. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=449.08s)]
*  Yoghurt, such a powerful report that we just saw there from Mandalay. Some of the images that you [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=462.28s)]
*  saw, we were talking about the images of destruction. But also you were really struck by the plight [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=468.84s)]
*  of those who are now outside, people who don't have shelter, people who are waiting for help, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=474.52s)]
*  in some cases which is not arriving. I mean literally when you go into the city, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=480.12s)]
*  there's no people don't live in the buildings in the night. As soon as you know it's evening, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=486.04s)]
*  people are pulling out mattresses, mats, blankets. They take their cars. There's a big moat that runs [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=491.48s)]
*  around the palace and there are banks that run about the moat. So people go and park their cars [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=497.72s)]
*  and they put all of that out whole families, elderly people, young children. And they're all [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=503.32s)]
*  just basically sleeping on the streets. And the reason for that, as I was saying earlier, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=508.6s)]
*  any building you walk into, you will see some cracks. And there have been multiple aftershocks. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=513.48s)]
*  So the aftershock that we experienced, which was in the middle of the night at about one or two am, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  it was a magnitude five shock. So it was quite vigorous. And we were sort of sleeping under [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  some shelter and we ran out as well and everybody came running out. And you can really see the trauma [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=531.64s)]
*  on people's faces. So even though they're hesitant to talk, the minute you ask them, just a little [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=536.12s)]
*  something, people start crying and they're like, please help us. We've run out in this set of clothes. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=540.76s)]
*  We don't have anything else on us. We've got a bit of rice. We've got a bit of water. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=546.92s)]
*  And so you don't know when these people are going to feel confident enough to go back in, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=553.16s)]
*  because realistically speaking, how are you going to go and assess structurally that all these [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=559.16s)]
*  buildings will be okay and people can go back in living? And when do these aftershocks stop? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=565.08s)]
*  There are no answers to these questions. So I'd say it definitely felt like a very fearful city. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=570.76s)]
*  We were out eating, I remember, dinner and somebody yelled, it's shaking, it's shaking. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=577.08s)]
*  And we don't actually know whether there was a tremor or not, but somebody felt it. And everybody [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=583.0s)]
*  ran out and there was such a panic. And that's trauma for these people who are living through it [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=587.0s)]
*  day after day. And we're about to see some of the images from your report, but I suppose just briefly [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=593.48s)]
*  as a final thought from you, really, this is something that will continue. This is not the end [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=600.2s)]
*  of this story. It's the beginning of this story for those people that you talk about. They will [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=605.4000000000001s)]
*  endure this for weeks, for months, for years to come. They will. I mean, this is something that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=609.0s)]
*  will stay with them for a long time. There are, of course, people who've lost loved ones, and that's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=613.96s)]
*  irreparable in their lives. But also to build back the confidence to go back into their homes and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=618.6800000000001s)]
*  the economic losses that have been suffered in a country that's already at civil war. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=625.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a very difficult situation. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=630.9200000000001s)]
*  Yogita, thank you so much for your reporting, for being with us, for telling us more about it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=633.88s)]
*  And if you want to read more about Yogita's trip into Myanmar, you can find that on the BBC [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=638.6s)]
*  News website. But we'll leave you for now with some of the powerful images from her reporting. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=644.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyopKCy7BU&t=674.6s)]
