Video Description: President Donald Trump's new travel ban which bars citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States has come into effect.
The order, which Trump signed last week, restricts the nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US.
Nationals from a further seven countries - Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - will face partial travel restrictions.
The US president said the list could be revised if "material improvements" were made, while other countries could be added as "threats emerge around the world".

# US travel ban barring citizens from 12 countries takes effect | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI)
*  President Trump's travel ban has come into effect, with the order primarily impacting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=0.0s)]
*  countries in Africa and the Middle East. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Twelve countries face full bans, Iran and Afghanistan identified by the Trump administration [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  as sponsors of terrorism, while African states such as Equatorial Guinea and Chad were said [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=11.48s)]
*  to have high rates of migrants to the US overstaying their initial visas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=16.92s)]
*  Seven additional countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Burundi face a partial ban. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=21.8s)]
*  Mr Trump said the US could not have what he called open migration from countries which [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=26.96s)]
*  lacked proper vetting procedures. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=31.68s)]
*  The measures are similar to the travel ban issued during Mr Trump's first term in office [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=34.2s)]
*  when he had banned travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=38.24s)]
*  The UN Human Rights Chief has warned that the broad and sweeping nature of this new [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=42.56s)]
*  travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=47.2s)]
*  US Democratic lawmakers blasting the ban is draconian and unconstitutional. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=51.0s)]
*  Our senior Africa correspondent Anne Sawyer is in Nairobi. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=56.2s)]
*  She told us that the advance notice of this ban has at least made it a little less chaotic [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=58.64s)]
*  than the one implemented during the first term. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  What analysts think is that it avoids the chaos that we witnessed in 2017 during President [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=66.88s)]
*  Trump's first term when he announced a travel ban and it took effect immediately. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=72.44s)]
*  And people who were already airborne travelling to the US were then caught up in that situation, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  many of them detained at the airport. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=84.36s)]
*  The fact that there is an advance notice this time means that those chaotic scenes may be [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  avoided. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  The people who also have permanent residency and green cards have also been exempted from [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=92.6s)]
*  the current ban. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  And you remember that in 2017, the United States government was sued in US courts and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=100.44s)]
*  the lower courts did temporarily put on hold the ban, but eventually the US Supreme Court [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=107.88s)]
*  after the ban was revised then lifted it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=115.52s)]
*  And therefore this time round, 12 countries, as you say, affected with a total ban and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  another six affected by a partial ban targeting certain classes of visas. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W9YxOvbnTI&t=125.39999999999999s)]
