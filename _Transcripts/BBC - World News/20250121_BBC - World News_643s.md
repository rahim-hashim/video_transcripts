*  Let's give you an update on developments in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=0.0s)]
*  There's been a tense calm in Gaza as the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has held into a third [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=3.36s)]
*  day. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=8.56s)]
*  This is the scene live in Rafa in Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=9.56s)]
*  Hamas has confirmed it will release the next Israeli hostages on Saturday in exchange for [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians held by Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=17.28s)]
*  The UN said more than 900 aid trucks had entered the territory on Monday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=19.8s)]
*  President Trump has expressed doubt that the truth will hold through all of the three phases. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=24.72s)]
*  One of his executive orders reversed sanctions on extremist Israeli settlers in the occupied [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=29.56s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=35.199999999999996s)]
*  Well, to get the very latest, I'm joined now by our Middle East correspondent Yolan Nel, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=36.2s)]
*  who is in Jerusalem. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=41.12s)]
*  So, day three and the ceasefire is still holding. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=42.12s)]
*  First of all, let me ask you about the reaction to that on the ground where you are. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=46.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there is on the positive side this news about the humanitarian aid going [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=51.32s)]
*  into Gaza, the amount of it really exceeding expectations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=58.6s)]
*  We've also had this new Hamas statement reaffirming that the next Israeli hostages, that's expected [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=63.64s)]
*  to be four women hostages, will be released on Saturday in exchange for more Palestinian [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=69.84s)]
*  prisoners being released from Israeli jails. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=75.88s)]
*  But at the same time, there is great nervousness about discussions that are due to begin in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=79.28s)]
*  two weeks' time on the next stage of the deal, which should end the war completely in Gaza [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=84.64s)]
*  and bring home the remaining Israeli hostages, the majority of those still being held by [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=91.36s)]
*  Hamas there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  And President Trump didn't really allay those fears when he was asked by reporters in the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=99.16s)]
*  Oval Office if he thought that all three phases of this ceasefire and hostage release deal [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  that he has been taking credit for would be implemented. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=109.8s)]
*  He said to reporters, it's not our war, it's their war. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=114.56s)]
*  I'm not confident. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=117.64s)]
*  But at the same time, we have been hearing from his new special envoy to the Middle East, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=119.64s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, who was also very much involved in those indirect negotiations between Israel [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=124.36s)]
*  and Hamas. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=130.52s)]
*  And he was indicating his ongoing commitment to this deal being implemented, outlining [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=132.24s)]
*  what he said was President Trump's bold vision for the Middle East and seeking to ultimately [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=138.52s)]
*  build new relations between Israel and other Arab countries, dangling out there the possibility [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  that there could be a normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia down the road. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=152.68s)]
*  And while you are there, Yoland, any more reaction, of course you've mentioned Donald [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=156.72s)]
*  Trump there, but any more reaction to his presidency now? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=161.72s)]
*  He's officially become president again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=166.28s)]
*  I mean, certainly we had comments from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=168.84s)]
*  saying that, of course, the US being Israel's closest ally, he is seeking to build on that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=175.72s)]
*  close alliance. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=182.52s)]
*  What has really made a lot of headlines here in the Israeli media is another decision by [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=184.08s)]
*  the Trump administration to rescind US sanctions on extremist Jewish settlers that were introduced [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=188.76s)]
*  by the Biden administration, really amid growing international frustration about what's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  been seen as Israel's failure to rein in this rise in extremist violence against Palestinians [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=202.08s)]
*  in the occupied West Bank. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  And just hours after that was rescinded, we had the news coming from the north of the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=211.08s)]
*  West Bank that there had been a new settler rampage that had gone on, with videos now [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=217.12s)]
*  coming out showing masked men going around setting fire to Palestinian cars and property [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=222.68s)]
*  in a couple of villages. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  OK, Yoland, thank you very much for bringing us up to date on all of those different developments [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  related to the ceasefire. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=237.84s)]
*  Well let's now cross to Tel Aviv and speak to political analyst Akiva Elder, who's also [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=240.36s)]
*  a contributor to the Haaretz newspaper. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=245.8s)]
*  Welcome to BBC News. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=248.68s)]
*  The ceasefire is now into a third day. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=252.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's not confident it will get through all of the three stages. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=255.56s)]
*  What's the mood where you are in terms of that? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=260.84s)]
*  Do people that you're speaking to, particularly say in the Israeli government, believe that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=263.52s)]
*  it will last those three phases? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=267.4s)]
*  Well what we are looking at right now, Jeannie, is I could say it's Trump's trap. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=271.68s)]
*  Netanyahu is trapped between President Trump, who has great appetite to receive the Nobel [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=280.32s)]
*  Peace Prize. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=290.2s)]
*  He cannot forgive the committee for offering it, giving it to President Obama, and why [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=292.2s)]
*  not to him? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=298.16s)]
*  And he sees here an opportunity, a unique opportunity to make peace in the Middle East, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  and the return of the captives is just the appetizer. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=307.28s)]
*  He as your correspondent just mentioned, he is interested in a comprehensive peace to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=312.96s)]
*  bring in Saudi Arabia and to complete the Abraham Accords that he managed to pass four [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=320.92s)]
*  years ago, just before the American elections where he was defeated. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=330.28s)]
*  On the other hand, Netanyahu is trapped by the radical right, the zealots, Benkver, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=335.6s)]
*  who has resigned from the government, and Smutrich, who is still there, but he's holding [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=343.2s)]
*  a gun to Netanyahu's head, and he said, if we will not go back to Gaza, and this is something [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=350.44s)]
*  that I believe we have to watch very carefully, because according to the Israeli Declaration [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=358.56s)]
*  of Independence, the vision of Zionism is to reach out to our neighbors for peace. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=367.48s)]
*  Now, what he's actually demanding is resumption of the war. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=375.68s)]
*  Let me ask you this, Mr. Elder. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=382.04s)]
*  So you talk about the pressures on Mr. Netanyahu from various angles. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=384.0s)]
*  How safe is his position, do you think? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  I believe that he will not be able to eat this cake and have it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=396.44s)]
*  I think that we are looking at the countdown because he has gambled on both Trump, Smutrich, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  and Benkver, and it seems that none of them is willing to deliver the goods without a [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=412.32s)]
*  price tag that Netanyahu cannot afford. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=420.92s)]
*  He cannot afford to offer a Palestinian state to the Palestinian Authority. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=425.24s)]
*  He doesn't even think about considering allowing the Palestinian Authority, Abu Mazen, to take [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=431.84s)]
*  over the responsibility on humanitarian aid to Gaza. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=439.76s)]
*  On the other hand, he is still claiming that he can bring a total victory in this war. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  So I think that he is in a complete deadlock, let alone the trial that the three judges [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=454.92s)]
*  who are waiting for him and the International Criminal Court arrest warrants that are not [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=464.0s)]
*  going anywhere. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  Challenging times for Mr. Netanyahu, as you have outlined there, Akiva Elder. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, Regina. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=484.0s)]
*  Reza. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=485.0s)]
*  Well, let's look at the aid situation now that ceasefire has begun. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=486.0s)]
*  Let's speak to Jorge Moreira de Silva, the Executive Director of UN Operations for Gaza. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=490.44s)]
*  It's good to have you with us on BBC News at what must be an incredibly busy time for [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  your agency. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=500.91999999999996s)]
*  Just bring us up to date on where we are in terms of aid now reaching the most needed [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=502.76s)]
*  part of Gaza. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=509.12s)]
*  Thank you, Regina. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=512.16s)]
*  As you said, UNOPS works in 100 countries and particularly focusing these days in Gaza. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=513.36s)]
*  And we have seen in the last two days a significant increase of aid being provided and delivered. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=519.8s)]
*  And this is fundamental. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=526.1999999999999s)]
*  We know that Gaza has faced unprecedented level of suffering, human suffering, humanitarian [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=527.7199999999999s)]
*  aid tragedy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=536.0s)]
*  So it's important that we use these 42 days to provide all aid that is needed. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=537.04s)]
*  How many trucks have gone through then? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=542.28s)]
*  Because that's one of the questions really. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=544.68s)]
*  There is some aid going through, but is it enough? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=546.48s)]
*  Well, the Sec General said that in the first day we managed to get 630 trucks, which is [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=549.64s)]
*  more than the minimum that was planted in the ceasefire. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=557.44s)]
*  But let me give you one example from my own agency. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=561.44s)]
*  We are procuring and delivering fuel into Gaza. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=564.88s)]
*  We know that fuel is fundamental to everything that happens in Gaza, from the health to the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=568.92s)]
*  bakeries, to the houses. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=575.64s)]
*  And we managed in the first day of the ceasefire to bring one million liters of fuel to Gaza. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  So that everyone understands this represents 10 times more than what we've been managed [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=584.92s)]
*  to bring on average in the previous months. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=593.16s)]
*  So in just one day we brought 10 times what we were able to bring before. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=597.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=601.2s)]
*  Because finally the security and the political conditions have allowed us to bring the fuel. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=602.2s)]
*  And this is a fundamental element. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=607.48s)]
*  The UN is ready to provide the support for people if the security and the political conditions [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=609.48s)]
*  allow. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=615.6s)]
*  And that's why we shall do whatever is possible during these 42 days to provide humanitarian [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=616.6s)]
*  aid, but also to prepare for early recovery and reconstruction. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=622.12s)]
*  We are also seeing that 70% of the infrastructure in Gaza is destroyed. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=626.08s)]
*  And this represents more than $18.5 billion of damage on infrastructure. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=630.88s)]
*  So let's provide aid, short-term humanitarian aid, but let's prepare for early recovery [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=635.84s)]
*  and reconstruction. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAoDACNkMA&t=641.6800000000001s)]
