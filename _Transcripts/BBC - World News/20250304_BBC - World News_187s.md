Video Description: More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050, according to a study in The Lancet.
 
Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries.
 
The study predicts that China (627 million), India (450 million) and the US (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050.
 
And population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.

# Over 50% of adults worldwide predicted to be obese or overweight by 2050 | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4)
*  Now, researchers have warned that obesity levels are predicted to rise rapidly until [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=0.0s)]
*  the end of the decade. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=4.8s)]
*  A new report published by The Lancet Journal has found that more than half of all adults [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=5.8s)]
*  around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=10.28s)]
*  But if governments take action now, there's still time to prevent what they describe as [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=14.0s)]
*  a profound tragedy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=19.0s)]
*  Well, for more on this, let's speak to Thorkeild Sorensen, Professor of Genetic and Metabolic [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=20.32s)]
*  Epidemiology at the University of Copenhagen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=26.0s)]
*  Welcome to BBC News. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=30.04s)]
*  Just tell us more about this study that we've seen in The Lancet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=32.88s)]
*  I think this is a great study really telling us what has happened through the last decades [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  in the world in terms of the obesity pandemic. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=44.66s)]
*  I think it's worth recalling it a pandemic because it's obviously affecting all countries [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=47.24s)]
*  in this world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=52.6s)]
*  And also, they are doing a very good job in trying to predict what happens in the future [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=54.54s)]
*  with the pandemic. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=59.22s)]
*  And it's really a scary outcome out of this forecast. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  So from being a little bit above 1 billion people living with obesity these days, it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=66.58s)]
*  will rise to more than double in 2050. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=74.26s)]
*  And this is really scary considering all the serious comorbidities and burdens that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=79.66s)]
*  follows such development of obesity, both for the individuals and the societies in general. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=86.02s)]
*  I wanted to ask you aboutâ€¦ [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=91.66s)]
*  I think it's an extremely valuable study that these groups have produced. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=93.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=98.22s)]
*  And this study, of course, covers some 200 countries. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=99.22s)]
*  I wondered if you had a breakdown on where some of the biggest changes are. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  For example, I remember when I was a reporter in India seeing that as the economy grew there, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=107.46s)]
*  obesity also grew. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=114.82s)]
*  Is that a trend that you're seeing in some of these kind of emerging economies? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=115.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is a general pattern that as what we consider the welfare system with [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=120.46s)]
*  food abundance develops, then we see as a kind of a side effect of that, that fractions [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=127.86s)]
*  of the people in these countries where they're really having the development of the economy, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  as you say, they are for some reasons we don't really understand developing obesity with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=138.02s)]
*  all its bad effects on health. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=143.06s)]
*  So you are right in that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=145.94s)]
*  And there's a very heterogeneous picture around the world about who is most affected, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=147.38s)]
*  where is it changing most rapidly, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  And this is a very good feature of this report that you can just look up in their data to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  see how is your part of where you live in the world affected and what's the forecast [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=162.34s)]
*  for your part. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=167.86s)]
*  And I think this is an extremely helpful tool for people considering how to oppose this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=169.26s)]
*  pandemic in the best possible way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=176.58s)]
*  OK, thank you so much, Thor Kiel-Torrensson, Professor of Genetic and Metabolic Epidemiology [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=179.02s)]
*  at the University of Copenhagen. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adlanc4K7S4&t=185.14000000000001s)]
