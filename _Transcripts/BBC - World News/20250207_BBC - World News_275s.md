# Withdraw from Democratic Republic of Congo, UN rights chief urges Rwanda | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI)
*  The UN Human Rights Chief has warned that the conflict in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo risks spreading, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=0.0s)]
*  and the worst violence may yet be to come. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=7.0s)]
*  Volker Turk was speaking at an emergency session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=10.0s)]
*  Rwandan-backed M23 fighters took the city of Goma last week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=15.0s)]
*  There are reports of widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=19.0s)]
*  Let's speak now to our Africa correspondent, Barbara Plett-Ussher, who's in Nairobi. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=26.0s)]
*  Barbara, hello to you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=30.0s)]
*  There have been hopes that the presidents of the respective countries, DRC and Rwanda, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=32.0s)]
*  could get together and have talks that might lead to an end to this conflict. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=38.0s)]
*  Is there any further development on that? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=43.0s)]
*  Yes, there is a special summit planned for tomorrow, Saturday. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=48.0s)]
*  It's organized by two African regional groupings, the East African community and the Southern African community. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=52.0s)]
*  And both leaders have said they will attend. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=59.0s)]
*  So if they both go in person, that would be quite a moment, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=62.0s)]
*  because it's been very hard to get them around the same table in the past months. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=65.0s)]
*  But we're not clear whether the Congolese leader will attend in person or whether he'll attend virtually. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=69.0s)]
*  And there have already been two emergency summits, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=76.0s)]
*  one by the East African community and one by the Southern African one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=79.0s)]
*  And now they're bringing their forces together to again try to address this conflict [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=83.0s)]
*  because the concern is growing that it is going to escalate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=88.0s)]
*  And there is a concern that it escalates beyond the borders of the Democratic Republic of Congo, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=91.0s)]
*  not to mention the great damage it has already done, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=96.0s)]
*  the people who've been killed, the interruption to services, the humanitarian crisis. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=99.0s)]
*  So there is pressure from the concerns of the region. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=103.0s)]
*  Also, you heard that you mentioned the UN official there at the Human Rights Council, the UN Secretary General. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=107.0s)]
*  They've all got this same warning that things could get much worse. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=112.0s)]
*  Whether that leads to some kind of resolution seems to me unlikely, given the dynamics. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=116.0s)]
*  But maybe the hope is that there could be a ceasefire and the talks could continue. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah. On the substance that the two leaders might get into, whether they attend in person or virtually, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=127.0s)]
*  what would be the starting point, do you think, for those discussions in terms of trying to actually at least reach a ceasefire? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=134.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question because they're very far apart. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=140.0s)]
*  So the Rwandans, so the Democratic Republic of Congo accuses Rwanda of backing these rebels, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=145.0s)]
*  saying that it has invaded the country with thousands of its troops to provide them military support and weapons. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=152.0s)]
*  In fact, there is evidence for that in a UN report that Rwanda is actively engaged, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=157.0s)]
*  although the Rwandans have never admitted that that's the case. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=162.0s)]
*  What they say is that they are doing whatever it takes to protect their border. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=166.0s)]
*  But what their position is, is that this is a Congolese problem. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=170.0s)]
*  This is a Congolese civil war and they need to talk to each other. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=173.0s)]
*  The Congolese government needs to talk to the rebels. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=177.0s)]
*  That is something that it has some support for from some African countries. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=180.0s)]
*  The Congolese, on the other hand, are absolutely against that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=183.0s)]
*  They say this isn't about the rebels. It's not about the M23 rebels. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=186.0s)]
*  Those are the puppets. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=189.0s)]
*  We want to speak essentially to the puppet master, is how you might want to phrase it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=191.0s)]
*  They haven't used that word, but they don't want to be speaking to a force that they feel is not really directing things on the ground. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=195.0s)]
*  They've also designated them as terrorists. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=201.0s)]
*  So I don't know if you can bring those two things together. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=203.0s)]
*  What the Congolese have said is that what they're going to be asking for at this meeting is sanctions against Rwanda, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=206.0s)]
*  a call for all unwanted foreign forces to leave and for a formal ceasefire. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=212.0s)]
*  So it's unclear how you might get to that ceasefire. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=217.0s)]
*  Certainly it's not clear at all that there could be a deeper resolution behind that now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=221.0s)]
*  But I think the concern right now is to stop the advance of the rebels and to stop the violence long enough to try to get some talks going. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=227.0s)]
*  And briefly, Barbara, is the rebel group, the M23 fighters, are they saying anything? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=235.0s)]
*  They have not really been talking about the summit. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=241.0s)]
*  No, they are not involved in the peace process. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=246.0s)]
*  As I said, the Congolese don't accept them as an interlocutor. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=251.0s)]
*  What they have been saying is about their military advance. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=254.0s)]
*  They have taken over Goma. They have started to put an administration in place. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=258.0s)]
*  They are continuing to advance further south. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=261.0s)]
*  And the leadership says, and it's a rebel alliance actually, of which the M23 is apart, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=264.0s)]
*  they say we want to go all the way to Kinshasa. We want to overthrow the Congolese government. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=268.0s)]
*  OK, Barbara, thank you very much. Barbara Pletasha in Nairobi. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9pGtTTPUI&t=272.0s)]
