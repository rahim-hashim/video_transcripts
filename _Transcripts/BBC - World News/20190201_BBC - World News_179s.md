# 'My skating coach sexually abused me' - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 01, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU)
*  The world of elite speed skating here in South Korea has been rocked by allegations of physical and sexual abuse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a country that has won 24 Olympic gold medals, but now the standards, the quality of the coaching is being brought into question. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Five women have come forward and raised their voices. We've been speaking to one of them anonymously. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=16.0s)]
*  I was in my first year at high school, 16 years old. It was at a public space at an ice rink. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=23.6s)]
*  My coach hugged me and kissed me. He would call me into a separate room alone and touch me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=29.8s)]
*  He texted me, I love you, and asked me to go to a movie theater or have dinner. It lasted for two years and then I left the team. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=36.0s)]
*  What did you think then? What was going through your brain? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=43.6s)]
*  I felt dirty, but I couldn't say no to his face because I thought my life as an athlete would end if I left him or said no to him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  The pressure was harsh. I was beaten heavily in elementary school, beaten by badminton rackets or the plastic cover for skate blades. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=55.2s)]
*  Honestly, sexual harassment is a problem, but violence is a bigger problem. However, in skating, it's a given that you'd be beaten. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  It would have been considered strange if we had reported it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=73.4s)]
*  What do you want to see happen to the man involved? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=76.4s)]
*  I tried not to blame him, but looking back, I realized I quit skating because of him. He is badmouthing me now while continuing his normal life. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=80.2s)]
*  I want him to suffer as much as I do. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=89.8s)]
*  What do you think of the new coach? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=92.8s)]
*  It all started last year when medallist Shim Soki came forward. She said she had been beaten by her coach. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=103.8s)]
*  Now, Ms. Shim has come forward to say she was sexually abused, and she's not the only one. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=111.4s)]
*  Stars from the world of judo, tennis and football have all come forward to say they too were physically or sexually abused. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=117.0s)]
*  Seoul and South Korea might look glitzy and dynamic, but it remains a patriarchal society. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=125.8s)]
*  It is difficult for women to question, especially men in power, but things are beginning to change. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=131.2s)]
*  The Me Too movement is taking hold, and that is because a brave few women have decided to come forward with their stories. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=139.4s)]
*  It happened over and over again in Korea. People spoke out, it got swept under the rug, and perpetrators acted again. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=148.4s)]
*  Maybe now is the time for a real change. Maybe we can ensure there won't be any more victims. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=155.8s)]
*  There might be other women watching who've suffered like you have. What message would you give them? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  I would like to tell them that we shouldn't think that it is our fault. We should seek help, let others know, and report on it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=168.0s)]
*  Don't suffer alone. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ueqUCMvVU&t=175.6s)]
