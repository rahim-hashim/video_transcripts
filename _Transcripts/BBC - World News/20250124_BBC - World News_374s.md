Video Description: On 29 September 2024, an apartment block in Ain El Delb was struck by Israeli missiles.

The entire six-storey building collapsed, killing 73 people - Lebanonâ€™s deadliest attack in the latest escalation between Israel and Hezbollah.

The Israel Defense Forces said the building was targeted because it was a Hezbollah "terrorist command centre" and it "eliminated" a Hezbollah commander. It added that "the overwhelming majority" of those killed in the strike were "confirmed to be terror operatives".

But a BBC Eye investigation verified the identity of 68 of the 73 people killed in the attack and uncovered evidence suggesting just six were linked to Hezbollah's military wing. None of those identified appeared to hold a senior rank. 

The BBC's World Service also found that the other 62 were civilians - 23 of them children.

# Deadly Israeli attack on Lebanon killed mainly civilians, investigation finds | BBC News

*  Now in Lebanon, Israel's fragile ceasefire agreement with his buller is on a knife edge. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=0.0s)]
*  Both sides had agreed to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon by Monday, but there [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=5.0s)]
*  are fears that deadline won't be met. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=9.36s)]
*  The country is still reeling from last year's intense fighting, including one Israeli strike [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=11.48s)]
*  that destroyed an apartment block and killed 73 people. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=15.92s)]
*  Israel says the building was a terrorist command centre, but a BBC Eye investigation has found [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=19.68s)]
*  most of the victims were civilians. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=24.52s)]
*  Nawal al-Maghafi investigates. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=26.68s)]
*  This is the site of Lebanon's deadliest attack. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=30.36s)]
*  An Israeli airstrike destroyed a residential building in the village of Ayn al-Dalib in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=34.36s)]
*  southern Lebanon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=39.08s)]
*  Once home to more than 100 people, all that remains here are memories of the lives that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=40.84s)]
*  were lost. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=45.88s)]
*  It was the 29th of September. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=46.88s)]
*  Hisham al-Baba went to the building to visit his sister, Denise. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=49.6s)]
*  Shortly after, four more Israeli missiles headed towards the building, causing the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=56.64s)]
*  entire apartment block to collapse, trapping dozens of families under the rubble. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=72.24s)]
*  This video shows the moment that Hisham al-Baba was pulled from the rubble, seven hours later. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=86.64s)]
*  Only to find out he'd lost his sister Denise, her husband and their two children. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=108.16s)]
*  In total, 73 people were killed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  Ayn al-Dalib is a quiet residential neighbourhood. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=119.36s)]
*  Everyone I've spoken to felt safe here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=122.76s)]
*  They even invited family members to seek refuge here after fighting escalated in the south. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=125.08s)]
*  They've also told me that they've never witnessed any Hezbollah military activity. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=131.2s)]
*  So why was this building targeted? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=136.04s)]
*  The Israeli army, the IDF, told us it had eliminated a Hezbollah commander and that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=140.12s)]
*  the building was being used as a terrorist command centre, but didn't provide any evidence [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  to support this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  We investigated their claim and found evidence that six of those killed were connected with [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=153.84s)]
*  Hezbollah's military wing, but none were commanders. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  We sent the IDF their names. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  The IDF didn't tell us if they were the targets of the strike, but said that the overwhelming [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=166.0s)]
*  majority of those killed were confirmed to be terror operatives. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=171.4s)]
*  But our investigation found that at least 60 people killed were civilians. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=176.28s)]
*  23 of them were children. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=181.08s)]
*  And we found that this pattern of striking entire buildings leading to high civilian [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  casualties has been a feature of Israel's war with Hezbollah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=191.52s)]
*  We examined 10 Israeli strikes across Lebanon. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  They killed more than 200 people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=201.08s)]
*  The IDF told us these strikes hit terror infrastructure, command and control centres and Hezbollah [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=204.12s)]
*  operatives. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  In one strike, it said it hit a building where a Hezbollah terrorist was hiding. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  At least 28 people were killed in that attack. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  But the attack in Ayn al-Dalib remains the most deadly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=222.52s)]
*  For now, a fragile ceasefire has held. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  But no one knows how long this relative peace will last. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=232.22s)]
*  Nawal al-Makhafi, BBC News, Southern Lebanon. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=236.84s)]
*  Well, Nawal is with me now here in the studio. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  And Nawal, just tell us why you investigated that particular building. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=244.88s)]
*  Well, Gita, when we first got to Lebanon, a lot of the people we spoke to told us about [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=249.32s)]
*  this building and the fact that 73 people were killed in one residential building. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  We'd also seen other residential buildings coming down in those few weeks. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=258.72s)]
*  And so we decided to delve into this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=264.92s)]
*  At the time, we'd heard from the IDF that they say this is a Hezbollah command centre, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  that the head of the Hezbollah side on compound was killed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=271.64s)]
*  And so we felt like it was really important to take time to do a forensic investigation [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=276.24s)]
*  into exactly who was in the building. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=281.04s)]
*  We went through health ministry records. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=283.24s)]
*  We went through social media, funeral posts, spoke to eyewitnesses to get an idea of who [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=285.2s)]
*  exactly was in the building at the time and why it may have been attacked. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=290.56s)]
*  Now we are expecting this pullback by Monday. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=294.52s)]
*  What are you hearing on the latest for that? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=299.52s)]
*  We're hoping that this pullback will happen because you can see what's at stake here if [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=301.12s)]
*  the ceasefire collapses and fighting resumes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=305.68s)]
*  What we've heard so far is that Israel's Washington ambassador is in conversations with the Trump [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  administration. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=314.08s)]
*  He's asking for an extension. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=315.4s)]
*  They don't want to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  And Hezbollah is threatening that if troops don't withdraw by Monday, that there will [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=321.64s)]
*  be consequences, although it's very hard to see what those consequences will be considering [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=327.12s)]
*  how much they've been weakened in the last couple of months. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=331.36s)]
*  And just finally, I mean, obviously, Lebanon has been politically in a very, very fragile [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=334.8s)]
*  state for a long time. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=340.36s)]
*  What was your sense after this trip talking to people after this latest incredibly difficult [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=342.68s)]
*  period? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=347.0s)]
*  I mean, what's really devastating about Lebanon is that this isn't the first confrontation [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=348.0s)]
*  between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=351.36s)]
*  It's one of many. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=354.68s)]
*  And what it felt like was that, yes, Hezbollah has been weakened now, but it hasn't been [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  demolished altogether. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=361.32s)]
*  And it seems like this isn't the last confrontation we'll see between them in the coming years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=362.68s)]
*  So it's a very sad situation. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=369.16s)]
*  Noelle, I'll look out for you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=371.04s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed for coming in. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckssccx0JqA&t=372.48s)]
