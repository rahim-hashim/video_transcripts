*  Let's start with those breaking developments in Austria because Austria has declared three [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=0.0s)]
*  days of national mourning after a mass shooting at a secondary school in the city of Graz. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=4.84s)]
*  The victims are six females and three males. Twelve other people were also injured. The [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=10.84s)]
*  suspect, a 21-year-old Austrian man, is also dead. He's believed to have killed himself. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Well Graz is Austria's second largest city and is located about 200 kilometres from the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=24.04s)]
*  capital Vienna. Well just in the last few minutes a number of officials including the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=29.08s)]
*  Chancellor of Austria has been giving the latest details to the media. Here's a little [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=34.6s)]
*  of what he's been saying. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=39.56s)]
*  My deepest condolences to the families, the parents who have lost a child today. My thoughts [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  are with the siblings who now have to live without their brother or their sister. My [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=51.12s)]
*  compassion to those who have been injured and suffered unimaginable, an unimaginable [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=58.72s)]
*  loss today. To the teachers, the friends, the staff in the school which have had to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=71.0s)]
*  experience and witness this incredible heinous crime. As parents, as humans, as society, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=78.24s)]
*  in this country we are all affected by this incidence. A school is more than just a place [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=87.52s)]
*  to learn. It is a space for trust, for feeling comfortable and for having a future. It is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=98.32s)]
*  a safe space and should be a safe space and this safe space has been violated which makes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=106.08s)]
*  us feel powerless. In moments like this we have to show unity. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=113.48s)]
*  Well that from the news conference. Just a short while ago let's go straight to Graz. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=118.16s)]
*  Bethany Bell, our correspondent is there and Bethany just about every single detail that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=121.92s)]
*  we've been learning is absolutely horrific here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=126.84s)]
*  Several details emerging over the last hour or so. We now know that the police suspect [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=133.08s)]
*  that the shooter was a 21 year old former student of the school which you can see just [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  behind me there. It's been now cordoned off by police. He is understood not to have completed [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  his studies at the school. The authorities say he was an Austrian citizen. He came from [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=153.4s)]
*  the area around Graz. The police said that they were alerted to an incident at the school [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=161.6s)]
*  at 10 o'clock local time this morning. They were there very quickly and were able within [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=168.68s)]
*  ten minutes, in 17 minutes or so to secure the area. They say that the suspected shooter [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=173.76s)]
*  is understood to have killed himself in a bathroom. He said to have had two guns which [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=181.92s)]
*  he used, both of which he owned legally. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=190.42s)]
*  Bethany what else are the authorities saying about the many people who are also injured [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  here? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=200.66s)]
*  Many people injured and many being treated in local hospitals around here in Graz. We [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  know that there are nine people who died, six of them female, three of them male in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=212.3s)]
*  the words of the officials here. There have been distressing scenes we understand. The [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=220.46s)]
*  school was evacuated very quickly. Students were taken to a hall where they were given [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=228.5s)]
*  care and then they were taken to another place where they were reunited with their parents [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  and those who are in hospital are being treated at the moment. We understand that there are [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=241.54s)]
*  people who are severely injured. Some reports, unconfirmed at the moment, suggest that a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=248.54s)]
*  number of those who were injured had injuries to their legs. The shooter appears to have [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  shot them in the legs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=260.14s)]
*  Bethany it is a night mesh scenario for all of those parents rushing to the school to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=262.5s)]
*  actually find out what has happened to their loved ones. So there is all of that trauma [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=268.46s)]
*  to deal with, let alone those pupils who survived. What is the state of play with Austria's gun [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  laws? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=281.3s)]
*  This is by far the worst mass shooting in Austria's recent history. There have been [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=286.98s)]
*  individual incidences of people shooting at schools since the 1990s but nothing like [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=292.7s)]
*  the casualties that we are seeing in this particular case. Austria's gun laws are liberal [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=299.97999999999996s)]
*  compared to some European countries and according to some estimates the level of gun ownership [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=307.78s)]
*  here is quite high. We are told that in this case the suspected shooter did own these [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=314.78s)]
*  two weapons legally. So I think many questions will be asked of course about the state of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  Austria's gun laws but certainly in recent years Austria has been spared the kind of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=332.26s)]
*  mass shootings that other European countries have seen. The worst incident in recent years [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=338.02s)]
*  was in 2020 when a known jihadist ran through Vienna and in that case four people were killed. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=343.68s)]
*  Bethany Bell, there in Graz, thanks very much for the latest. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f-F6xbqilM&t=351.88s)]
