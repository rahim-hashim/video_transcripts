# Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan jailed for 14 years in corruption case | BBCNews
**BBC - World News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA)
*  Now let's take you to Pakistan and the country's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has been sentenced to 14 years in jail. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=0.0s)]
*  In a corruption case he's also been fined. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=7.0s)]
*  Well his wife was sentenced to seven years and also given a fine. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=10.0s)]
*  Mr Khan's been in jail since August of 2023 and has called all charges against him politically motivated. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=13.0s)]
*  Well for more on this let's go live to Islamabad and join our Pakistan correspondent Azadeh Mishiri. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=20.0s)]
*  Azadeh there's been a number of cases against Mr Khan. Just bring us up to date on this particular one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=27.0s)]
*  Well Rajini they were indicted nearly a year ago now back in February and that was shortly after the national elections here in Pakistan. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=35.0s)]
*  And this verdict has actually been postponed three times but we do now have a sentence. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=42.0s)]
*  Now prosecutors had alleged that hundreds of hectares worth of land had been donated to the Al Qadeer Trust. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=47.0s)]
*  An organisation that only had two main trustees Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=54.0s)]
*  And now the court has found in favour of the main allegation that this was a bribe. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=60.0s)]
*  In return Imran Khan has been found to have assisted a business tycoon here in Pakistan Malik Riaz in settling a fine that his company had in front of the Supreme Court. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=65.0s)]
*  Now Mr Khan's lawyer has insisted that not a single penny has gone into the pockets of the accused. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=78.0s)]
*  And of course Mr Khan as you mentioned has said that all charges against him have been politically, are politically motivated. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=86.0s)]
*  The backdrop to all of this are talks between Imran Khan's party, the PTI party and the government. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=94.0s)]
*  And the main demand that his party has is that they release Imran Khan and anyone else that they are calling political prisoners. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=100.0s)]
*  Of course today this sentence is 14 years for Imran Khan as well as a fine and seven years for Bushra Bibi. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=109.0s)]
*  So of course it is a setback if he was hoping for some form of early release. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=116.0s)]
*  And now today of course as we mentioned just then there's a number of cases still pending against Mr Khan who is still in jail. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=120.0s)]
*  Just remind us of the wider context of all of this. What are those cases? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=128.0s)]
*  Yes, the former Prime Minister has been in jail since August 2023 and several of his sentences, many of them have been suspended. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=134.0s)]
*  A UN working group did find that he'd been arbitrarily detained. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=144.0s)]
*  But when it comes to this case, the Al Qaeda Trust case which is related to his initial arrest, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=150.0s)]
*  the court has obviously found him guilty of corruption charges and has found his wife Bushra Bibi guilty of assisting, aiding and abetting in those corruption charges. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=155.0s)]
*  And so in terms of his jail sentence, he now has this jail sentence of 14 years. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=166.0s)]
*  And there is a power struggle right now in the country between his party, the PTI party and the government. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=172.0s)]
*  So of course as their talks are ongoing, they've entered another round of talks. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=179.0s)]
*  We still don't have the results of those yet. This is what they're calling for. They're calling for Imran Khan's release. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=184.0s)]
*  And in reaction to this decision, we have had the chairman of the PTI party say that he believes Imran Khan will be released soon [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=190.0s)]
*  and that this isn't something that he's going to be giving into, that he won't be beaten by this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=200.0s)]
*  And so of course it's something that's gripping the country, gripping the headlines and everyone here is following it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=205.0s)]
*  That's the day, Ms. Sharia, correspondent in Pakistan. Thank you very much. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FtvR-XpwoA&t=211.0s)]
