Video Description: UK opposition politicians have accused US vice-president JD Vance of disrespecting British forces after he said a US stake in Ukraine's economy was a "better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years".
 
More than 150,000 British personnel served in Afghanistan alongside US troops, with France also sending forces to the country. The UK was also part of a US-led invasion of Iraq.
 
Vance has since insisted he did not "even mention the UK or France", adding that both had "fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond".

# JD Vance denies disrespecting UK over ‘random country’ remarks | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg)
*  Here in the UK, Downing Street says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer spoke to President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump last night before his decision to halt aid. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=5.2s)]
*  The government here insists it is laser-focused on securing a lasting peace for Ukraine and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=9.1s)]
*  wouldn't be derailed from those efforts. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=14.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, the US Vice President JD Vance has denied disrespecting British forces in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=16.52s)]
*  comments he made in a Fox News interview. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=21.92s)]
*  Vicky Young has the reaction from Westminster. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=24.76s)]
*  Memorating the special relationship in a different era, a British Prime Minister and an American [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=29.2s)]
*  President side by side. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=34.56s)]
*  Roosevelt and Churchill were allies in a war effort against a common enemy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=36.8s)]
*  Eighty years later, Keir Starmer says he has a good relationship with President Trump, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=43.08s)]
*  but influencing his decisions is proving difficult. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=47.8s)]
*  What's your message to the Ukrainian front lines? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=50.92s)]
*  Ministers woked the news that the US had withdrawn military aid from Ukraine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=53.84s)]
*  Is this the moment Europe has to go it alone on defence, Minister? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=58.16s)]
*  This was the government's carefully worded response. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=61.48s)]
*  What the US government decides to do, that's entirely their decision, but the UK and the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=64.2s)]
*  Prime Minister is very clear on our support for Ukraine and that we need that peace deal. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=69.28s)]
*  And the President Trump has said that we need a peace deal as well and we're focused on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=74.24s)]
*  making sure we get that over the line. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=78.08s)]
*  The Conservative leader was more critical. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  It was an incredibly disappointing development. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=83.44s)]
*  I think it sends a signal to Vladimir Putin that he is winning and we need to remember [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=86.64s)]
*  who it is, whose side we're on, that is President Zelensky's. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  We're not on the side of Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=96.44s)]
*  I believe that President Zelensky needs all the help he can get and that does include [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  American military aid. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=102.8s)]
*  Downing Street say the Prime Minister's been in daily contact with President Trump recently, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  but they won't say whether he knew in advance about the announcement on US military aid [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  It shows the difficulties of dealing with this unpredictable American administration. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=116.52s)]
*  The Vice President, JD Vance, has caused offence with his comments about a potential European [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=122.32s)]
*  peacekeeping force in Ukraine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=127.92s)]
*  The very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=130.32s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=136.0s)]
*  That is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=137.0s)]
*  hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=142.56s)]
*  He insisted later that he wasn't referring to British troops, but it's angered some [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=145.76s)]
*  in Westminster. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=150.06s)]
*  It's quite clear who his comments were referring to. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=151.06s)]
*  I think it's deeply disrespectful to all those who served in the British Armed Forces, including [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  myself and to those who are serving currently. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=158.0s)]
*  And I think veterans across this country today will just feel very upset with those comments [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=160.44s)]
*  that he has made. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=165.89999999999998s)]
*  The Prime Minister is keeping up the diplomatic activity. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=167.76s)]
*  He spoke to President Zelensky again today and welcomed his latest commitment to securing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=170.96s)]
*  peace. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  Vicky Young, BBC News, Westminster. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvA7w6kjzKg&t=176.92000000000002s)]
