Video Description: Donald Trump's "explosive" tariffs are now in effect, including 104% on China, the world's biggest exporter.

Also on the list are 60 of the "worst offending" countries - who will face tariffs ranging from 11% - 50%.

The additional tariffs on China kicked in after Beijing refused to meet Trump's deadline to withdraw its own retaliatory levies on the US.

Trump has said that the tariffs are vital for his economic vision, but experts warn a full scale trade war is a possibility.

*  bespoke deals with countries. So that whole situation that you know there was [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  it was somewhat explosive but if we didn't do that we wouldn't be talking [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=79.28s)]
*  the way we're talking right now. It's been amazing what's happened. Sometimes [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=84.12s)]
*  you have to mix it up a little bit but we've had great great consideration. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=87.72s)]
*  We've had talks with many many countries over 70 they all want to come in. Our [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=92.56s)]

*  know the tariffs are on and the money is pouring in at a level that we've never [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=104.84s)]

*  Jonathan Head in Bangkok, Amarika Oye in Singapore but first to Washington and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=115.84s)]
*  our North America correspondent Peter Bose. So Peter the tariffs are now in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  place the reciprocal tariffs. It was hoped I'm sure on the part of many [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=126.16s)]
*  countries that deals could have been done before this moment. Yes really we're [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  seeing now the full force of those tariffs that it's now a week since Donald [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=137.6s)]
*  Trump first announced his plans. The full force of those tariffs around the world [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=142.16s)]
*  with individual countries the worst offenders as the White House has [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=146.72s)]
*  described them now feeling the weight of those tariffs and well you've mentioned [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=151.0s)]
*  China that 104% tariff that's as a result of China not pulling back on its [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=155.44s)]
*  tariffs against the United States in terms of products going to the US and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=162.44s)]
*  really this is what Donald Trump wanted he's described it as explosive he says [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=168.04s)]
*  you have to shake it up a little bit that might be a little bit of an [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=174.52s)]
*  understatement when you gauge the reaction internationally and increasingly [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=177.28s)]
*  Sally the reaction in this country we're seeing people concerned about everyday [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=181.84s)]
*  products like food like clothing some people are beginning to stockpile those [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=186.36s)]
*  goods in their homes while they can before they expect the prices to rise in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=191.92s)]
*  the next few days and and quite incredible to see the swift movements on [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=197.16s)]
*  Wall Street in in every direction up and down as as traders can't take their eyes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=202.88s)]
*  off the screen and you know truth social and other places where Donald Trump is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=209.16s)]
*  adding more detail. Yeah and I think uncertainty is the word because we're [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  seeing those wild fluctuations in Wall Street that often just swing on a few [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=220.2s)]
*  words from the White House or indeed rumors that maybe actually turn out to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=226.2s)]
*  be wrong but still affect the market so I think strong and so significant are [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  the jitters that the people are feeling at the moment that it doesn't take much [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  to make you know quite significant changes in terms of prices and the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=239.56s)]
*  sell-off that we've been seeing. Okay Peter thank you so much indeed let's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=244.72s)]
*  talk to Shima Kaleel now who joins us from Tokyo. Shima 24% tariffs for Japan [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=248.52s)]
*  an ally of the US a very important trading partner so many goods head to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  the United States and it's hoped that Japan could be first in the queue for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=262.8s)]
*  negotiations. Yes Japan will get priority tariff negotiations according to the US [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=267.12s)]
*  Secretary Treasury Secretary but what that will look like how that will turn [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=273.8s)]
*  out nobody really knows it's still in that uncertain realm as Peter was was [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=278.36s)]
*  speaking there but I think look there's so many stats and numbers that you can [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=283.32s)]
*  throw at this story but I think here in Tokyo the sentiment is still one of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=288.36s)]
*  being stunned of being shocked as you say Sally Tokyo is a staunch ally in the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=293.64s)]
*  region a key economic and security ally of the United States and unlike Beijing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=299.28s)]
*  this is a friendly relationship Tokyo is a friend Beijing is a foe and yet Japan [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=305.11999999999995s)]
*  feels that it has to swallow the bitter pill of the reciprocal tariffs and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=310.4s)]
*  there's almost a sentiment of how could you do this to us that politically [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  you can you can feel it in the air the Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=320.84s)]
*  whole country has to come together in what he described as a national crisis [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=324.08s)]
*  there is that governmental task force now with thousands of consulting desks and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=328.44s)]
*  financial institutions fielding calls regarding tariffs but even though the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=333.84s)]
*  Prime Minister has called for diplomatic composure the fact that Tokyo is still [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=339.4s)]
*  very much in tandem with its relationship and committed to the US [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=344.52s)]
*  economy with the 25% levy on the car industry already in place the danger is [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=349.4s)]
*  real the auto industry represents 20% of Japan's exports that's 17 billion [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  dollars of projected losses if these levies are still in place the tariff [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=363.48s)]
*  diplomacy is in full force there are two major developments in the chaos of the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=369.76s)]
*  last few days one is that 30 minute phone call between the Prime Minister [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=373.0s)]
*  and Donald Trump on Monday and that tells you that there is an open channel [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=377.04s)]
*  and the second one is the appointment of the economy economic minister Ryosei [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Akazawa as the chief tariff negotiator he will be dealing with the US Treasury [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=386.12s)]

*  military personnel here there there's already developing defense agreements [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=402.92s)]
*  between the US and Japan and so the negotiators have a lot to talk about [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=409.2s)]
*  with the United States they will get as you say a front seat but it's still a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  very uphill battle priority boarding as they say when you're getting on a plane [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=420.0s)]
*  thank you Shima let's go to Jonathan Head in Bangkok so Jonathan Thailand is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=424.40000000000003s)]

*  come into effect in the last few minutes and I have seen the Thai markets being [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=434.68s)]
*  hit hard by all of this as well as they are across the region Sally I mean the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=439.0s)]
*  worst affected country or the least terms of the terms of the actual scale [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=444.08s)]
*  of the tariffs in is little Cambodia 49% I mean there is simply no hope that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=447.68s)]
*  Cambodia can buy as much from the US as it sells that's going to have a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=452.88s)]
*  devastating effect on its garment industry like other countries in this [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  region the response from Cambodia from Vietnam as well Vietnam US exports to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=461.12s)]
*  the United States it's the largest destination account for 23% of its entire [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=466.52s)]
*  GDP and Vietnam has very ambitious growth targets for its current economic [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=471.2s)]
*  plans for Thailand it's a bit less about 18% of exports go to the US but Thailand [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=476.4s)]
*  has a flatlining economy and is desperately looking for all possible [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=482.36s)]
*  ways of getting it going these tariffs have come at the worst possible moment [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=486.24s)]
*  now the official response from all the governments in this region is don't [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=490.08s)]
*  panic don't retaliate as China has done negotiate but negotiations I mean [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=495.32s)]
*  you heard from China Japan's at the top of the head of the line other [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=501.08000000000004s)]
*  Thailand's gonna set its finance minister the Vietnamese deputy prime [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=505.04s)]
*  ministers on his way the Malaysian leader Anwar Ibrahim is heading to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=508.56s)]
*  Washington to I mean who will they meet and we heard from mr. Trump's trade [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=512.52s)]
*  counselor Peter Navarro in interviews given over the last 24 hours but even [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=519.88s)]
*  though these countries have all offered to reduce their tariffs Vietnam said [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=524.84s)]
*  we'll bring our tariffs down to zero he said that won't matter he said the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=528.52s)]
*  fundamental problem is the imbalance in trade and because these tariffs have [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=532.12s)]
*  been calculated not on the basis of what tariffs are imposed on the US but on how [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=536.04s)]
*  big the trade deficit is all of Southeast Asia pretty much has a trade [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=541.2s)]
*  surplus with the US because these are relatively low-income high exporting [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=545.2s)]
*  countries that's their model they simply cannot buy as much from the US as they [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=550.2s)]
*  export and so it doesn't look at the moment if mr. Navarro's influence still [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=554.42s)]
*  holds and so whether it's actually going to be possible for that for that trade [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=559.02s)]
*  those trade negotiations to actually be able to be successful and Jonathan you [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=563.9799999999999s)]
*  mentioned Cambodia and Vietnam as well in particular and I noticed a lot of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=568.38s)]
*  their governments are saying we're gonna buy more US goods we're looking to see [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=572.74s)]
*  what we can purchase from the US to try and reduce the deficit but actually [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=576.38s)]
*  Vietnam Cambodia in particular really benefited from the tariffs that Trump [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=581.58s)]
*  put in place in his first term in office back in 2016 because all the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=586.74s)]
*  manufacturing was moving out of China to other parts of Southeast Asia and later [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=590.82s)]
*  in this program I'll be talking to a company boss who's in Arkansas who has [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=595.3000000000001s)]
*  all these goods made in Vietnam and still those tariffs are much lower than [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=598.98s)]
*  China aren't they so you're still better off getting things made in Vietnam than [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=603.46s)]
*  China yeah but obviously that it's all a question of you if you're hit with [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=607.98s)]
*  tariffs are you gonna be worse off than your competitor and I think that's where [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=612.0600000000001s)]
*  look Southeast Asian countries are inherently transactional and they are [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=615.86s)]
*  being pragmatic even though inwardly I think they'll be panicking there are [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=619.62s)]
*  going to be big impacts on their on the people's standards of living I mean [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=623.1s)]
*  Peter Navarro claimed that one-third of US of Vietnamese exports the US are [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=626.78s)]
*  actually de facto think products but diverted into Vietnam from China that's [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=632.6600000000001s)]

*  many for supply chains for manufacturers where are they going to go next you know [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=656.5s)]

*  somewhere else it's the unpredictability of course and the very peculiar nature [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=663.78s)]
*  of these tariffs that the Trump administration has come up with which [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=668.1s)]
*  makes it so hard for governments and manufacturers to decide what their [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=671.58s)]
*  long-term plans should be now okay Jonathan thank you very much well let's [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=675.4200000000001s)]

*  watching the stock market reaction since Thursday last week ever since mr. Trump [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=691.9s)]
*  announced those latest tariffs in what the wash White House calls on liberation [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=696.22s)]
*  day and on Thursday and Friday we saw that sell-off and then on Monday we saw [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=700.6999999999999s)]
*  a much bigger sharp sell-off especially in Japan and Hong Kong yesterday we saw [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=705.26s)]
*  a bit of a recovery but then once again we are back in the red so basically [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=711.0s)]
*  investors are not liking everything that they're hearing in terms of that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=716.1s)]
*  escalating tension between the United States and China as Shima and Jonathan [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=719.78s)]

*  Washington but so far no one has been successful in winning an exemption or [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=728.7s)]
*  getting a deal and that's why we're seeing this sell-off investors and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=733.7s)]
*  economists have been warning about these tariffs pushing up prices in the United [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=738.3000000000001s)]
*  States and possibly pushing the US and even a global economy into a recession [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=742.72s)]

*  all these countries 60 countries digesting brand-new tariffs let's now [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=763.88s)]
*  focus on China I'm joined by Han Lin who is China country director of the Asia [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=768.22s)]
*  Group welcome to BBC News a hundred and four percent is the tariffs now on [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=774.38s)]
*  Chinese goods headed to the United States what's your thoughts on that yeah [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=781.34s)]
*  that these tariffs are quite frustrating for the Chinese government not that [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=786.38s)]
*  China has feels unprepared but that the US-China trade situation has unraveled [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=789.98s)]
*  so quickly without a clear off-ramp or a channel of communication besides China [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=795.66s)]
*  capitulating which is not likely going to happen but but certainly one thing [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=801.78s)]
*  that's being watched as carefully as this is that I remember late last [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=806.14s)]
*  quarter China had announced that if there was a trade war China would [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=810.62s)]
*  respond firmly it has a more diverse and deeper toolkit to retaliate with and [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=814.86s)]
*  that China has a greater capacity to endure or suffer pain so it looks like [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=820.18s)]
*  this thesis is about to be challenged over the coming weeks and months but [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=825.14s)]
*  certainly one thing we do know which is this if China can't export its way to [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=829.06s)]
*  GDP growth it's going to focus more on the domestic economy and when you look [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=833.46s)]
*  at China's sinking stock market there's a lot more pressure to accelerate the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=837.6999999999999s)]
*  fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been announced earlier but but that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=842.8199999999999s)]
*  pivot from being the factory of the world to looking at economic growth [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=847.22s)]
*  fueled by domestic demand is not an easy transition and actually it's something [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=854.14s)]
*  China's been trying to do for a few years now really since the global [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=858.78s)]
*  pandemic so how will it make that shift I mean I'm looking at Goldman Sachs [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=863.06s)]
*  who's now saying the impact on the Chinese economy could be something like [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=867.9799999999999s)]
*  four and a half percent this year of a reduction in GDP growth that is a [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=872.02s)]
*  challenge China is trying to deal with because it looks like at least based on [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=878.78s)]
*  the recent purchasing managers index data for March the economy looks like [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=883.86s)]
*  it's stabilizing and that there is still a lot of potential for aggregate demand [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=888.46s)]
*  growth and that things and stimulus such as cutting rates still have yet to [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=894.34s)]
*  happen so there are still potential but that is true China has stuck to its 5% [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=899.26s)]
*  growth target this year that was certainly announced during the recent [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=905.26s)]
*  and how likely is going to meet that 5% growth target in a way that people feel [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=910.02s)]
*  safe and comfortable going forward that is still very much an open question okay [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=915.38s)]
*  Han Lin from the Asia group thank you for giving us your take on the [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=920.14s)]
*  challenges facing China well let's now talk to someone who is glued to the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=925.02s)]
*  screens a trader who an investor Dan Ives who's the global head of tech [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=931.78s)]
*  research at Wed Bush securities Dan how are you doing I mean look I tell you [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=936.7s)]
*  25 years doing this your dot-com bubble burst financial crisis COVID I think [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=943.82s)]
*  this is probably the scariest days that I've seen in my career I must admit Dan [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=951.0200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to agree with you on that because I've been working in [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=957.6600000000001s)]
*  financial journalism as long as you have I remember the dot-com bubble bursting [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=961.3000000000001s)]
*  at the end of the 90s as you say the financial crisis to 2008 COVID this feels more intense [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=965.42s)]
*  and the gyrations are much more severe so why is that because you don't know the rules of the game [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=972.9399999999999s)]
*  and ultimately these are things where when you talk about turning around you know once this [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=979.78s)]
*  snowball starts going downhill you can't stop it and I believe as these go into effect a [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=988.02s)]
*  recession is almost guaranteed in the US and I think this is it's an economic Armageddon that's [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=995.06s)]
*  self-inflicted in my opinion it's the worst policy move out of the White House in a hundred years [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1001.9799999999999s)]
*  so you are not on board then with the president who says okay I know this is explosive I know [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1008.54s)]
*  this is painful but in the long term America will be the winner we are making America great again [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1015.7399999999999s)]

*  it's telling in news reality and in news math and that's why stocks are selling off and that's why [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1043.18s)]
*  this is gonna go down in history unfortunately it's gonna be a dark chapter and I just believe [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1050.98s)]
*  the pressure is gonna continue to mount in DC on Wall Street then negotiations are gonna [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1056.54s)]
*  start because this cannot be at this level it continues to be an absurd situation and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1063.78s)]
*  unfortunately it's consumers that are gonna be paying for it and Dan you've been over the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1070.08s)]
*  years that I've spoken to you extremely bullish on on Tesla also Apple as well which has been the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1074.82s)]
*  darling of the market and seen as a solid stock and yet obviously Apple is so exposed to all of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1080.98s)]
*  this what's your take on those kind of companies that have been massively sold off and in and [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1086.6599999999999s)]
*  Tesla in particular and Elon Musk and his role in all of this not that he's involved with tariffs [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1091.54s)]
*  specifically but of course his alignment with President Trump look I think no industry is [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyePX5x2Pw&t=1097.86s)]
