Video Description: Ukraine's military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has said that Russia has launched a new offensive on the northeast of the country, adding that a large increase in assaults was already being observed. 
 
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had warned earlier that Russia was preparing an offensive on the two regions of Kharkiv and Sumy.
 
Moscow is close to fully pushing Ukrainian forces out of their foothold in Kursk region, which they held since last August and which lies over the border from Sumy region. 
 
Zelenskiy said on Monday that Ukrainian forces were also present in the adjacent Russian region of Belgorod.

**BBC - World News:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY)
*  Hello, welcome back. The commander of Ukraine's armed forces says that Russia has begun a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=0.0s)]
*  spring offensive in the northeast. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=5.44s)]
*  Aleksandr Siresky's comments came as President Zelensky told reporters that Russia was preparing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=7.94s)]
*  for a new push in the Kharkiv and Sumi regions. Earlier, the Russian army said it had captured [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  the village of Zhuravka, just inside the Ukrainian border in the Sumi region. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=19.68s)]
*  And Kiev has said it is carrying out offensive operations in Russia's Belgorod Oblast in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=24.92s)]
*  order to try and disrupt Russia's offensive. All of this is happening as around 30 defence [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=30.360000000000003s)]
*  ministers are meeting in Brussels to continue efforts to end the war in Ukraine. The gathering [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=35.72s)]
*  was convened by Britain and France, two nations who've said that they'd contribute to any [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  peacekeeping force in the event of a truce. The UK defence secretary John Healy opened [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=46.92s)]
*  that meeting. Let's have a listen. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=52.18000000000001s)]
*  There are 30 countries here today, 30 countries bound by a simple belief that peace is possible [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=54.48s)]
*  and we must be ready for when that peace comes. That's why the work of this coalition is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=64.12s)]
*  so vital. We're stepping up, we're serious, we're sending a signal to President Putin [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=71.28s)]
*  and to Minister Umarov and the Ukrainian people. We stand with you in the fight and we will [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=81.48s)]
*  stand with you in the peace. Well, our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=88.54s)]
*  outlined what Ukrainian officials are saying about a new Russian offensive. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=93.12s)]
*  Well, there is concern that Russia is thought to be gathering tens of thousands of troops [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=98.04s)]
*  in its western Kursk region, where it is thought that they may well, with the arrival of spring, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=104.62s)]
*  although you wouldn't know it at the moment, when the ground hardens, that Russia will [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=111.36s)]
*  look to capitalise on these improved conditions and mount another major offensive in eastern [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=115.72s)]
*  and northeastern Ukraine. As of now, these troops are simply gathering, but according [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=120.88s)]
*  to Ukraine's head of the armed forces, Oleg Zanderskij, Russia has already started its [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=126.12s)]
*  spring offensives. He is seeing an increased number of assaults right across the eastern [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=131.46s)]
*  parts of the front line. And if you're Ukraine, this is what you are trying to point out to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=138.24s)]
*  America that whilst Washington continues to try and spearhead these peace efforts, these [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=143.4s)]
*  negotiations, Ukraine is going to point to this continued flurry of military activity [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=149.4s)]
*  by Russia as it looks to pursue its objective, which Kiev says has not changed, which is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  taking as much of Ukraine as possible. James Waterhouse in Kiev. Now Russia and the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  US have again swapped prisoners. Ksenia Karolina, a Russian-American dancer who was jailed by [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=167.08s)]
*  a Moscow court for donating to a Ukrainian charity, is on her way back to the US. In [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  return, the Americans have released a Russian-German national, Arthur Petrov. The prisoner swap [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  took place in Abu Dhabi early on Thursday. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg has this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=184.84s)]
*  update. So what do we know? This prisoner swap, two people are involved, so the Russians [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  have released Ksenia Karolina, who is a Russia-US dual national. She's a resident of Los Angeles, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=196.56s)]
*  an amateur ballerina. Last year she came back to Russia to visit her family. She was arrested. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=205.24s)]
*  She was convicted of treason, her crime being that she donated around $50 to a US-based [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=211.62s)]
*  charity that supports Ukraine. She was sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony. So she's been [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=219.0s)]
*  freed. The Russians have freed a Russian-German dual national, Arthur Petrov. He was arrested [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=225.08s)]
*  on Cyprus in 2023 at the request of the Americans. He was extradited to America. He was accused [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=233.36s)]
*  of conspiring to ship sensitive US microelectronics to Russia. So he's been freed by the Americans. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=240.36s)]
*  I think this adds to the desire by both Moscow and Washington to kind of boost relations, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=247.36s)]
*  improve the atmosphere between Russia and America. There are talks going on today in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=260.32s)]
*  Istanbul, diplomatic talks about improving the functioning of diplomatic missions, Russian [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=264.64s)]
*  and American. So you can see where this is leading. Even though there's been very little [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  progress in terms of ending the war in Ukraine, US and Russia, I think, are determined to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=276.72s)]
*  do what they can to improve their bilateral relations right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR99McBIEVY&t=283.04s)]
