Video Description: Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI - the maker of ChatGPT - has rebuffed a $97.4bn (Â£78.4bn) take over bid from a consortium of investors led by Elon Musk.
 
Musk's attorney, Marc Toberoff, confirmed he submitted the bid for all OpenAI's assets to its board on Monday.
 
The offer is the latest twist in a longstanding battle between Musk, the world's richest person and right-hand man to US President Donald Trump, and Open AI chief executive Sam Altman over the future of the start-up at the centre of the AI boom.
 
In response to the bid, Altman posted on Musk's social media platform X, "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want".

# ChatGPT boss rejects Elon Musk-led investors' $97bn bid | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew)
*  Now to a bit of rivalry in the world of tech because the boss of chat GPT maker OpenAI, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=0.0s)]
*  Sam Altman, has shot down a $97 billion offer by Elon Musk to buy the company. He posted [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=5.24s)]
*  on X, no thank you, but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want. Well, he also [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  told staff and a message to the company's board that they will make it clear it has [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=19.2s)]
*  no interest in Elon Musk's supposed bid. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=23.2s)]
*  Jonny Penn is an author and associate teaching professor on AI ethics at Cambridge University [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=27.16s)]
*  and I asked him what he made of the online exchange between Elon Musk and Sam Altman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=31.6s)]
*  What Musk is trying to do here is raise the value, the perceived value of the non-profit [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=37.2s)]
*  arm of OpenAI so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=42.56s)]
*  own non-profit. It's a little complex, but he's basically trying to stymie OpenAI's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=48.06s)]
*  growth trajectory and the investors that are behind Musk's play are many of the same investors [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  in AI in X.AI which is Musk's AI company. So, you know, it's a long-standing rivalry [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=61.8s)]
*  between these two, but Musk is I think only semi-serious in that he wants to kind of slow [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=68.44s)]
*  OpenAI down so that his own business. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=73.72s)]
*  It does raise though a reminder that there are a few individuals still in the US tech [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=76.64s)]
*  world with enormous power and we've seen Elon Musk obviously wield that right now in the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=84.04s)]
*  political world too. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=88.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm, you know, it's a particular type of power. I'd like to think of value and power [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=91.12s)]
*  as one and the same in the business world in the long run and I think there's a lot [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=99.52s)]
*  of hype around these technologies and so the perceived power versus the actual power, we'll [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=103.18s)]
*  have to wait and see which of these two gentlemen actually has something to offer the world [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=107.92s)]
*  in the long run. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  And this all comes of course as we've seen this huge AI conference in Paris. The US and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  the UK have not signed an agreement on that summit. It was signed by France, China, India [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  amongst many others pledging open, inclusive and ethical approaches to AI. Why do you think [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=128.24s)]
*  the US and the UK have not signed it? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=133.84s)]
*  US case is primarily because they're kind of scaremongering about the threats of ideology [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=137.84s)]
*  and JD Vance has just been on stage saying the Americans want an ideology free AI. It's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=145.84s)]
*  a nice idea, but it's not possible. That's not how knowledge works. Knowledge contains [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=153.84s)]
*  ideology. AI is a kind of scaled up version of knowledge transfer. It's going to have [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=158.84s)]
*  ideological components and we should approach it that way. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=164.84s)]
*  Jonny Penn there from Cambridge University. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv8NFsGjpew&t=167.84s)]
