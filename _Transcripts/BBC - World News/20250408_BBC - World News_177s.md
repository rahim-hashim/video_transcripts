**BBC - World News:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k)
*  Well here in Washington Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Donald Trump to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=0.0s)]
*  discuss 17 percent tariffs on Israel as well as a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  He is now the first foreign leader to visit the White House since the US President announced [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=10.68s)]
*  a slate of new tariffs last Wednesday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=15.0s)]
*  Well the two leaders said that they discussed relations in Syria, Iran nuclear development, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=17.2s)]
*  hostage negotiations in Gaza as well as trade with Mr. Netanyahu vowing to eliminate Israel's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  trade deficit with the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=29.48s)]
*  I said to the President a very simple thing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=35.64s)]
*  We intend to do it very quickly. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=39.84s)]
*  We think it's the right thing to do and we're going to also eliminate trade barriers, a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=41.92s)]
*  variety of trade barriers that have been put up unnecessarily and I think Israel can serve [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=47.96s)]
*  as a model for many countries who ought to do the same. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=52.2s)]
*  We also heard mention of Iran, the news that direct talks are being held between Tehran [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=58.48s)]
*  and Washington. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=64.08s)]
*  What more do we know about that? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=65.08s)]
*  That was a surprise. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=67.64s)]
*  Just last month Donald Trump had said that he didn't see the need or the productivity [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=69.36s)]
*  of direct talks. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=74.08s)]
*  Now he's saying that there are direct talks and only direct talks but talks at almost [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=75.2s)]
*  the highest levels. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=80.0s)]
*  He said that there was going to be a very big meeting this weekend. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=81.44s)]
*  He also reiterated that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapons program, cannot acquire [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=85.96s)]
*  nuclear weapons and that there would be great danger to Iran if there is no deal. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu actually added that Iran and these talks were the subject of the largest amount [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=97.08s)]
*  of conversation during their closed-door meeting today at the White House. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=103.96s)]
*  Of course the issue that continues to loom large, the war in Gaza, the question of moving [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians out of Gaza that we saw raised during Netanyahu's first visit. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  It did come up once again as did efforts to get hostages home. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  That did come up once again and both Netanyahu and Trump said that there were countries that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=124.2s)]
*  would be willing to take Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=128.8s)]
*  They didn't go into exactly detail. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=132.36s)]
*  Which countries? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=134.44s)]
*  Donald Trump reiterated that he wanted to turn Gaza into a freedom zone. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=136.16s)]
*  He said he didn't understand why Israel gave up Gaza to begin with. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=142.2s)]
*  Maybe they were hoping for peace but they didn't give it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=146.48s)]
*  Netanyahu said he just wanted to give the Palestinians in Gaza a choice. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=149.16s)]
*  Now on the question of hostages, Netanyahu and Donald Trump both said that there were [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  ongoing negotiations for another hostage release and for a ceasefire that may trigger that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=160.28s)]
*  Donald Trump talked extensively about the plight of the hostages and the families of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=168.28s)]
*  the hostages that he has met that have been released during his presidency. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA0U7UUB2k&t=172.28s)]
