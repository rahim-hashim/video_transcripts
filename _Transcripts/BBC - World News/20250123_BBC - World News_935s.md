# Investigation into China's use of psychiatric hospitals | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno)
*  There were two men. They forced me to get in the car. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=0.0s)]
*  They sent me to the mental hospital. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=5.0s)]
*  The doctors told me that I was in a very serious mental disease. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=7.0s)]
*  I'm investigating rumours that protesters in China are being locked up in psychiatric hospitals by police. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=12.0s)]
*  I'm trying to understand why doctors would work with police to hospitalise someone just for speaking out against the authorities. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=20.0s)]
*  This is a mental disorder. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=29.0s)]
*  I'm working with an underground network to uncover a story that China's sensors are trying to hide. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=34.0s)]
*  This abuse of psychiatric detention is illegal in China. I'm trying to find out why this is still happening. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=45.0s)]
*  My name is Nima. I lived and worked in Shanghai for nearly a decade. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=60.0s)]
*  This is Wulimuchi Road, the epicentre for the white paper protests in Shanghai. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=66.0s)]
*  People held up blank pieces of paper in defiance of strict censorship rules. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=72.0s)]
*  They were chanting against the zero Covid policy, against the Chinese Communist Party and against Xi Jinping. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=80.0s)]
*  There is little tolerance for public protest in China, so the authorities cracked down. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=91.0s)]
*  Police started to make arrests. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=97.0s)]
*  I found a Twitter thread by a white paper protester who had fled China. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=103.0s)]
*  He claimed he had been sent to a psychiatric hospital and had posted videos of his calls with police showing how he was still being intimidated. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=108.0s)]
*  Hello, what happened to my family? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=119.0s)]
*  They threatened a student who had fled China. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=123.0s)]
*  They threatened his family. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=128.0s)]
*  They are all in a coma. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=131.0s)]
*  I'm flying to New Zealand to meet Jinjia to find out more. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=134.0s)]
*  Hi Jinjia. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=141.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=142.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=143.0s)]
*  They forced me to a meeting room. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=173.0s)]
*  The U.S. police asked my father to bring me back to my hometown. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=178.0s)]
*  After we went back home, my father just called the police and he asked me to hand in my phone, my iPad and my laptop. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=184.0s)]
*  December 1st morning, my father, he was talking to someone on the phone and I saw a black car. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=195.0s)]
*  There were two men. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=202.0s)]
*  They forced me to get in the car. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=204.0s)]
*  They sent me to the mental hospital and the doctors told me that I was in a very serious mental disease. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=207.0s)]
*  I have to stay here for the treatment. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=216.0s)]
*  They tied me on a bed. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=220.0s)]
*  They said I was mentally ill. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=232.0s)]
*  Every time I think about it, I feel scared. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=236.0s)]
*  You can't imagine that you can say that because you have an opinion about the government, you have an opinion about the Communist Party, you are mentally ill. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=241.0s)]
*  Not only that, but also the doctors and nurses kept saying that I was mentally ill because I had an opinion about the party and the government. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=249.0s)]
*  I felt really scared. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=259.0s)]
*  I never thought that these things would happen to me. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=261.0s)]
*  Jinjia's medical records show he was hospitalized for two weeks and prescribed antipsychotic drugs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=264.0s)]
*  What do you think your parents thought about this diagnosis? Do you think they agreed? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=272.0s)]
*  I think my father, he was forced by a policeman because he is a member of the CCP and he works for the government so he had to make a choice. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=277.0s)]
*  I wonder how many other people, protesters, experience the same type of treatment and detention in psychiatric units that Jinjia faced. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=290.0s)]
*  Getting information out of China is difficult, but I did find some clues in old news reports from 15 years ago. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=300.0s)]
*  One sensational story shows how a woman was hospitalized by her mother after an argument over money. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=312.0s)]
*  A while ago, a special post was posted online that said this was a report from a psychiatric hospital. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=323.0s)]
*  I was held in the fourth People's Hospital in Nantong. The doctor forced me to take more than two types of psychiatric drugs. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=331.0s)]
*  I felt completely exhausted. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=337.0s)]
*  The media even came up with a name for it, Beijing Shengbing, or being mentally ill. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=341.0s)]
*  To stop this abuse, China introduced legislation to protect patients' rights in 2012. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=347.0s)]
*  The new regulations meant people could only be forcibly detained for treatment if they were a risk to themselves or others. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=356.0s)]
*  To police how effectively the new law worked, a group of citizen journalists called Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch documented ongoing abuses. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=367.0s)]
*  Between 2013 and 2017, more than 200 people reported that they'd been wrongfully hospitalized by the authorities. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=377.0s)]
*  Some activists risked filming in hospitals. They were investigating the disappearance of a veteran democracy activist called Song Zai-min. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=387.0s)]
*  Song Zai-min, the activist they were looking for, suddenly appeared at the door. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=417.0s)]
*  The activists accused the staff of breaking the law. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=447.0s)]
*  They wanted to send him out in advance. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=477.0s)]
*  It took about 10 days, half a month, for Song Zai-min to come out. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=479.0s)]
*  Following his release, they interviewed Song to find out why he was detained. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=488.0s)]
*  They came empty-handed and asked me to post a post in WeChat. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=493.0s)]
*  They wanted to invite the Civil Rights Committee or create a democratic country. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=501.0s)]
*  Psychological abuse has been a common method for a while now. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=507.0s)]
*  It's convenient, you don't need legal procedures, lawyers, family, or anything else. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=511.0s)]
*  He has no right to restrict me. He can be treated as he pleases. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=519.0s)]
*  If you're ill, you can be treated as you pleases. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=523.0s)]
*  I'm not ill, I don't need treatment. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=526.0s)]
*  In 2024, Song Zai-min was hospitalized for the fifth time. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=529.0s)]
*  His hospital records detail why. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=534.0s)]
*  The patient once again made false statements on the Internet, criticized the Communist Party, shouted slogans and organized illegal meetings. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=537.0s)]
*  He was admitted to our hospital for involuntary treatment. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=547.0s)]
*  Lu Youhuang Shuitao was involved in drafting China's mental health law and famous for fighting for patients' rights. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=552.0s)]
*  In recent years, the people have been weakening their power. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=561.0s)]
*  There have been many cases of abuse of mental health. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=567.0s)]
*  I think people with a little power can abuse me. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=571.0s)]
*  Back home, I find a lead in China's guidelines on how to manage mentally unwell people who disturb public order, referred to as troublemakers in official documents. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=578.0s)]
*  For patients posing a serious risk to public security, if the family do not cooperate, the emergency team should try to persuade them. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=593.0s)]
*  Do a good job of persuading the patient's relatives to send the patient to hospital. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=604.0s)]
*  Now I've seen it written in this official document. It feels like the police are trying to sidestep the courts, which means there's no effective oversight or accountability. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=609.0s)]
*  I want to know more about what happens to the activists in these psychiatric units. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=620.0s)]
*  Many survivors claim that they were subjected to electroshock therapy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=626.0s)]
*  Activist Jie Lijian says it happened to him. He now lives in Los Angeles. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=632.0s)]
*  We are the people of the People's Republic of China. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=639.0s)]
*  Jie told us that in July 2018, he took part in factory worker protests in Shenzhen. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=643.0s)]
*  He claims he was interrogated by police for three days, then taken to a psychiatric hospital. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=650.0s)]
*  After I entered the hospital, I told the security staff that the patient was in danger. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=658.0s)]
*  They should strengthen the control system and tie me down to a solid bed. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=664.0s)]
*  I was really scared. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=669.0s)]
*  It was very tight. I wanted to move my body a little bit, but I couldn't. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=671.0s)]
*  Then the nurse came over and asked me what I was sick with. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=677.0s)]
*  I said I was fine. She said I was still alive. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=681.0s)]
*  They all said I was fine. They gave me three different medicines. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=684.0s)]
*  They were very distracting. I didn't have the strength to take them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=688.0s)]
*  Jie told us that after a week in the hospital, he refused to take any more drugs and fought with hospital staff. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=696.0s)]
*  He was told he was causing trouble and sent for electroconvulsive therapy. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=704.0s)]
*  He was still in a state of shock. He was hit with a hammer. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=710.0s)]
*  He was hit with a hammer and his head was hit with two electric current devices. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=714.0s)]
*  It really hurt. He was hit and stopped. He was hit and stopped. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=719.0s)]
*  I died several times. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=723.0s)]
*  In 2019, the year after Jie told us he was hospitalized, China introduced new measures to limit the use of ECT, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=725.0s)]
*  which is listed with consent and under general anesthetic. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=735.0s)]
*  I want to understand to what extent the doctors were complicit in this abuse of psychiatric treatment. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=739.0s)]
*  Using an online doctor platform called Good Doctor, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=747.0s)]
*  we're targeting doctors working at the hospitals we know are involved with forced hospitalizations by police. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=751.0s)]
*  We've made appointments with their psychiatrists. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=759.0s)]
*  To avoid suspicion, we invented a nephew and explained to doctors that he has been hospitalized for posting anti-government comments online. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=764.0s)]
*  Have you seen this in your hospital? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=774.0s)]
*  The doctors sent the patients to your hospital for treatment? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=779.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=787.0s)]
*  The doctor confirmed that posting politically sensitive comments online is seen as trouble-making. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=788.0s)]
*  If the online comments are about the extent of criminal cases, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=795.0s)]
*  a hospital may need to have a diagnosis. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=803.0s)]
*  What kind of illness is this child suffering from? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=806.0s)]
*  The psychiatry department has a form of hospitalization called a case of [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=809.0s)]
*  mental illness. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=809.58s)]
*  For example, he is stabbed or injured outside. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=810.58s)]
*  This is a case of mental illness. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=819.58s)]
*  The public thinks that his online comments may also be suspected of disturbing social order. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=822.58s)]
*  The nature of the comments should be the same. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=830.58s)]
*  I was shocked to hear the psychiatrist admit that posting anti-government comments was grounds for admission to his hospital. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=833.58s)]
*  We found at least 112 people took the authorities to court, claiming they had been illegally held in psychiatric hospitals. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=842.58s)]
*  China's mental health law was meant to stop the abuse of psychiatric detention, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=852.58s)]
*  but it seems that the authorities are still able to silence troublemakers in psychiatric hospitals. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=858.58s)]
*  And for victims seeking justice, the legal system is stacked against them. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=865.58s)]
*  It's extremely difficult for me to forgive these people for hurting me, but I just want justice. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=888.58s)]
*  The police, the host staff and the government, they hurt me. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=898.58s)]
*  I cannot forgive the party, but I can forgive the person inside. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=904.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izI5EDgkWno&t=918.58s)]
