Video Description: Israeli forces have intercepted a yacht carrying activists and a small quantity of humanitarian aid that was trying to reach the Gaza Strip.
 
Climate activist Greta Thunberg and French lawmaker Rima Hassan, are among 12 people aboard the Madleen, with Thunberg saying they have been "kidnapped" in a video posted to social media. 
 
Israel's foreign ministry has branded it a "selfie yacht" carrying "less than a single truckload of aid".
 
It's not yet clear when the vessel will arrive in the Israeli port city of Ashdod - Israeli officials say it is still en route, after local media earlier reported the yacht had docked.
 
The Palestinian foreign ministry has called for protection of the activists' safety, and a UN official has asked for more ships to "sail together" to bring aid to Gaza.

*  Now, Israeli forces have taken control of a ship carrying Greta Thunberg and 11 other [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=0.0s)]
*  pro-Palestinian activists. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=5.26s)]
*  The Madeline, which was carrying a small but symbolic amount of aid for Gaza, was boarded [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=7.48s)]
*  as it tried to break a naval blockade. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=12.22s)]
*  It's now being towed to an Israeli port. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  Videos and images were posted by the crew of the Madeline as it tried to reach Gaza, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=17.54s)]
*  including this image showing the crew seated on the vessel, all wearing life jackets with [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=22.0s)]
*  their hands in the air. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=26.46s)]
*  After which, the volunteers said a white irritant was being sprayed onto the decks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=27.86s)]
*  Each of the activists on board the Madeline, including this one from the Swedish climate [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=87.86s)]
*  activist Greta Thunberg, who said the team had been intercepted and kidnapped. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=92.8s)]
*  I urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=98.08s)]
*  to release me and the others as soon as possible. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=104.6s)]
*  We're just hearing on Reuters that the Turkish Foreign Ministry says that the intervention [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=108.64s)]
*  by Israeli forces on the ship, the Madeline, is a clear violation of international law, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=113.68s)]
*  that report coming in from the Reuters news agency. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, Israel's Foreign Minister has called the voyage a public relations stunt. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  It says the crew were unharmed and that the ship was being redirected to Israeli shores [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  and that those on board would be returned to their home countries. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=133.06s)]
*  The Israeli Foreign Ministry circulated what appeared to be Israeli military personnel [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=136.62s)]
*  handing out sandwiches and water to the activists, as well as a video it says shows the Navy [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=141.24s)]
*  giving the order on the ship to divert. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=146.7s)]
*  The maritime zone of the coast of Gaza is closed to naval traffic as part of a legal [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=150.06s)]
*  naval blockade. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=156.02s)]
*  If you wish to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, you are able to do so through [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=157.64s)]
*  the port of Ashdod via the established channels and distribution centers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=162.94s)]
*  Well, for the latest, let's speak to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bishogh in Jerusalem. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  So, Hugo, what's the latest on this then? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=172.78s)]
*  Yeah, Regina, so there have been reports in Israeli media suggesting that the boat has [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=177.22s)]
*  now arrived at the port of Ashdod in southern Israel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  This hasn't been officially confirmed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=184.94s)]
*  And the Israeli authorities say that all 12 passengers of the boat are going to be deported, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  sent back to their home country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=192.66s)]
*  So I think we're not going to be hearing from them before they arrive back in their countries. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=194.42s)]
*  Now this is a boat that was organized by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=200.78s)]
*  And they said that the goal with this mission was to raise awareness of the humanitarian [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=204.5s)]
*  crisis in Gaza because of the restrictions that have been imposed by Israel on the distribution [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=208.82s)]
*  of aid. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=215.17999999999998s)]
*  Nobody was expecting them to reach Gaza because Israel has intercepted all efforts by organizations, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=216.42s)]
*  by Israeli groups to breach this naval blockade of Gaza that has been in place since 2007 [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=223.5s)]
*  when Hamas took control of the territory. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=230.3s)]
*  Now the Israeli Foreign Ministry described this as a selfie yacht and that the show was [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  over. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=240.02s)]
*  So we're still waiting to hear what is going to happen to these 12 passengers. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=241.02s)]
*  OK, Hugo Bishogh with the very latest on that developing story. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=244.10000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=247.82s)]
*  That's Hugo Bishogh in Jerusalem. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqSlPTs29s&t=248.82s)]
