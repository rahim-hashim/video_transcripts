Video Description: Germany’s conservative CDU/CSU party is celebrating after exit polls projected them to be the largest party in the federal parliament - or Bundestag - with 28.5% of the vote.

The conservative leader Friedrich Merz, who is now expected to become Germany's next chancellor, hailed a "terrific election campaign" and said there was no time to waste in forming a government.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is set to become the second largest party in the country, with a record 20.6% of the vote according to the exit polls.

US President Donald Trump congratulated Germany's conservatives on social media, calling it "a great day for Germany" - and for the United States under his leadership.

Millions voted in Germany for a new federal government after the three-party coalition fell apart at the end of last year, prompting a snap election.

*  Our Europe editor Katja Adler is in Berlin. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=27.6s)]
*  Sophie, one thing is clear as you say. Friedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU party, is tipped to be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=34.0s)]
*  Germany's next Chancellor. But what's less clear is what his governing coalition is going to look [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  like. And that matters because Germany is a big continental power. And from a European perspective, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=46.08s)]
*  things out there look pretty unpredictable, almost threatening. Whether you look at China [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=52.0s)]
*  or Russia, what's traditionally the key European ally, the United States. And as long as Germany's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=56.4s)]
*  coalition building, it is distracted. Friedrich Merz, though, is in a hurry. He points to Europe's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=62.56s)]

*  on the world stage fast. With a spring in his step, the man likely to be Germany's next Chancellor, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=79.12s)]
*  usually pretty dure in his demeanor, allowed himself a brief beam at the party faithful [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  before getting down to serious business. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  Dear friends, the world outside won't wait for us. We need to get our domestic politics right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=101.44s)]
*  We need to be more present on the EU and the world stage. Germany will have a reliable government [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=106.16s)]
*  again. Let's celebrate now and the hard work begins tomorrow, is what he said. Robert Merz [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=111.44s)]
*  has dreamt all of his life of becoming Germany's next Chancellor. But he knows the challenges at [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=119.44s)]
*  home and abroad are huge. Germany's economy is so big. It's such a key player in NATO and the EU [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=125.12s)]
*  that success or failure here impacts all of Europe. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=132.08s)]
*  And Germany is divided. As Friedrich Merz was speaking inside party headquarters, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=139.04s)]
*  these protesters outside tried to drown him out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=145.12s)]
*  While on the other side of Berlin, the hard right AFD was smiling through gritted teeth. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=150.56s)]
*  They wanted us to half our support, but we doubled it, said the party leader. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=157.28s)]
*  Since World War II, no far-right force has ever had this success in Germany. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=163.68s)]
*  It'll be frozen out of government, though, considered too extreme by traditional parties here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=169.44s)]
*  The AFD says they're wrong. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=175.68s)]
*  Even without the AFD, coalition building is a tricky business. Bargaining, bartering, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=180.4s)]
*  even bickering is usual. But voters I met at this Berlin market today [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=186.32s)]
*  said politicians had no time to lose. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  We need a new government fast. We are drowning in problems, money, migration, defense. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=196.32s)]
*  I think we need to build a new government quickly because the world feels like a dangerous place [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=203.04s)]
*  right now. Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Germans worry about the safety and future of their country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=207.44s)]
*  And of Ukraine. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Kiev after the U.S. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=215.6s)]
*  But it's not sure it's ready to send boots on the ground there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=223.27999999999997s)]
*  Berlin's Brandenburg Gate is a military monument that's come to symbolize peace and unity, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=228.0s)]
*  neither of which Germany or Europe have right now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  This continent is scrambling to get its act together. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=238.16s)]
*  Tonight's results point to stronger leadership from one of its biggest powers. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_x4JPZ8bC0&t=241.67999999999998s)]
