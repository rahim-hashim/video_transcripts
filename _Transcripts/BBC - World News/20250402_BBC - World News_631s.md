Video Description: US President Donald Trump is preparing to unveil sweeping tariffs, in what the White House has dubbed "Liberation Day‚Äù.

He will outline the plans at the White House later today, but at this stage it's unclear how high the tariffs could go and exactly which countries could be targeted. 

Trump argues the tariffs will help US manufacturers by encouraging consumers to buy American-made goods, but analysts warned it could push up prices and trigger a trade war.

The White House said Trump is open to last-minute talks, with "quite a few" countries calling the president on the eve of the announcement.

# Donald Trump set to announce sweeping global tariffs on US 'Liberation Day' | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs)
*  The countdown is on to Donald Trump's so-called Liberation Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=0.0s)]
*  In just 12 hours time, the president will announce sweeping global tariffs on products [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=4.24s)]
*  imported to the United States. The announcement could affect trillions of dollars of U.S. imports [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  and there are fears that it could trigger a global trade war. Well, the head of the European [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=14.8s)]
*  Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the EU was ready to retaliate to protect its interests, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=19.28s)]
*  while Sakiya Stama has said that all options are on the table for the United Kingdom. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=25.52s)]
*  The Trump administration insists that the policy will improve American competitiveness [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  despite hefty criticism and widespread economic uncertainty. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=35.04s)]
*  Those days of America, beginning tomorrow, being ripped off are over. American workers [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  and businesses will be put first under President Trump, just as he promised on the campaign trail. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=46.56s)]
*  The president's historic action tomorrow will improve American competitiveness in every area [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=52.88s)]
*  of industry, reduce our massive trade deficits and ultimately protect our economic and national security. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=58.08s)]
*  Well, President Trump has already imposed a range of tariffs that target key industries and major [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=65.52s)]
*  economies. The threat of new levies heightened tensions with some of America's historically [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=70.72s)]
*  closest trading partners, namely Canada and Mexico. Here's what the leaders of Canada and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=76.0s)]
*  Mexico had to say about their country's responses to the threat of fresh tariffs. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=81.2s)]
*  As I made clear to President Trump in our call last week, I will reject, I will reject all [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=87.12s)]
*  attempts to weaken Canada, all attempts to wear us down, to break us down so that America can own [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=93.2s)]
*  us. That will never ever happen. We do not believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=101.44s)]
*  because that always leads to a bad situation. Of course, measures are taken in Mexico because [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=111.44s)]
*  measures are taken on the other side, but the dialogue has to continue. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=116.72s)]
*  So let's talk to Yanis Varoufakis, former Greek finance minister, also author. And sir, you were [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=122.88s)]
*  of course at the helm of Greece's negotiations during the economic crisis that was triggered [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=128.8s)]
*  by the 2008 financial crash. Is Liberation Day potentially going to trigger something as large [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=134.08s)]
*  as that 2008 financial crash? A better analogy to 2008 is 1971, because this Trump shock, which [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=140.72s)]
*  we are all expecting with bated breath to hit us today, is not unprecedented. President Richard [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=150.64s)]
*  Nixon delivered the original shock in 1971 with very similar objectives. The objective of Nixon [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=157.92s)]
*  was to rein in the diminution of America's importance in the global economy, following [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=166.16s)]
*  the conversion of America from a surplus, a trade surplus country to a trade deficit country. He [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=173.44s)]
*  essentially unleashed a major economic war against Europe and against Asia, Japan in that case, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  for the purposes of devaluing the American dollar, which he succeeded in doing. And you know, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=187.44s)]
*  everything that we have been experiencing in the last 30, 40, 50 years as the status quo was the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=192.72s)]
*  result of that Nixon shock. So Trump is trying to create his own version of the Nixon shock. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=198.0s)]
*  And I think we need to draw lessons from that. And allow me to say, because I was listening to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=203.12s)]
*  your program, when I hear Ursula von der Leyen or the Canadian prime minister trying to outcompete [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=208.64s)]
*  Trump in terms of bravado, my message to them is, folks, when you're running a very large trade [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=216.16s)]
*  deficit, especially the European Union, you know, $240 billion of a trade surplus or deficit [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=222.56s)]
*  with the United States, you cannot win a tariff war against Trump, because you will run out of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=229.2s)]
*  things to tariff before he does. So we better look inside our own economies for ways of changing our [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  own economic model, given that he is trying to emulate Nixon and, you know, blow up the prevailing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=243.04s)]
*  monetary and trade system. So that fighting talk from the EU, that arguably is not the right [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=250.48s)]
*  direction. We know that Sir Keir Starmer, the head of the leader of the UK, of course, is talking [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=255.92s)]
*  about not issuing retaliatory measures. Is that the way to go? Well, it's one of the very rare [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=261.12s)]
*  occasions I agree with Keir Starmer on anything. But I think he's right on this, that the best [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  retaliation is no retaliation when you are in the weaker position, because you're running a surplus [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  with the United States. What we should be doing in the United Kingdom, in the European Union, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=280.08s)]
*  what China should be doing, we should all be looking at ways of rebalancing our own economies, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=286.4s)]
*  so that we do not rely on the American trade deficit for selling our net exports to the United [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=292.16s)]
*  States. Why can't we raise our own levels of investment and our own levels of aggregate [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  demand within Europe, within the United Kingdom, within China, so that we don't need to rely on the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  trade deficit of the United States? Is that realistic? I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  Is, I mean, yeah, doing it in-house, is that arguably realistic, given that so much is exported [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=317.6s)]
*  to the US? There's a reason for that. The markets work themselves out. So is it realistic to do it [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  in-house? There is nothing else which is realistic. Trump has declared it, and I believe that this is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=330.16s)]
*  going to be a bipartisan position in the years to come. Whoever succeeds Donald Trump, we have to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  learn to live in a world where we can no longer export deflationary forces to the United States. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=342.08s)]
*  I'm all for increasing trade, selling more, but we have to buy more, not just for the United States. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=350.4s)]
*  This idea that, for instance, Germany had, that it can continue to piggyback on other people's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=355.36s)]
*  demand in order to maintain a model, an industrial model, which is suppressing the living standards [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=361.84s)]
*  of the German middle class and working class in order to continue to export massive quantities [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=369.6s)]
*  of stuff without importing equivalent amounts from its trading partners. This is a sure way [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=377.04s)]
*  of becoming dependent on capricious leaders like Donald Trump. Yanis, let's just focus in on Greece. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, you're Greece's former finance minister, and Greece is within the EU bloc. So [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=395.12s)]
*  you negotiate. Greece will be negotiating with the EU. We've heard what you think of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=400.0s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen's stance there. You historically said that the euros, like hotel [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=403.92s)]
*  California, the song by the eagles, a place you can check out but you can never arguably leave. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=408.72s)]
*  Greece is binded now with whatever the EU does. What's the future for Greece when it comes to this [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=414.48s)]
*  liberation day that we're expecting from Donald Trump? It's not looking very good, I'm afraid, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=420.24s)]
*  because Greece is not going to be affected directly by Trump's tariffs because we don't [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=425.44s)]
*  sell that much to the United States. But Greece is utterly dependent as a result of having turned it [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  to effectively a debt colony of the European Union over the last 20 years. It is utterly affected by [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=438.64s)]
*  the capacity of the German industrial model to continue functioning. And I'm afraid that the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=445.12s)]
*  German industrial model has shown very sure signs recently that it is kaput, that it is gone. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=450.32s)]
*  It is simply not able to compete with Chinese technologies, especially when it comes to electric [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=457.36s)]
*  vehicles, when it comes to green energy, because let's face it, in Germany and in Europe we have [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=463.6s)]
*  not invested in the last 15 years. We had zero actual productive net investment. And so countries [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=469.28s)]
*  like Greece are essentially hoping for the best while watching Ursula von der Leyen and the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  incoming Chancellor of Germany trying to maintain business as usual when business cannot be [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=485.76s)]
*  maintained as usual. And just as a final thought, your assessment on how much the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=492.48s)]
*  Trump administration will stick to this, because obviously we know he fluctuates. He says one thing, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  he does something else. Economic instability, markets hate that. But how likely is it that he [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=503.6s)]
*  will continue with what he declares later on today? I think we overestimate the capriciousness of [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=510.72s)]
*  Donald Trump. And he does flood the zone. This is the Steve Bannon expression, in order to keep us [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=519.44s)]
*  guessing. But that's part of his strategy. It's not that his mind is changing. He keeps us guessing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=526.4000000000001s)]
*  My view is that the tariffs are here to stay. They are imposed on everyone, friend and foe [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=532.72s)]
*  simultaneously. They are a blanket tariff. And then once they're there, essentially what we're [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  talking about is increasing the average tariffs in the United States from 25%, which is where they [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=545.36s)]
*  used to be, to some like 20, 25%. This is a massive increase. And then coming to each one of us, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=552.24s)]
*  to the Brits, to the French, to the Germans, the Japanese, to the Koreans, to the Chinese, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=559.12s)]
*  and negotiating individually, keeping us apart, keep us weak, and effectively exact his pound of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=564.0799999999999s)]
*  flesh and different pounds of flesh, different types of flesh from different countries. So from [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=570.88s)]
*  the Japanese, who have $1.2 trillion, the last time I counted, of dollar savings, he will want [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=574.64s)]
*  to sell those dollars in exchange for very long dated American debt. From the Germans, he's going [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=582.96s)]
*  to demand that the German government doesn't do anything to impede the migration of whole [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=591.12s)]
*  production lines from Volkswagen and BMW and Basf and Siemens to the United States. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=598.48s)]
*  So that's his strategy. It is a mistake to think that just because he's inepticulate, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=604.96s)]
*  and for some of us politically, a very poor excuse for human nature, that he doesn't have a plan. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=610.72s)]
*  He does have a plan. We don't have a plan. It's about time we got one. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=616.8s)]
*  I'm sure his supporters think very differently to your view of Donald Trump, but Yanis Varoufakis [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=620.72s)]
*  has always really good to get your insight. Fascinating insight there. Thank you so much. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dduefDMgoUs&t=626.32s)]
