Video Description: The prime minster has called on MPs to "put self-interest aside" and "work constructively together" to find a way forward for Brexit.
Theresa May said she had met with the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru, but was "disappointed" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not chosen to take part in discussions.
Earlier, the prime minister won a vote of no confidence by 325 to 306, as rebel Tory MPs and the DUP backed her to stay in No 10.
But just 24 hours before, both groups ensured her Brexit plan was voted down in Parliament by an historic margin.

*  agree with the European Union was rejected by MPs and by a large margin. I believe it [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  is my duty to deliver on the British people's instruction to leave the European Union and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  I intend to do so. So now MPs have made clear what they don't want, we must all work constructively [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=47.94s)]
*  together to set out what Parliament does want. That's why I'm inviting MPs from all parties [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=56.36s)]
*  to come together to find a way forward. One that both delivers on the referendum and can [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=63.8s)]

*  Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru. From tomorrow meetings will be taking place [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=82.12s)]
*  between senior government representatives including myself and groups of MPs who represent [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=88.72s)]
*  the widest possible range of views from across Parliament including our confidence and supply [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=95.14s)]
*  partners the Democratic Unionist Party. I am disappointed that the leader of the Labour [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=100.54s)]
*  Party has not so far chosen to take part but our door remains open. It will not be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=106.86s)]
*  an easy task but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=114.98s)]
*  and get this done. In a historic vote in 2016 the country decided to leave the EU. In 2017 [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=122.74s)]
*  80% of people voted for parties that stood on manifestos promising to respect that result. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=133.46s)]
*  Now over two and a half years later it's time for us to come together, put the national [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=141.28s)]
*  interest first and deliver on the referendum. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6Q8hTjGvI&t=147.28s)]
