# ‘Meeting the stranger who saved my life’ - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 31, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE)
*  I think a lot of people think when you're thinking about suicide that you don't think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=0.0s)]
*  about the impact on other people. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=10.4s)]
*  It was the 24th of March 2017 that I decided was going to be my last day alive. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=29.0s)]
*  In all honesty it had been a decision I'd been thinking about for quite a long time [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=49.2s)]
*  because I ultimately lost work as a result of my mental health and spent some time in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=54.64s)]
*  hospital and I came to the conclusion that I had no future because if I couldn't work [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=61.92s)]
*  then I wasn't useful to anyone. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=67.84s)]
*  So that day, I'd actually tried to get help that day. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  I'd actually been to the doctor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=79.76s)]
*  I was open about the thoughts that had gone into my head about doing it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=84.08s)]
*  And I think when you go home feeling like nothing's changed then it sort of takes away [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=88.64s)]
*  that last bit of hope. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=93.32s)]
*  I was working an evening shift that day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=103.72s)]
*  That was my second day driving as a qualified driver so I was let loose after a year and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  a bit of training out on a big wide world doing my thing on my own. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=112.0s)]
*  And I think I took a train from Bedford down to Bryson which is our longest route that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=117.72s)]
*  we do and had a break and was turning around and coming back from Bryson up north. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=121.6s)]
*  No I didn't have dinner because that was actually a massive factor in that when I don't eat [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=130.6s)]
*  My head goes completely... and that makes suicidal thoughts incredibly more strong for me. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=135.56s)]
*  So I was just absolutely exhausted. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=145.04s)]
*  I was just drained by the thought of life. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=147.04s)]
*  I just didn't want to fight it anymore. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=149.04s)]
*  I wanted to explain to my family. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=154.64s)]
*  So I think I wrote two letters. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=158.48s)]
*  I wrote one to my dad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=159.48s)]
*  I just wanted to tell him that I loved him and how wonderful he is. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=161.48s)]
*  And then I wrote one to apologise to the train driver. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=166.92s)]
*  I didn't think they'd be affected in the sense of being traumatised. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=172.0s)]
*  I thought they'd be angry. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=176.6s)]
*  And I didn't want them to hate me for doing it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=178.6s)]
*  So I wrote a letter to explain that which I kept in my pocket when I left my house. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  When you think about someone who is feeling suicidal you tend to think of it as quite [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=190.48s)]
*  dramatic. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=198.88s)]
*  But it's the little things that hit you hardest. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=199.88s)]
*  It's just walking down the street and just thinking I'm not going to be here anymore. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=203.56s)]
*  I'm not going to see my dad again. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to see my brother again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  I was going through my normal procedures. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  I'd applied the break. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=216.64s)]
*  I could just see the lights coming. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  And I just stood there and I just waited and I just watched it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=220.88s)]
*  I was just fixated on it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=224.48s)]
*  Driving along and looking down looking out the window and just thought that's not right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=226.48s)]
*  I just remember it being so cold and I just stood there like just so cold just watching [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=233.48s)]
*  it coming closer obviously. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=240.84s)]
*  Well you done love ya? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=243.84s)]
*  Literally in an instant I saw a face appear. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=247.04s)]
*  It must have been that split second. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=249.24s)]
*  It hit my horn quickly. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=251.24s)]
*  And I think that was probably what hit my brain enough that I didn't take that final step. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=255.24s)]
*  And I saw the face sort of disappear. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=264.24s)]
*  I pulled into the station and stopped as normal and obviously was a bit worried. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=266.64s)]
*  I didn't think I'd hit the person but you don't know so I was just waiting to see if [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=278.64s)]
*  I could see what had happened and fortunately Liv was making her way up along the platform. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=282.64s)]
*  I think at that point when you realise that you haven't done it, that's the point where [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=288.64s)]
*  you think okay I don't know what to do now because he's seen me. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  Obviously I made an announcement to the passengers, stepped off the train and in the distance [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  I could see a figure, I could see Liv. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  She was in total shock. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  I said you know when you were called after are you okay? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  She turned around and we started having a conversation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  I just remember him trying to reassure me because I was so scared and then he was just [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  looking at me. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=321.44s)]
*  He was trying to find out a bit about what was going on and about what I was trying to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=322.44s)]
*  do and why. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=326.44s)]
*  He asked me a lot about my family and my dad and he told me that he had a son and he explained [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=330.44s)]
*  about his previous job as a firefighter and how he'd seen it from the other side and the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=336.44s)]
*  impact that it has. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=342.44s)]
*  We must have spoke for five, ten minutes and I was happy that I could help her in that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=344.44s)]
*  Liv was facing, being quite open and talking to a complete stranger about reasons that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=348.84s)]
*  maybe she's not vocalised with her friends or family. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=354.84s)]
*  At the time I thought hopefully that helps. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=357.84s)]
*  He was so calm and he was just so caring and that's the thing that makes the biggest difference [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=359.84s)]
*  when you're with anyone in crisis. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=367.84s)]
*  Just having someone that kind and that genuine kind of gives you that bit of hope again. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=371.23999999999995s)]
*  On that night he obviously saved my life. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=380.23999999999995s)]
*  So we're going to Bedford today to meet the driver who helped me the night that I tried [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=401.23999999999995s)]
*  to end my life. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=412.23999999999995s)]
*  To be able to say thank you to him and that it did make a difference and hopefully for [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=415.23999999999995s)]
*  him to see or for him to know that he did help because I don't know how he feels about [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  it either. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=426.23999999999995s)]
*  It's going to be nice to meet her. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=431.23999999999995s)]
*  It would be nice to see what's happened since that point from her point of view. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=434.23999999999995s)]
*  I know from my point of view obviously I think about it quite regularly and especially when [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  I'm in the area, the place where we did meet. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  So I'm kind of here today to meet her and see how her life's changed and what positive [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=444.23999999999995s)]
*  things she's done with it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=449.23999999999995s)]
*  Liv? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=457.23999999999995s)]
*  You OK? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=458.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=459.23999999999995s)]
*  How are you? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=460.64s)]
*  How have you been? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=468.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=469.64s)]
*  Yeah, pretty good at the moment. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=470.64s)]
*  Good. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=473.64s)]
*  Have a seat. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=474.64s)]
*  What have you been up to since we met? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=476.64s)]
*  Things have been pretty alright the last few months. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=480.64s)]
*  I've been doing a lot with the police at the moment. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=484.64s)]
*  I've been doing some training with them on how to help in mental health crisis. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh, that's excellent. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  That's an element that I'm not used to, you know, and I had to be really subjective. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  I had to listen to her, you know, we had to talk and I wanted to... [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it worked really well because I think once you've kind of got someone to just stop [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  and engage then you're kind of there really. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to be angry, everyone's going to hate me, everyone's going to be like [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  judging me and stuff. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=514.04s)]
*  When you're in that situation I can imagine that's what you think. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  There's so many more people out there, like we were talking about, your family and you [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  know, there's people out there that even if you don't, at that time you may not be ready [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  to speak to each other. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  Like for me, family is a big thing because I lost my mum and I was like, I will never [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  put my brother through that, I will never put my dad through that, but sometimes I just [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  need a bit of help to remember. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  But now you've got, now you're doing the right things and you've got that focus. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=541.84s)]
*  Every time I go into that station I do look out for you in a positive way, I do look out [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=548.84s)]
*  for you. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=553.84s)]
*  Well I always find weird life in crisis, like you see someone at the worst point of your [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=556.84s)]
*  life and you don't know anything about each other but they just happen to be sitting in [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=561.84s)]
*  the most private and personal things in your head. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=565.84s)]
*  Seeing all of you almost. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=568.84s)]
*  And then you never see them again normally. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqz_Vka_KiE&t=570.24s)]
