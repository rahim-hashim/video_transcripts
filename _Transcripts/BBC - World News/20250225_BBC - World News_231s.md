Video Description: US government workers faced widespread confusion on Monday following conflicting advice over compliance with an Elon Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination.

Just 48 hours after an email asking "what did you do last week?" was sent, the office behind it clarified responses were voluntary, leaving agencies to decide their approach.

But as this new guidance was shared with federal agencies, President Donald Trump weighed in that workers who did not comply with Mr Musk's demand would be fired or "sort of semi-fired".

And later on Monday evening, Mr Musk reinforced the ultimatum, granting workers a final chance to respond.

# Federal workers left confused as deadline expires to reply to Elon Musk email | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg)
*  Now at midnight in Washington, a deadline passed for US federal employees to respond to an email [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=0.0s)]
*  sent by Elon Musk. The email sent over the weekend was headlined What Did You Do Last Week? and asked [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=5.76s)]
*  recipients to reply with approximately five bullet points outlining their accomplishments in the last [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=11.36s)]
*  week and CC their manager. Well Mr Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency or DOJ as [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=16.96s)]
*  it's known, has since admitted that the email quotes was basically a check to see if the employee [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=22.48s)]
*  had a pulse and was capable of replying to an email. President Trump defended the email as a way [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=27.68s)]
*  of weeding out people who, quotes, didn't even exist. Let's speak to CBS correspondent Jared Hill in New York. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=33.28s)]
*  Jared, there's been some confusion hasn't there around this with different sets of instructions [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=39.68s)]
*  to employees. Just tell us more on that. That's right Geeta, so different sets of instructions from [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  different aspects of the Trump administration. On one hand you do have these emails coming from [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Elon Musk saying that folks have to send over this bullet point, these five bullet points about [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=55.04s)]
*  what they did in the week prior, but at the same time we have seen a number of Trump agency heads [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=60.08s)]
*  saying that their employees do not have to send over this email. We're talking in particular [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=66.24s)]
*  Department of Defense as well as intelligence departments and some of the Homeland Security [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Departments as well. At the same time there is another email going out from another office, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=76.48s)]
*  the Office of Personnel Management saying that it's up to the department head themselves on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=81.76s)]
*  whether they have to require their employees to send over this document. All of this again getting [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  to the end of who actually has to respond to this, by when and what kind of consequences would there [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=93.44s)]
*  be because although we have seen Elon Musk saying that there would be terminations if folks don't [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  send that over, yesterday President Trump said people would be sort of fired or not really fired. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=103.76s)]
*  So again the question is what is this for? Is it clear who has ultimate authority on this because [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=109.68s)]
*  this is obviously real because it's about people's jobs? That is a great question. So what we do know [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=117.52s)]
*  is that there are already in the works some lawsuits to try and block this attempt from some [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=123.92s)]
*  of the unions that represent workers in the federal government here in the United States. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=128.8s)]
*  So that's going to work its way through the courts and if it gets to that level the courts [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=133.6s)]
*  will decide whether Elon Musk or whomever has the authority to push this through. But at the same [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=137.44s)]
*  time we are also seeing some windows being given to again some of these department heads here in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=142.8s)]
*  the U.S. to tell their specific employees they do not have to comply with this one. And so at least [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  at this point it seems as though this will be left up to a combination of the courts for the broader [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=154.8s)]
*  question but then also those department heads specifically for the individual agencies. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=161.36s)]
*  And how is this going down at the moment with U.S. voters? Do we have any clear idea on that? I mean [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  could it actually alienate some Trump supporters? So we're starting to get an idea of how this is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=171.36s)]
*  playing out with the American public. On a larger scale this seems to be relatively popular. That's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=177.12s)]
*  counting both Republicans and Democrats but when you look at the breakdown from at least a party [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  line level there's a complete split here with a lot of Republicans saying that they're largely [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  in favor of Democrats saying not at all. What we have started to see though are at a number of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=193.28s)]
*  these town hall events as some Republican members of Congress, our version of MPs, as they start to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=197.92s)]
*  go back home to their home districts speaking to their constituents we have seen essentially [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=203.6s)]
*  protests popping up at some of those events. With that there are also some lawmakers who have started [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=209.2s)]
*  to dial back their language and saying that maybe there should be some studies on how this impacts [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=214.4s)]
*  the American workers. Again not nearly as much of a full-throated support as we had seen just maybe [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=220.08s)]
*  a couple of days ago. Jared Hill in New York, many thanks. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy_3s0wQSxg&t=227.04000000000002s)]
