# Gaza officials report six killed in aid centre shooting | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw)
*  There's been another shooting incident near a US-backed aid distribution centre in southern Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza's civil defence agency says six Palestinians were killed and several wounded by Israeli gunfire [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=6.08s)]
*  while gathering to collect food supplies. The Israeli military said it fired warning shots [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=12.72s)]
*  at suspects who approached them in a threatening manner. Separately, the Israeli military also [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  announced today it's recovered the body of a Thai hostage who'd been held in Gaza since Hamas's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=24.64s)]
*  October the 7th attack on Israel. Natapong Pinta was an agricultural worker in southern Israel when [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=30.72s)]
*  he was kidnapped. The Israel defence forces said his body had been retrieved during a special [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=36.96s)]
*  operation in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. Israel believes around 20 hostages are still alive [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=42.24s)]
*  in the territory. Our correspondent Barbara Blett-Asher spoke to us from Jerusalem. First, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  she told us more about this latest shooting incident. Well, Louis, it happened at a roundabout [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=53.92s)]
*  in southern Gaza where Palestinians gather before the aid distribution site opens. So this is the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=60.56s)]
*  place where we've had those shootings earlier in the week. People gather, tens of thousands of them [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=68.8s)]
*  waiting for access to this distribution site and then in the process of getting to it there have [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=75.12s)]
*  been firings and shootings and dozens have been killed, hundreds injured. Now what happened, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=82.16s)]
*  it sounds like something similar. An eyewitness, the civil defence agency said that the Israelis [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=88.24s)]
*  had opened fire on the crowd. What the Israelis said was they had warned the Gazans that this area [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=95.28s)]
*  outside the distribution centre was a combat zone from six in the evening to six in the morning [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=102.8s)]
*  and that several individuals had approached them in a threatening manner and they had opened fire [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=108.24s)]
*  with warning shots. They said they were aware of the reports of the casualties. Now this is a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=113.36s)]
*  similar scenario to what they talked about on Tuesday when many more Palestinians were killed, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=117.84s)]
*  that they had fired at suspects that veered toward them and didn't pay attention to warning [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=123.36s)]
*  shots. So this is quite a volatile area for the Palestinians to have to wait and pass through to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  get to the aid distribution site. The company or the organisation that runs these distribution [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=134.72s)]
*  centres shut things down for a bit this week trying to improve the centres, trying to improve [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=140.16s)]
*  because there's been massive overcrowding and also to improve the safety. But it looks as if there's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=146.16s)]
*  still that kind of dynamic where the Palestinians who gather for food in the morning are in danger [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=151.68s)]
*  of either death or injury. And Barbara, given the similarities to those previous incidents that you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=158.96s)]
*  are outlining there and the criticism of this particular aid operation from many international [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=165.28s)]
*  organisations through the week, how damaging will these reports be? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=172.0s)]
*  Well I don't think they're going to improve the reputation of this model of distribution. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  There have been many criticisms as you said from international aid organisations and from the UN [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  but the ones that deal with how effective it is have pointed out that the way that they distribute [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  aid, international aid organisations, is to take the food supplies to the communities and deliver [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=198.56s)]
*  them according to like a registration list to the people that they know need it in an orderly way. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=204.56s)]
*  This is quite a different model because it requires Palestinians to come to several big [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=210.96s)]
*  distribution hubs which means they have to travel from different parts of the Gaza Strip. Some of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=216.4s)]
*  them walk for hours which means they have to gather at a certain point until they're allowed in and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=221.04s)]
*  which creates these security issues we've been seeing because at least in this southern hub [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  they have to pass through an Israeli military zone which puts them in close proximity with Israeli [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=235.68s)]
*  soldiers. So as I said there were efforts this week to try to improve the situation and how it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=240.48s)]
*  works but given that something similar has happened again that isn't going to stop the criticism. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  And Barbara let's move to the second significant development, the recovery of that body by the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  Israeli forces. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=261.12s)]
*  Yes, the Israeli army said that it had recovered the body of Nuttapung Pinta from the area of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=265.92s)]
*  Rafa in southern Gaza. It was a special operation, a joint operation with the military troops as well [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=274.48s)]
*  as intelligence agency and they had been able to get precise information about the location of the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=280.16s)]
*  body after conducting an interrogation of a prisoner of what they called a captured terrorist [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=287.44s)]
*  and they have brought the body back and they have notified the family which is preparing to receive [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=293.92s)]
*  Mr. Nuttapung Pinta and bury him. He was a 35 year old married father of a young son. He had come to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=299.92s)]
*  Israel like many people from Thailand to work in the kibbutz near the Gaza Strip in the agriculture [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=309.04s)]
*  there and he was captured the army says on the day of the October attack led by Hamas although [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=315.04s)]
*  the group that captured him was a different one it was called the Mujahideen brigades brought into [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=321.04s)]
*  Gaza and then the Israeli army says that he was killed in captivity. We did try to contact his [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  wife, the BBC tried to contact his wife. She did not answer the call but she did send a text with [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=333.04s)]
*  a photograph of his little son and who was crying. Barbara Platt Usher with that update. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaeEImqj9fw&t=340.24s)]
