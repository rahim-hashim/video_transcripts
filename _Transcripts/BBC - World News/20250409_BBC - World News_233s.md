Video Description: US President Donald Trump has placed a 46% tariff on all goods imported to the US from Vietnam, causing worries for some US businesses and consumers.
 
About half of Nike and 39% of Adidas trainers are made in Vietnam, and Samsung also has significant production operations in the country.
 
Vietnam has been hit with a 46% tariff on goods it wants to import to the US. So a pair of trainers that cost £114 before the tariffs, will now face an import cost of £146.
 
The exact price at a retail store will depend on how much of the cost Nike – or any firm importing to the US – decides to pass on to the customer.

# How Trump’s tariffs on Vietnam might affect US businesses | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs)
*  Now, we have been hearing about the new US tariffs that have come into force today, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=0.0s)]
*  one of the countries that is impacted is Vietnam. It's being hit with a 46% tariff on all goods [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=5.08s)]
*  imported or sent to the US. So this country saw a surge in manufacturing that moved from [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  China after the first Trump presidency when he imposed tariffs on China then. And many [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=19.88s)]
*  US companies have therefore been making their products in Vietnam. So how will this impact [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=25.12s)]
*  them? And will they look to move production to the US, for example? I talked to Andrew [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=30.68s)]
*  Gibbs-Dabney, who is founder of Livson, which is a US outdoor wear brand. Its company has [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=36.0s)]
*  their clothing made in Vietnam. I asked him how the tariffs would affect his business. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=43.68s)]
*  The last week has been a turbulent time, to say the least. We're a small company. We [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=50.32s)]
*  have less than 10 employees, under $5 million in revenue. And like you said, we make all [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=56.24s)]
*  of our products, all of our cut and sew products in Vietnam, and proudly so with factory partners [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=60.88s)]
*  and people that have been with us since the very beginning who took a risk on us and supported [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=65.86s)]
*  us early on. And now we've been partners with them ever since. We go to Vietnam regularly. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=70.4s)]
*  And so we have product ready to ship right now that we're asking the factory to hold [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=75.42s)]
*  onto while we see what clears up. We are cash strapped as a small business is and how many [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=79.32s)]
*  small businesses, including lots of the outdoor industry, is driven by these kind of smaller [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  brands. We don't really have the ability to weather a cycle like this if we do get hit [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=91.24s)]
*  with an additional 46% tariffs. So we're looking at all options. Our advisors, our board, our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  company, everybody I can speak to, and every other founder, we're just looking at what [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=102.52s)]
*  we can do to respond to this rather than react. But the uncertainty is hard, to say [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=105.92s)]
*  the least. I'm sure I completely appreciate that. Now, your suppliers in Vietnam, I presume [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=112.36s)]
*  you've spoken to them several times since it was announced these reciprocal tariffs [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=118.48s)]
*  could come into force. So what are they saying and how are they responding to all of this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=123.72s)]
*  Well look, we'd like to see this as a true partnership. And we're not making any demands [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=130.08s)]
*  of our suppliers at this point. I was just in Vietnam about a month ago, making sure [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=133.28s)]
*  that our relationship was strong and let them know that we were going to be with them as [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=137.56s)]
*  a long-term partner. And so we're taking a wait and see approach. A lot of this is in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=140.76s)]
*  the air, as you've mentioned, right? The uncertainty is hard. But Vietnam, there's been very active [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=146.16s)]
*  efforts on the side of the Vietnamese government to make conciliatory and reciprocal, I guess, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=152.0s)]
*  conciliations to the US to try to ease this burden on Vietnamese exporters and American [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=160.12s)]
*  importers, which is a lot of the outdoor industry, really. It's a significant amount of our apparel [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=165.44s)]
*  is built there. And there's some reason to believe that there'll be some relief, but [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=170.36s)]
*  we're just one small piece of a very, very global... [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=174.44s)]
*  If a deal isn't brokered between the US and Vietnam on trade and these tariffs remain [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=178.16s)]
*  in place, what will you then be forced to do? Will you have to pass on the cost to your [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=183.8s)]
*  customers, do you think? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=188.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, there's going to be no way around it. There are margins [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=191.4s)]
*  built into apparel, but we're not an excess profitable company, right? We don't have extra [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=196.0s)]
*  margin to absorb. And our factory is really in a similar situation. Our main factory is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=200.84s)]
*  a family-owned business with one factory. It's not a massive conglomerate and there's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  not a lot of margin there. And so we'll work with them to mitigate the harm and the risk [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=209.8s)]
*  to that, but eventually we'll have to raise prices. And we're not going to do anything [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=213.88s)]
*  that would sacrifice the quality of our product to do so. So we're discussing to some degree [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=218.84s)]
*  prices will have to come up if the tariffs stick. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bts1HFi7eRs&t=225.07999999999998s)]
