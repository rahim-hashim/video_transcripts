# 'Why I fled Saudi Arabia and sought asylum in the UK' - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 03, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98)
*  I was asked to leave the country because of the security situation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=0.0s)]
*  My father controlled my life due to the guardianship law. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=5.0s)]
*  I was vocal about my criticism to the Saudi government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=9.0s)]
*  I can't go back to Saudi now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=13.0s)]
*  They lied to me and said there was no security because I was not under protection. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=21.0s)]
*  For some, she is a hero. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=25.0s)]
*  For others, she should be punished. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=27.0s)]
*  But the Saudi teen Rahaf Al-Ghunun, who fled her family, barricaded herself in a Thai hotel room [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=29.0s)]
*  and was later drained to the asylum in Canada, is definitely not the only one. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=35.0s)]
*  The story of Rahaf Al-Ghunun has brought the world attention to the issue of Saudi runaway women. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=43.0s)]
*  Hundreds of them escape their families every year and seek freedom and safety in places like Canada, Australia and Europe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=49.0s)]
*  I've come here to meet a 19-year-old Saudi whose story sums up the reasons why those women leave everything behind and take this journey. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=56.0s)]
*  Rawan, who doesn't want to reveal her real name, told me she renounced Islam secretly over a year ago. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=70.0s)]
*  I was forced to practice rituals that I didn't believe in. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=77.0s)]
*  My father controlled my life due to the guardianship law. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=80.0s)]
*  My father dictated where I lived, where I studied and where I travelled. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=84.0s)]
*  I felt insulted as a woman to ask for the simplest things from him as my guardian. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=88.0s)]
*  Rawan tells me she was inspired by another Saudi young woman who fled to Canada last year. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=95.0s)]
*  I didn't know I could seek asylum as a Saudi. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=101.0s)]
*  Then I started researching only a month before I came to the UK. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=103.0s)]
*  I talked to a man on a website that helps Saudis trying to claim asylum. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=107.0s)]
*  He helped me with everything. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=111.0s)]
*  She was on a holiday with her family in the US and decided that the perfect moment to seek asylum would be in London, Heathrow Airport, as they were on transit on the way back to Saudi. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=115.0s)]
*  When we reached Heathrow, my family went to use the toilet. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=129.0s)]
*  I knew I had few minutes, so took the chance to hand over a note to a member of the airport staff. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=133.0s)]
*  The note said, I want to seek asylum. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=140.0s)]
*  When the police told my family, they tried to call me to make me change my mind, but I didn't pick up. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=145.0s)]
*  I was so afraid. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=152.0s)]
*  Many of those who decide to escape use online applications and a dedicated website to discreetly discuss escaping plans. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=158.0s)]
*  On this website, I found 300 Saudis who come here to seek advice on where to apply for asylum, the easiest escape routes, and how women can manipulate the guardianship system in order to travel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=165.0s)]
*  I've managed to reach out to a young woman who goes by the name Sara to hide her identity. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=178.0s)]
*  She told me she's planning to escape her family in the summer. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=184.0s)]
*  I've been planning for my escape for five years now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=191.0s)]
*  One way to get married so the husband would be my guardian. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=194.0s)]
*  I can then find a way to use his identity and get access to the permissions website. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=198.0s)]
*  Another way is to bribe someone in the airport or to convince my family that we travel abroad on a holiday. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=204.0s)]
*  On the website, I've also discovered that escaping is not exclusive to women. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=215.0s)]
*  Moad El-Ataibi, who also changed his real name, decided to flee Saudi because he could no longer voice his political and religious views. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=219.0s)]
*  My dad was very strict and used to abuse me physically and emotionally. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=228.0s)]
*  To the extent I had mental health problems. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=234.0s)]
*  I was vocal about my criticism to Saudi government and at one point I was recording a video of my father's death. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=238.0s)]
*  I was talking about politics which could have put my life in danger. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=246.0s)]
*  One day my family told me that they have chosen me a wife and that day I decided I have to leave. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=250.0s)]
*  I came to the UK and started my new life. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=256.0s)]
*  About nine out of ten I have helped last year were women. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=260.0s)]
*  I was a woman who was very much a part of the family. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=265.0s)]
*  About nine out of ten I have helped last year were women. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=269.0s)]
*  Abuse is one of the main reasons why they run. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=276.0s)]
*  Some of them have never traveled abroad. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=280.0s)]
*  So I explained to them the asylum-seeking procedure from the point they apply until they get the approval. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=283.0s)]
*  But I never give them financial support or accommodation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=291.0s)]
*  Those who couldn't make it were sent back to Saudi. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=299.0s)]
*  One of them is Dina Ali who was deported from the Philippines as she was on her way to Australia to seek asylum. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=304.0s)]
*  In all of the cases that we've been involved in when somebody got sent back to Saudi Arabia we lost touch. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=312.0s)]
*  And we never found out exactly what happened to them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=319.0s)]
*  And in such cases we have to fear the worst. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=322.0s)]
*  In the cases we've looked at, none of the women actually resurfaced. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=325.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has seen a lot of changes in the recent years. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=332.0s)]
*  Women now can drive, vote and be candidates for local elections. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=336.0s)]
*  But for some, this is not enough as long as the male guardianship exists. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=341.0s)]
*  Over two years ago women in Saudi have launched an online campaign calling to end the male guardianship. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=346.0s)]
*  The campaign is still ongoing on Twitter. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=352.0s)]
*  But not every woman agrees with. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=356.0s)]
*  I've been to Saudi Arabia many times in the last few years. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=359.0s)]
*  When I was there in 2016 to cover the male guardianship campaign, I met with Rawda Youssef, who is one of the biggest defenders of the guardianship system. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=362.0s)]
*  We are Arab and Muslim women. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=374.0s)]
*  Our rights are protected by our families. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=377.0s)]
*  Our rights are with our husbands, fathers and sons. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=379.0s)]
*  And there is nothing better than this. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=383.0s)]
*  Rawda and other women in Saudi haven't changed their views. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=386.0s)]
*  And consider those who are calling to end the guardianship rebels who should be punished. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=390.0s)]
*  Back in Cardiff, Rawan told me she now enjoys little things like going for window shopping. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=403.0s)]
*  Living with her family, Rawan would never want for anything. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=409.0s)]
*  Here in the UK, she gets $50 a week from the government and cannot buy many of the things she wants. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=412.0s)]
*  I did all of this to get the freedom that I never had before. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=420.0s)]
*  I never had authority over my life before. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=424.0s)]
*  Even the smallest of things like planning my day and deciding what to wear is precious. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=427.0s)]
*  I can't go back to Saudi now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=432.0s)]
*  She knows that her life here could be difficult. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=433.0s)]
*  But despite this, she says she will never think of going back to the conservative kingdom. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=436.0s)]
*  And then Razak, BBC News. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGG7qdCLc98&t=441.0s)]
