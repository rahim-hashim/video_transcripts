Video Description: Hospitals in Myanmar - many of which have been damaged by Fridayâ€™s earthquake - are overwhelmed by the surge of casualties, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.
 
At least three hospitals are completely out of service, while another 22 are "partially damaged and not really able to function", they said.
 
They have also warned that Myanmar's ruling military junta has previously been accused of withholding international aid to certain regions.
 
Around 1,700 people have died after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck close to Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, on Friday.

# Humanitarian crisis warning in Myanmar after deadly earthquake | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ)
*  It's now three days since Myanmar was struck by a huge 7.7 magnitude earthquake. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=0.0s)]
*  International humanitarian agencies are stepping up aid deliveries but are warning of a worsening [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=6.4s)]
*  humanitarian crisis in the Wantong country. The United Nations has made an urgent appeal for [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=12.32s)]
*  eight million dollars in aid with donations needed to deliver life-saving trauma care. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=19.28s)]
*  The World Health Organization says hospitals in the disaster zone are overwhelmed with injured [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=25.84s)]
*  people and there's a desperate need for all kinds of supplies. We know that more than 1,700 people [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=31.52s)]
*  have died and some 3,400 have been injured. Family members are waiting anxiously as rescue [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=38.72s)]
*  efforts continue in Myanmar and neighboring Thailand where a high-rise building that had [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=46.08s)]
*  been under construction in the capital Bangkok collapsed. Well this is the scene live in Bangkok [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=51.28s)]
*  where we know that rescue efforts are ongoing to try and locate the dozens of construction workers [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=57.2s)]
*  still buried under that rubble. In the last hour the Thai Prime Minister has visited the scene. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=62.96s)]
*  She's ordered an investigation questioning why that was the only building to crumble. Well let's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=68.4s)]
*  go live to our correspondent Nick Marsh who's in Bangkok. Nick we can see the pictures behind you [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=74.16s)]
*  but the international aid agencies really trying to ramp up the aid that's getting into Myanmar. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=80.08s)]
*  Yeah absolutely these two countries are bearing the bulk of the devastation from Friday's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=88.0s)]
*  earthquake. As you can see behind me the rescue operation here in Bangkok still very much continuing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  dozens of people as you say thought to still be buried under that mound of rubble. Thailand's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=100.4s)]
*  Prime Minister was here earlier she's confirmed that investigation that you mentioned as well [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=106.88s)]
*  but don't forget we are 800 miles away from the epicenter of the earthquake in Myanmar. The ruling [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=113.36s)]
*  military hunter isn't letting international journalists in for the journalists who are already [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=120.64s)]
*  in the country reporting from Myanmar can be risky they do face reprisals from the ruling military [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=126.64s)]
*  hunter nevertheless our colleagues for the BBC Burmese service have traveled more than 200 kilometres [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=134.16s)]
*  to get to the capital Naypyidaw and they've sent us this report. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=141.92s)]
*  Praying amongst the rubble for the victims of Friday's devastating earthquake. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=150.56s)]
*  Tears flowed for those who have died and those still missing. It's fear the death toll will continue to grow. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=154.56s)]
*  This is Naypyidaw, Myanmar's capital. It's just a few hundred kilometres from the epicenter of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=167.84s)]
*  where the deadly tremors struck. The smell of death hangs in the air around the damaged buildings. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=174.0s)]
*  There are many bodies that still haven't been recovered from the rubble. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=181.52s)]
*  Few people here are willing to speak to journalists due to the fear of reprisal from the Myanmar's military [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=188.72000000000003s)]
*  government but one woman told us how her family has been coping since the earthquake struck. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  At night we sleep in a wide open area but we can't sleep well because there are aftershocks every two or three hours. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=202.96s)]
*  We can't sleep or eat well. I'm just drinking water and feeling exhausted. We cannot expect to rebuild our lives to how they were under these circumstances. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  We may have to live in a slum. Nothing is left. Even now I can't afford to get food. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=218.8s)]
*  In these tents about 50 medical staff are treating 200 patients. There is a thousand vet hospital nearby [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=225.44s)]
*  but it's not safe to send people there. The entire emergency room has collapsed. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  My colleague Tend Nai Zob visited a large residential complex that housed civil servants. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=239.52s)]
*  The ground flu has completely sunk into the ground he says. The first, second and third [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=249.68s)]
*  flus are badly damaged. There are a number of bodies still under the rubble and the smell is quite bad. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=254.88s)]
*  International teams have been allowed in to help with rescue efforts so some help is reaching [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  affected areas but the UN has criticized the military junta for continuing to launch airstrikes [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=268.48s)]
*  on rebel groups after the earthquake struck. Those affected by this disaster will need help [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=275.36s)]
*  for many more days to come. So in turn BBC News. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=282.24s)]
*  So Nick that's the picture from Myanmar from our BBC Burmese colleagues. Where you are still a rescue [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=289.44s)]
*  operation but there are big questions about why that was the only building that collapsed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=294.96s)]
*  Yeah absolutely it's a different situation here in Thailand. I mean Bangkok by and large relatively [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=302.0s)]
*  speaking actually emerged largely unscathed. We've seen superficial damage to quite a few buildings [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  but nothing on the scale of this collapse that you can see behind me with big loss of life and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  an even bigger death toll feared. So understandably people here are asking questions well [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=323.68s)]
*  why was it this was the only building to have collapsed. It's not like this was the only [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=328.64s)]
*  construction site in Thailand. So as you've mentioned earlier the Prime Minister has been [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=332.4s)]
*  here she's been talking about an inquiry. Yesterday Thailand's industry minister actually visited the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=338.4s)]
*  site and said that there had been some irregularities noticed in the type of steel that had been used to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=344.8s)]
*  construct this building. Now clearly that requires more investigation. Some samples have been sent [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=351.44s)]
*  off to determine exactly what happened. There are still families here by the way Nicky gathered [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=359.2s)]
*  anxiously waiting for some kind of good news. They've told us that they're going to stay here [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=365.92s)]
*  for as long as it takes but as the hours go by and as the days go by we're into the fourth day [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=370.0s)]
*  now of this search and rescue operation. The fear is that it goes from a search and rescue operation [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=374.72s)]
*  to a search and recovery operation and then the focus inevitably turns into why exactly did this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=380.72s)]
*  construction collapse so quickly on Friday. Nick I know that the city itself is still nervous as [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=387.92s)]
*  you witnessed yourself earlier. Yeah it is. I mean we were on the way here actually to speak to you [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  and we noticed streams and streams of people coming out of office buildings easily hundreds [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=403.92s)]
*  maybe even more than a thousand. They were all lined up along the streets so we decided [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=410.32s)]
*  to get out of our car speak to them and they told us that some cracks had been spotted in their [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=414.8s)]
*  office buildings. It's Monday morning it's the first day back at work for a lot of people since [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=419.6s)]
*  the earthquake on Friday. Even one of my colleagues here I was speaking to him and his wife was told [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=424.32s)]
*  to get out of her apartment in her condominium building in another part of Bangkok. We're seeing [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=429.28s)]
*  these sporadic kind of evacuations in different kinds of buildings. There is superficial damage [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  so a lot of structures here cracks have appeared since Friday and there's nervousness around [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=439.35999999999996s)]
*  potential aftershocks. Any potential further damage this week. The authorities have stressed [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=446.64s)]
*  that Bangkok is safe. They're urging people not to panic but we've seen it for ourselves. People out [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=452.23999999999995s)]
*  onto the streets evacuating with or without any official notice. Then you can understand [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=458.08s)]
*  their ditterness can't you? Absolutely Nick Marsh live in Bangkok thank you very much. Well as we [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=463.2s)]
*  mentioned the United Nations has made an urgent appeal for eight million dollars for humanitarian [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=468.64s)]
*  aid. Let's speak to Margaret Harris who is the global spokesperson for the World Health [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  Organisation. Thank you very much for joining us on BBC News. What as far as you can tell is the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=478.08s)]
*  situation on the ground in Myanmar at the moment? So as you've reported very well there are huge [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=484.88s)]
*  numbers of casualties. A high in the death rate. Tenth toll is increasing as we speak [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=492.56s)]
*  and is much higher than is expected to be much higher than is currently reported. But [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=499.68s)]
*  the hospitals are overwhelmed. At least three of them are completely out of service. Three in the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  area I mean. And there are another 22 that are partially damaged. So not really able to function. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=512.08s)]
*  And they have great need for supplies and for people. So we have been able to deliver [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=518.72s)]
*  three tons of supplies into the area. And the other important thing is we also put out a call [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=525.2s)]
*  for emergency medical teams around the world. And we've had 20 different teams from around the world [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=530.72s)]
*  to say they are ready to come in as field hospitals to support this massive massive [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=536.16s)]
*  recovery. Well care. Massive need for the care of the people. And what are the main challenges [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  to you getting that aid in and what in particular is needed? So vast numbers of things. But the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=552.16s)]
*  immediate health needs are trauma and surgical care, blood, drugs, fusion supplies, anaesthetics and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=559.52s)]
*  essential medicines which we are bringing in. But also disease surveillance has to be strengthened [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=564.56s)]
*  to prevent outbreaks of cholera, dengue fever and other communicable diseases because with the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=569.92s)]
*  destruction of the water systems people are lacking food. There's a very very high risk that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=575.1199999999999s)]
*  there will be huge outbreaks. It's you know perfect conditions. People are stressed. People are [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=582.0799999999999s)]
*  terrified. People are hungry and they don't have access to clean water and they're completely [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  displaced from their homes. They also need their essential medicines, their standard medicines and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=591.2s)]
*  we've really got to continue essential health services because as you can imagine when an [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=595.84s)]
*  earthquake happens you don't have time to grab your diabetes medicine or your heart medicine. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=600.88s)]
*  So there are people who will need that care, who need that care right now. Are you concerned that [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=604.88s)]
*  aid won't get to all areas because the military in to control a lot of the control the country? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=610.08s)]
*  So it has always been a struggle. Now we've had been on the ground for many many years. We have an [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=616.4s)]
*  office in Myanmar and we have a team in Myanmar and that is always a struggle wherever conflict [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=622.64s)]
*  is going on. But again that's our work to negotiate those things and we work through what's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=628.64s)]
*  called a health cluster system. So we work with partners in those places who can reach people. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=633.36s)]
*  So it won't be easy but I think the hardest thing is actually the infrastructure. The destruction of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  the roads, the communications, the bridges just simply physically getting there. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=644.4s)]
*  And I assume now we're heading into hot season. There is now a big risk of disease in that country [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=651.84s)]
*  as well. You're absolutely right. In fact we've been battling a cholera outbreak since July 2024 [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=658.4s)]
*  and it's a big one. It's in many states. So indeed those problems will sort of superimpose. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=667.2s)]
*  Now that we've got this destruction the problems that were already there, which was an over-restrained [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=676.08s)]
*  health service, already problems with communicable diseases will just augment. So you're absolutely [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=681.6s)]
*  right. It will only get worse but we're there to do our best to prevent that. And are you optimistic [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=687.44s)]
*  that you are going to be able to get that aid in to the people who need it most, particularly around [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=694.08s)]
*  that epicentre? Well it's not going to be easy but we have got a lot of experience with dealing [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  with earthquakes unfortunately because we've seen many. I think the biggest struggle honestly and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=707.76s)]
*  that's why we put out a flash appeal for 8 million, we'll be getting the funding. The world at the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=712.96s)]
*  moment is focusing on harming each other rather than dealing with the harms that nature does to us. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FzX9WmPhQ&t=718.1600000000001s)]
