# How do Ukrainians see their path to peace? | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970)
*  Absolutely. Now, you just need to look at the, who is not on the guest list today at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=0.0s)]
*  this summit, America. This is about Ukraine's other allies working out how it is going to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=6.68s)]
*  plug a gap left by a White House that is, as you say, aligning with Moscow, adopting [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=14.36s)]
*  a far less sympathetic approach, in some cases hostile to its continued support for Ukraine [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=19.8s)]
*  and its support or endorsement really of Russia's invasions, such as been the shattering [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=25.72s)]
*  of its foreign policy. Now, President Zelensky has spoken. He's talked about Vladimir Putin [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=31.72s)]
*  not wanting to exchange something for peace. He's looking at summits like these for Ukraine [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=37.56s)]
*  and the countries around it to come up with its own proposal to counter what Russia is [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=44.16s)]
*  seeking to do. He's proposed a complete prisoner of war exchange to kick things off in this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=48.2s)]
*  peace process. It's been a rare area of cooperation between Ukraine and Russia, and he suggested [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=53.44s)]
*  that all POWs would be exchanged as a first stage. But these are uncertain times. We've [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  been speaking to Ukrainians here on how they see their path to peace. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=68.16s)]
*  Kiev's 120-year-old funicular. With two stops, it is the simplest of routes. What's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=75.16s)]
*  more complicated is where Ukraine is going in this war. Seemingly abandoned by its biggest [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=84.72s)]
*  ally, America, Donald Trump turned US support on its head by apparently siding with Russia. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=90.84s)]
*  Some people, they listen to Russia position, but many people understand us. I know many, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=98.76s)]
*  I have many friends from Europe that support Ukrainians. As Washington decides whether [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  to keep helping this country, there are internal divisions over how men are called up to fight. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=114.12s)]
*  Everyone should fight, except the sick, because if everyone had done that from the start and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  not hidden, we would have had peace for a long time already. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=127.0s)]
*  Ukrainians do want peace, but not at any price. It wants security guarantees that Russia won't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=133.88s)]
*  invade again. America, so far, is reluctant to give them. Dimkirn listed as a drone pilot [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=139.2s)]
*  last year. I ask him what impact the politics have had on him and his comrades. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=146.2s)]
*  To me personally, it doesn't change a thing. I'm still willing to defend my home. I know [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=152.04s)]
*  that if the United States will pull out all of the aid that they give to us, it's going [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=157.04s)]
*  to be just more deadly. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  Major cities like Kiev have kept functioning under the weight of Moscow's invasion. Here, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  a rail worker was killed after a Russian drone hit. There are blast sites like this every [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  day across Ukraine. Russia launches drones frequently, and they are designed to pressure [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=177.0s)]
*  the population. But why now is different is that it is also America applying its own pressure [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=182.84s)]
*  on Ukraine to accept its conditions for future help. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=189.5s)]
*  The force from the blast shattered the windows of Zoya's flat. She lives here with her elderly [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=195.52s)]
*  mum. She's anxious, so she prays every day for the war to end. But would she take the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=200.12s)]
*  quick peace Donald Trump wants? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=205.32s)]
*  Our country is our country, and it must remain ours. Giving up territories is wrong and unnecessary. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=209.12s)]
*  There has to be an agreement. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=217.04s)]
*  But what does that agreement look like? Ukraine and Europe aren't even at the negotiating [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  table, as they work out how to stand up to Russia without America for the first time [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=225.0s)]
*  since the Second World War. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=230.64s)]
*  We're hearing a lot about an American proposal to get access to Ukraine's natural minerals. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  Washington wants the rights to $500 billion worth of Ukraine's minerals in exchange for [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=241.48s)]
*  the military help it's given in the past and what it would provide in the future. It's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=249.48s)]
*  very much a transactional approach. And President Zelensky is resisting. He's saying he's not [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  going to sell his state. He's saying it would lay his country with a debt that would be [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=258.64s)]
*  paid off for generations. And so that is why I think we're seeing an increasingly hostile [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=263.44s)]
*  tone from the White House aimed at Ukraine's leader. But the impression you get here is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=268.96s)]
*  that he would not sign something, a ceasefire agreement or a contract like this, if he felt [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=273.4s)]
*  it didn't represent the best interests of his country. And if he does turn that down [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=281.44s)]
*  and America turns its attention elsewhere or aligns with Moscow further and Europe isn't [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=286.24s)]
*  able to step up, then the consequences for the future of this country, the surrounding [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=292.88s)]
*  region could be far reaching. And that is why we are seeing world leaders here today [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=296.92s)]
*  to try and in some way answer that question. But at the moment there is still the agreement [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=302.52s)]
*  that Europe needs America to be a military safety net. The UK and France are meeting [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=307.6s)]
*  Donald Trump this week to try and bridge a widening gap. But at the moment there are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=313.08s)]
*  a lot of scratching heads. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGQE2uZt970&t=318.88s)]
