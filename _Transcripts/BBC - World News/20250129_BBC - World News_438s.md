**BBC - World News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk)
*  An American Airlines flight has collided mid-air with a helicopter, a military helicopter, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=0.0s)]
*  in Washington DC. The US Federal Aviation Administration said it happened whilst on [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=8.4s)]
*  approach to runway 33 at Reagan Washington National Airport at around 9pm local time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=14.8s)]
*  The jet, we understand, was carrying 60 passengers and four crew, whilst three US Army soldiers [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=23.98s)]
*  were on board the Black Hawk military helicopter. President Donald Trump says that he's been [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=32.9s)]
*  briefed on what he has described as the terrible accident and went on to thank emergency responders [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  for their incredible work. Police divers and boats have been searching the water now for [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=48.26s)]
*  a number of hours looking for survivors, whilst the US Federal authorities have begun their [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=55.26s)]
*  investigation. Okay, let's cross to our correspondent live from the scene, Merlin Thomas. Merlin, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=62.9s)]
*  you're there. First off, just take us through the timeline of what happened. So what we know is that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=72.46s)]
*  a commercial airline, the American Airlines, collided mid-air with an Army Black Hawk helicopter [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  and as you said there were 60 passengers on board the commercial airline as well as four crew members [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=91.5s)]
*  and there were also three soldiers on board the helicopter as well and just in the last few minutes [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=97.7s)]
*  as well we've seen reports that at least 18 bodies were recovered from the river, that's according [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=103.54s)]
*  to our official partners, CBS, but just to say there is no official update on the number of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=110.18s)]
*  casualties as of yet and this is still a developing story. But that collision occurred here at around [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=116.62s)]
*  9 p.m. local time and it happened mid-air and it happened as the commercial airline was on its [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=124.46s)]
*  approach to runway 33 and the scene that you can see behind me is the airport itself. So you can see [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=131.58s)]
*  the blue and red sirens behind me and the blackness to my left and that is the river as you can see here [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=139.26s)]
*  and there is a flurry of activity as the emergency operation is underway. We know that there are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=146.54s)]
*  emergency divers and police boats and emergency rescue operations very much underway but just [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=153.9s)]
*  to remind you it's midnight here local time and so it's extremely cold and it's dark and that will [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=160.38s)]
*  make that rescue operation all that much harder and you know we're constantly seeing more and more [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=166.3s)]
*  official police cars and emergency responders arriving at this airport and we are expecting to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=172.94s)]
*  hear a press conference in about half an hour and we'll expect more updates regularly throughout [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=179.26000000000002s)]
*  the night as well. Okay Merlin let's just go back to the the crash itself. I understand that there [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=184.78s)]
*  has been some audio that's been released from air traffic control. We are waiting for more information [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=192.62s)]
*  on that but what have eyewitnesses described in the minutes leading up to that crash? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=201.18s)]
*  We've spoken to people here at the scene and they didn't want to be named but one did tell [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  me that they actually witnessed the moment of the collision itself so they saw the fireball [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=218.06s)]
*  of the collision itself and it was a bright orange in the sky and then it fell down into [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  what this person thought was the river and he heard a loud boom sound as the collision happened [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=230.54s)]
*  and he described to me how scared and terrified he was that he wanted to fall to his knees just [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=238.14s)]
*  watching the moment happen before him. He couldn't quite believe his eyes and so there's very much a [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=243.66s)]
*  lot of confusion here and people have been arriving at the airport and trying to find out [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=250.54s)]
*  what's happening. Some people who have arrived expecting their loved ones to arrive on other [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=254.7s)]
*  flights which have now been rerouted to other airports. All flights have been ground to a halt [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=260.38s)]
*  here. There are no flights taking off or landing here at all in the next few hours at least that we [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=267.02s)]
*  know of but we'll expect to hear more updates as we go through the night more regularly. Okay so [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=272.94s)]
*  let me just reiterate what Merlin has told us. There is a ground stop. It's referred to as a ground [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=279.74s)]
*  stop. This is a traffic management initiative which means that aircraft that meet specific criteria [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  need to remain on the ground at their origination airport. So there is a ground stop [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=293.74s)]
*  in place at Reagan National Airport. No flights coming in, no flights coming out. Merlin there [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=301.82s)]
*  are two helicopters that are operating in the area and this is part of the search and rescue [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  that is taking place at the moment. What exactly are those helicopters doing? What can you see [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=316.62s)]
*  them doing? They have I presume very bright spotlights on board. What have you seen? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=321.42s)]
*  Yeah I can hear them whirring above me now. You can hear that sound and they are just monitoring [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=327.5s)]
*  the situation and we know that there are lots and lots of emergency responders on site, dozens of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=332.38s)]
*  fire trucks and police attending to the scene as well as divers which have been sent from neighboring [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=337.34s)]
*  states like Maryland as well which are part of the rescue operation and we also know that the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=344.3s)]
*  US Coast Guard is also involved in this operation as well and this was a very important step [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=350.3s)]
*  in the rescue operation as well and this will be a massive operation and it will be made all the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=355.82s)]
*  more difficult by the fact that it is extremely cold here. The temperature is cold even in the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=361.02s)]
*  air and so it will be even colder in the water as well where this rescue operation is ongoing [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=366.14s)]
*  as we speak. Yeah I mean it's only a matter of a week or just over a week that we had the inauguration [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=372.3s)]
*  of Donald Trump and because of that truly frigid weather it was moved indoors. What are the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=378.78s)]
*  conditions like along the river itself at the moment? Was it frozen over the Potomac River? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=384.54s)]
*  Upstream it is frozen in parts. Here it's hard to see because it's so dark. It's just past [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=393.58000000000004s)]
*  midnight, it's very dark here and as I say it is very cold and so those rescue divers and this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=399.58000000000004s)]
*  police will be operating in very frigid cold conditions and as you said we've had a spell [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=405.82000000000005s)]
*  of that here in DC and that is exactly what prompted the inauguration to be moved indoors [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=411.18s)]
*  and so you know the city is just recovering from that and so there will be some of the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=416.86s)]
*  river will still be frozen over. We've seen elsewhere some of the tidal basin other bodies [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=421.1s)]
*  of water in the city here are still frozen over and you know just it was just a few days ago [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=425.98s)]
*  that there was still snow and ice on these streets as well so the temperatures are very cold and the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=431.02s)]
*  conditions are very difficult. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DchvYJxfk&t=437.02s)]
