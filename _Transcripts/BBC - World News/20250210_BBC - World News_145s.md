Video Description: Ecuador's presidential election will go to a second round after a closely contested first-round result failed to produce an outright winner.
 
The electoral authorities called it a "technical tie" after the incumbent centre-right candidate, Daniel Noboa, and his main left-wing challenger Luisa Gonz√°lez received nearly identical percentages of the vote.
 
The pair will now face a run-off in April.
 
The result is far narrower than opinion polls had predicted, indicating the second round could be harder to call.

# Ecuador election ends in a 'tie' prompting run-off | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM)
*  Ecuador's presidential election will go to a second round after a closely contested first round result failed to produce an outright winner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=0.0s)]
*  The electoral authorities called it a technical tie after the incumbent centre-right candidate Daniel Nuboa and his main left-wing challenger Luisa Gonzalez received nearly identical percentages of the vote. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=9.0s)]
*  The pair will now face a run-off in April. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=21.0s)]
*  Well, let's cross live and speak to Cristobal Samadic, a senior analyst for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Economist Intelligence Unit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=24.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. It's good to talk to you. Just talk to me first of all what this now means going forward for these elections. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=32.0s)]
*  Thank you for your time and having us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=39.0s)]
*  So right now we're facing a run-off as you mentioned and there are stark policy agendas, a stark contrast in the policy agenda of Daniel Nuboa and of Luisa Gonzalez. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=43.0s)]
*  So the country would be headed in a much, in a very different direction depending on who wins, both on the fiscal, economic and even social and security wise. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=55.0s)]
*  So how do they differ? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=66.0s)]
*  So I think Daniel Nuboa will probably continue his business friendly agenda, whereas Luisa Gonzalez, who follows on the steps of her mentor and the former president Rafael Corroa, would thoroughly push Ecuador on a much more left-wing agenda. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=68.0s)]
*  At stake, we would probably see a difference between a statelet growth versus a more business friendly economy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=84.0s)]
*  And in terms of this election, for many it was seen as a referendum, wasn't it, on areas of Nuboa's presidency, including his controversial approach to domestic security? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=92.0s)]
*  Indeed. And I still think the election result, even though he didn't win at first round, that some people were expecting to, is still quite solid given the magnitude of the challenges. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=104.0s)]
*  People are still favoring his populist, tough on crime approach despite homicide rates creeping up again. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=116.0s)]
*  Now his challenge will be definitely to widen his voting base and be able to captivate other voters who voted for other parties and be able to energize his voting base. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=123.0s)]
*  Okay, Cristobal, it's good to talk to you. Thank you so much, senior analyst for Latin America and the Caribbean. Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3Nv-BbqxM&t=137.0s)]
