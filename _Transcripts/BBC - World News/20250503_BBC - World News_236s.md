Video Description: Labor's Anthony Albanese has defied the so-called "incumbency curse" to be re-elected Australia's prime minister in a landslide.
Official vote counting won't finish for days, but Albanese's centre-left government will dramatically increase its majority after the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide.
"Today, the Australian people have voted for Australian values: for fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all; for the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need," Albanese said.
Coalition leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of 24 years, said he accepted "full responsibility" for his party's loss and apologised to his MPs.

# Australia PM Albanese makes comeback with landslide win | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y)
*  Let's go back to Australia because Anthony Albanese, the country's Prime Minister, has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=0.0s)]
*  won re-election. His opponent Peter Dutton conceded defeat in the vote, which has been [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=4.88s)]
*  overshadowed by Donald Trump's policy on tariffs. The results make Anthony Albanese the first [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=9.78s)]
*  Prime Minister in 21 years to secure two consecutive victories. He has promised to embrace renewable [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=16.06s)]
*  energy and to improve Australia's healthcare system. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=23.42s)]
*  My colleague Georgia Terry is monitoring all of this for us. So just talk us through how [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=27.98s)]
*  expected was this result? I mean, slightly expected, but not by this massive margin. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=32.18s)]
*  No, the results are actually really interesting coming out of Australia. You know, going into [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=37.1s)]
*  election day, the polls had Labour winning. But I don't think that people thought it would [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=42.9s)]
*  be by this much. Now, just to give you a little bit of a snapshot of this, the ABC, which [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=48.22s)]
*  is our broadcasting partner in Australia, has a predicted 85 seats to the Labour Party. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=54.059999999999995s)]
*  Now, to get a majority government, that has to be about 76 seats. So they've well and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  truly reached that. But not only that, we had Peter Dutton not just losing this election, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=65.3s)]
*  but he also lost his seat, which would be a major blow for the Conservatives, particularly [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=71.34s)]
*  because going into this, they were leading in the polls at the start of this campaign. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=76.74s)]
*  And I think what wasn't necessarily expected was this kind of Trump factor, the looming [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=83.94s)]
*  spectre of Trump in the background. And we saw Peter Dutton really campaigning on this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=89.82s)]
*  like Trump-like platform, where it kind of worked for him initially. But then as there [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=95.02s)]
*  was more uncertainty in Trump's 100 days, tariffs started coming through. Australian [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=102.38s)]
*  voters were really questioning, do we want this? And at the same time, we had this flip [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=107.33999999999999s)]
*  side where Anthony Albanese was really gaining momentum and he was announcing policies that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  were really, really, really attractive to that key votership that they needed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=117.22s)]
*  So he's now got to fulfil on those policies. What happens next? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=122.74s)]
*  So basically exactly what you said, they really need to fulfil these promises that they said [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=125.94s)]
*  with these cost of living policies that they came up with, which were really popular with [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  the Australian public. But I think when it comes to the Conservatives, they're in rebuild [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=137.74s)]
*  mode. They really have to look at where they are sitting now. They need a new leader. They [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=142.82s)]
*  need a new strategy. Where will they go with this? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=147.06s)]
*  Another factor that we're looking at with the two parties, both of them facing this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=150.86s)]
*  problem is that about one third of Australians voted for an independent or a smaller party. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=155.22s)]
*  So they'll be looking at that going, why did we lose those voters, that one third of Australians [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=161.62s)]
*  who don't engage with the two major political parties? And I think what they'll be doing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=167.3s)]
*  there is analysing how they can bring those voters back. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  And so how does it now feed into the fact that this is the first time, and this is absolutely [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  fascinating, the first time that the Gen Z and the millennial voters outnumbered the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=180.22s)]
*  baby boomers? What do we read into that? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=184.62s)]
*  This was such an interesting campaign because we had both these two major political parties, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=187.26s)]
*  these two leaders really looking at the youth vote. We had the Conservatives putting out [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=194.38s)]
*  diss tracks against Labour. We had Anthony Albanese appearing on all these podcasts, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=200.54s)]
*  trying to target the youth vote and the youth voice. And I think that really cut through [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=206.78s)]
*  when it came to Labour. But what needs to happen now is that Anthony Albanese really [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  needs to continue that and kind of galvanise that force of young voters if he wants to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=217.1s)]
*  remain as a popular Prime Minister. Absolutely fascinating, isn't it? Georgia [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=223.74s)]
*  Terry, thank you so much for bringing all of that to us and talking us through it. Georgia, thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DswaD9FW39Y&t=229.58s)]
