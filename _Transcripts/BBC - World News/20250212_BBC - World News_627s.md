Video Description: Egypt says it plans to present a “comprehensive vision" for the reconstruction of Gaza that does not involve displacing the population, unlike a proposal put forward by US President Donald Trump.
 
In a statement, Egypt’s foreign ministry said they had an "aspiration" to work with the Trump administration on its plan, but stressed that any foreign intervention should "avoid jeopardising the gains of peace.”
 
There are fears that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could end this weekend after Hamas said it would delay the planned hostage release.
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said: “If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end.”
 
Netanyahu did not specify whether he was demanding the release of all 76 remaining hostages, or just the three due to be freed this Saturday - but an Israeli minister said he meant "everyone".
 
Hamas responded by saying it remained committed to the ceasefire deal and that Israel was "responsible for any complications or delays".

# Egypt to present ‘comprehensive vision’ for Gaza reconstruction | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8)
*  Now, Egypt says it will present a comprehensive vision for the reconstruction of Gaza that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=0.0s)]
*  will not involve the displacement of Palestinians. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=5.26s)]
*  It follows President Trump's meeting with the King of Jordan on Tuesday, where he doubled [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=8.46s)]
*  down on his plan for the US to take over the Gaza Strip and evict the entire population [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=12.36s)]
*  into neighbouring Arab countries. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=17.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's fear the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could end this weekend, after [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=19.2s)]
*  Hamas said it would delay this weekend's planned hostage release. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=24.66s)]
*  Here's our North America correspondent, Peter Beaus. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=28.1s)]
*  Close allies they may be, but these two men have very different visions for Gaza's future. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=32.38s)]
*  King Abdullah and Donald Trump met for the first time since the US president announced [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=39.1s)]
*  his plan to take over Gaza and move its population of more than two million Palestinians to other [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=43.38s)]
*  countries in the region, including Jordan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  It's going to be where we ultimately choose as a group. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=52.2s)]
*  I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=56.0s)]
*  I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=59.6s)]
*  We may have some place else, but I think when we finish our talks, we'll have a place where [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=62.68s)]
*  they're going to live very happily and very safely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=68.4s)]
*  The UN has warned that any forced displacement of civilians from occupied territory is strictly [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=72.68s)]
*  prohibited under international law and tantamount to ethnic cleansing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=78.72s)]
*  Mr. Trump insists his plan will bring stability to the Middle East. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=85.2s)]
*  Sitting by his side but walking a fine line between his view and that of the president, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=90.16s)]
*  King Abdullah said he was looking to Egypt for a way forward. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  I think one of the things that we can do right away is take 2,000 children that are either [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  cancer children or in very ill state to Jordan as quickly as possible and then wait for, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=106.08s)]
*  I think, the Egyptians to present their plan on how we can work with the president to work [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=113.2s)]
*  on the cancer challenges. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Egypt has said it would work with the Trump administration, but any foreign intervention [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  should avoid jeopardising the gains of peace. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  The ceasefire, meanwhile, between Hamas and Israel is looking increasingly fragile. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=128.96s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has welcomed President Trump's call for it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=134.24s)]
*  to be cancelled if Hamas fails to release hostages on Saturday, although it's not clear [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=138.96s)]
*  whether he means all hostages, as Mr. Trump demanded. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=144.56s)]
*  This operation is being carried out at this time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  It will be completed in the very near future. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  The decision that I passed unanimously in the cabinet is this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=154.0s)]
*  If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end and the military [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=157.24s)]
*  will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=164.8s)]
*  Responding to the Prime Minister's ultimatum, Hamas issued a statement renewing its commitment [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  to the ceasefire and accusing Israel of jeopardising it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=175.56s)]
*  Peter Beaux, BBC News. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  Let's get more reaction on that story. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=182.56s)]
*  We can go live to Jerusalem and join our Middle East correspondent Yolan now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=184.02s)]
*  Yolan, we saw in that report there the differences that are now emerging. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  What can we expect in the days to come before the weekend that might move the needle on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=194.14s)]
*  these differences? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=199.1s)]
*  I think this is now the time for regional mediators to really step in, try to clarify [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=200.1s)]
*  exactly what is required by Israel, try to put pressure on Hamas too to get things back [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=208.33999999999997s)]
*  on the right track, certainly for the initial stage of this ceasefire deal. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=214.98s)]
*  We are looking now more than three weeks into this initial six-week phase. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=220.06s)]
*  This is the most delicate that the ceasefire really has been. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=225.38s)]
*  It's still quite a little puzzling exactly what was the result of that Security Cabinet [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=231.06s)]
*  meeting yesterday. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=237.82s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister in his video statement, he came out saying there had been a unanimous [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=240.54s)]
*  decision reached and that was that Hamas has to return what he said were our hostages [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=246.14s)]
*  by noon on Saturday, otherwise the ceasefire would end. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=252.26s)]
*  But it's been pointed out he didn't say all our hostages, echoing what President Trump's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=257.26s)]
*  language was when he recommended this high stakes ultimatum to Hamas. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=262.46s)]
*  That would mean all the hostages, potentially all 76, still held by Hamas, both alive and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=268.14s)]
*  dead in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=275.70000000000005s)]
*  He could have meant the hostages that were already scheduled to be released this Saturday, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  three by Hamas under the existing terms of the deal that Hamas had said it was freezing [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  because of these alleged violations of the ceasefire agreement. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=291.5s)]
*  Israeli media is saying although there have been key ministers coming out, there have [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=299.62s)]
*  been briefings that were given to them by a senior Israeli official saying that the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=303.74s)]
*  intention is, the demand is for all of the hostages to come back. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  Many analysts are saying that Mr Netanyahu doesn't appear to have closed the door on [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=314.38s)]
*  some kind of way of keeping this deal going. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=319.5s)]
*  Yolande, with the very latest from Jerusalem, thank you very much for bringing us up to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=323.62s)]
*  date. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=329.1s)]
*  Let's discuss that a little bit further. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=330.1s)]
*  I'm joined now by Mustafa Kamel Al Said, professor of political science and director of the Centre [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=331.78s)]
*  of Study of Developing Countries at Cairo University. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=338.06s)]
*  Welcome to BBC News. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=342.78s)]
*  There's quite a lot to get through. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=344.18s)]
*  I want to just start by asking you whether you think the ceasefire in your assessment [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=346.26s)]
*  might fall apart by the weekend? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=351.38s)]
*  I think this is a delicate moment for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and for the U.S. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=354.9s)]
*  President Donald Trump. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=361.94s)]
*  It is a delicate moment because he, President, Prime Minister Netanyahu is under strong pressure [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  in Israel from the families of the hostages to continue the deal. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=373.74s)]
*  Also, President Trump is facing a very awkward situation because he was proud of the fact [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=379.3s)]
*  that he brought the ceasefire even before he came to the White House. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=387.1s)]
*  So ending the ceasefire now means more pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister and a big disappointment [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=391.42s)]
*  for President Donald Trump. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=397.78000000000003s)]
*  What is missing is that nobody is talking about what Hamas is demanding. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=400.58000000000004s)]
*  Hamas in fact is demanding that Israel adheres to the terms of this ceasefire, which requires [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=405.34s)]
*  Israel not to shoot at Palestinians, which requires Israel also to facilitate the delivery [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=410.73999999999995s)]
*  of aid to people in Gaza. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=416.82s)]
*  And this is something which is not claimed by Hamas without any foundation, but this [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=419.9s)]
*  is also confirmed by UN observers and many other sources. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=425.53999999999996s)]
*  And I think it would not be too much of the Israeli Prime Minister to accept these demands, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=430.58s)]
*  simply to adhere to the terms of the ceasefire. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=437.38s)]
*  Otherwise, I think it would be, again, ferocious, savage war on Palestinians who cannot tolerate [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  any more casualties and any more destruction of Gaza. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=451.46s)]
*  OK, and of course, there are differences of opinion on who is to blame for this ceasefire [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=457.06s)]
*  potentially stalling. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=463.02s)]
*  Let me ask you about this, Go, because you're speaking to us from Egypt. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=464.54s)]
*  Egypt now saying that it's going to be presenting a comprehensive vision for the reconstruction [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=468.58s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=474.86s)]
*  What does that look like to you? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=476.58s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, I would like to say that both Egypt, Qatar and the United States are [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=478.3s)]
*  engaged now in mediating between Hamas and Israel so that the ceasefire will continue. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=484.41999999999996s)]
*  As far as Egyptian ideas about the reconstruction of Gaza, I don't know the details, but I know [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=490.02s)]
*  that a certain number of Egyptian construction companies were consulted about this. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=497.82s)]
*  And the idea of the Egyptian government is that the reconstruction of Gaza could continue [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=505.29999999999995s)]
*  while people of Gaza are there. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=510.7s)]
*  I think this is not impossible. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=512.7s)]
*  The Israelis have forced the inhabitants of Gaza to move to safe areas. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=514.42s)]
*  So I don't think it would be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=520.1s)]
*  to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=527.26s)]
*  And there are some innovative ideas coming from Egyptian experts, well-known Egyptian [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=533.3s)]
*  experts on matters of reconstruction, city planning, et cetera, is proposing that the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=539.86s)]
*  debris could be used, in fact, in rebuilding. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  So instead of throwing away the debris, which resulted from Israeli raids on Gaza, they [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=549.62s)]
*  could be reused in the reconstruction. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=557.58s)]
*  But I think the details are not known. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=560.86s)]
*  But the important thing is that the reconstruction of Gaza will continue while the Palestinians [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=563.1s)]
*  in Gaza remain there. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=569.02s)]
*  So there will be, you know, Egypt completely rejects this idea that, you know, Gazans should [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=570.26s)]
*  go away while reconstruction is going on and with no promise for them to come back. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=577.5s)]
*  So I think Egypt is completely opposed to this idea and is insisting that the reconstruction [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=583.86s)]
*  could continue while people of Gaza are there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  And I guess also, you know, definitely Arab Gulf countries would be involved in this reconstruction process. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=591.94s)]
*  OK, OK. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=599.7s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mustafa Kamel Al Said. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=601.4200000000001s)]
*  Mustafa, they're talking about the reconstruction of Gaza. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=603.7800000000001s)]
*  We do have shots that show you Gaza live. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0itVEp_TOW8&t=606.22s)]
