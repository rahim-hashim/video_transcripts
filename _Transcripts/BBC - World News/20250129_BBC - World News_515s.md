Video Description: UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has confirmed that the government is officially backing plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport.
 
Reeves said the runway is “badly needed’ and could create 100,000 jobs at the London airport.
 
The plans received parliamentary approval in June 2018, but have been stuck in limbo after legal challenges ever since.
 
Reeves invited Heathrow to submit plans to expand the airport, but promised the government would only sign them off if "in line with legal environmental and climate objectives".

# UK chancellor backs London Heathrow Airport third runway | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4)
*  Let's start right here in the UK where Chancellor Rachel Reeves has just given a major speech [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=0.0s)]
*  on her plans to grow the country's economy. Let's get straight to the main points. Rachel [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=5.36s)]
*  Reeves has given the green light to a third runway at Heathrow Airport saying it was badly [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=11.58s)]
*  needed and would create at least 100,000 jobs. Moving on to GDP. The Chancellor says the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=17.32s)]
*  government has changed course on public investment, spending 2.6% of GDP on average over the next [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=23.58s)]
*  five years compared to 1.9% planned by the previous governments. Reeves said this would [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=31.18s)]
*  deliver an additional £100 billion of growth, enhancing capital spending. Anne Reeves is [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=36.46s)]
*  hoping to create Europe's Silicon Valley, restating the claim that the Oxford-Cambridge [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=42.94s)]
*  growth corridor could add £78 billion to the size of the economy by 2030. Our business [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=47.64s)]
*  correspondent Theo Leggett joins us live from Heathrow now. Theo, so the deadline for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=54.34s)]
*  proposals to get this Heathrow runway underway is this summer. You've been covering this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=60.08s)]
*  drama for over 20 years. How significant is this announcement for UK exports and jobs? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=65.6s)]
*  It's a very significant statement of intent, Mark, but it's unlikely to reap economic rewards [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=75.52s)]
*  for some time. And that's because this is a colossal project. It's expected to cost [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=80.52s)]
*  somewhere in the region of £20 billion, $25 billion. It requires an awful lot of work, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=85.6s)]
*  including the destruction of some 750 houses, a motorway being put into a tunnel, the construction [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  of a new terminal, and of course the new runway as well. And those proposals in the summer, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  they're just going to be the start. After that, there's a whole planning procedure [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=105.14s)]
*  to be gone through, and then there may be legal challenges which could cause further [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=108.42s)]
*  delay, and then once you get spades in the ground, well, it's about a seven-year project. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=112.84s)]
*  So this is a powerful statement of intent about where the government wants to go and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=117.52s)]
*  how it's open for investment and it's wanting to focus on growth and business, but the rewards [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=122.16s)]
*  are some way down the line. Yeah, I guess a 10-year-old today would only be able to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=128.52s)]
*  land on that new runway when they are 20, for example. But do you think the Chancellor [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=132.34s)]
*  has underestimated the scale of the legal and environmental challenges you mentioned? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=137.76s)]
*  I think she has to be very, very well aware of them, because as you said in your introduction, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=146.12s)]
*  this project has been on the table for the best part of two decades. A previous Labour [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=151.1s)]
*  administration in 2009 threw its weight behind a third runway at Heathrow. Nothing happened. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  There was an airports commission in 2015 that recommended a third runway at Heathrow as [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  the solution to congestion in Britain's skies and on the ground, but nothing's happened. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  It's been official government policy in Britain through what's called the Airports National [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  Policy Statement since 2018, but nothing's happened. And all the way through this, there [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  have been legal challenges, including one to the Supreme Court brought by environmentalists. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=183.44s)]
*  And the environmental argument is a very powerful one, that you shouldn't be encouraging the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=189.1s)]
*  expansion of aviation at a time when you're trying to cut emissions and meet a net zero [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  target of 2050. So it's impossible that the Chancellor doesn't know the kind of opposition [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  she's going to face and the kind of legal hurdles that are going to have to be gone [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  through. And that's what makes it, if you like, a powerful statement. She's saying there's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=209.68s)]
*  been failure in the past. This proposal has been on the table for a very long time. Now [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  she thinks she's going to get down and get it done. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=219.04s)]
*  All right, Theo Leggett, live in Heathrow. Thank you. For much of Rachel Reeves' speech, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=222.04s)]
*  she was talking about economic growth and net zero going forward hand in hand. Well, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=226.32s)]
*  I've been speaking to Lord Brown, who ran All Giant GP for many years and now heads [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=230.64s)]
*  up an investment fund focusing on green technology. He told me Heathrow and other UK airports [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=235.2s)]
*  do need to be expanded, but it must be done with the transition to net zero in mind. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  So you clearly need to increase infrastructure and that would mean increasing the scope and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=247.48s)]
*  scale of Heathrow, provided that all the infrastructure around it is commensurately upscaled. You [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=253.0s)]
*  can't have an airport not connected properly to the rest of the country. So I think that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=261.0s)]
*  is very important indeed. I think aviation as a whole is going to undergo several different [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=267.28s)]
*  transformations probably in the next 30 to 50 years. I very much hope that we can engineer [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=277.28s)]
*  fuels that the aeroplanes can use long haul, which have low carbon or zero carbon. The [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=285.28s)]
*  so-called sustainable aviation fuels, the way they're made at the moment, it cannot [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=295.0s)]
*  be scaled up properly. There has to be some breakthroughs and that's the sort of thing [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=300.44s)]
*  that the UK could work on. More on that interview with Lord Brown on talking business this weekend [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  here on BBC News. Well, sticking with the Chancellor's speech, we're now joined by [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=311.0s)]
*  Jordan Cummins, Chief Policy and Campaigns Officer at the CBI. Great to have you back [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=315.2s)]
*  because this morning, Jordan, you were telling us that you were looking for big, bold signals [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  for UK business and overseas investors from this very speech. Did you get them? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  I think so. You know, think about what the Chancellor stood up and said. Now is the time [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=331.55999999999995s)]
*  for growth to become the absolute central priority for this government. And I think [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=336.0s)]
*  this element of bravery, it's important to take net zero into consideration. Absolutely. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=341.2s)]
*  No one is suggesting that you wouldn't. But knowing that the government really wants to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=345.56s)]
*  go further and faster, I think the best things to reach for are those big, big signals. And [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=349.72s)]
*  you know, Heathrow is just one of those, but it definitely shows the ambition of this government [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  to be brave on growth. What was the thing that stood out most for [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  you in the speech then? When it came to Heathrow, we've just heard the London Mayor Sadiq Khan [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=362.88s)]
*  coming out against it. What stood out for you? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=366.64s)]
*  Well, a mixture. You know, Heathrow is a big international signal. You know, it's our hub [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=370.0s)]
*  airport in the UK. And so of course that stood out. But also the sense from the Chancellor [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  that skills and innovation and a sense of place are also equally important and making [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  the industrial strategy work is central to this. You know, Heathrow is obviously one thing, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  but it's not just about that. There's lots of enabling things that the Chancellor has [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  available to her to do. And I think she's really tried to spell out some of those wider [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  priorities today, too. So the balance stood out for me, which was nice. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  There was a focus on trade with America, India and resetting relations with the EU. There [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=399.4s)]
*  are going to be a lot of talking points coming out of what she said there. How did that go [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  down, do you think, amongst your members? Well, this is one of the big questions for [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  boardrooms right now. This triangulation between America, the EU and the UK and where we get [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=412.67999999999995s)]
*  to on trade. Tariffs are the big thing in people's minds at the moment, but it goes [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=418.44s)]
*  way beyond that. And so I think this is going to be a long term play across this year for [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  the government. So the more they can roll the pitch on the fact that they are willing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  to roll up their sleeves and take some of these trade-offs, perhaps, that you might [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  have between the US and the EU seriously, that's what business leaders want to hear. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=432.44s)]
*  They want to see government approach this in the same way as a business approaches it, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=436.32s)]
*  with pragmatism and openness. And so I think that sense really came across. So that was [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=439.96s)]
*  nice to see from the Chancellor. Sounds like you're very happy with the change of tone. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=443.96s)]
*  However, we saw the pound dip against major currencies as the Chancellor started [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=447.72s)]
*  speaking, suggesting a lack of confidence in the UK plans. Many of them, of course, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=452.48s)]
*  were touted earlier before she started speaking. So she wants to kickstart economic [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=456.48s)]
*  growth, but it sounds like the rest of the world is quite dubious about her plans. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=461.88000000000005s)]
*  Well, this is a tough gig, let's be honest. You know, running a country is difficult [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  and there's lots of levers available to the Chancellor. It's not all about kind of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  fiscal policy and industrial policy. Some of them are about signals to investors. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=475.0s)]
*  Some of them are about stability in the regulatory system. You know, the basket of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=479.36s)]
*  things that people look at in the UK for deciding to invest here. We are trying to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=483.24s)]
*  bite them off one by one and the government will know that they can't do it all at once. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=488.36s)]
*  And pounds moving up and down, that happens on lots of different days for different [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=492.08s)]
*  reasons. And so I wouldn't want to be blown off of the growth course because of an [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=495.32s)]
*  individual forecast on an individual day. We should be tracking it over a period. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=500.52s)]
*  And I think going forward, we will certainly be looking a lot more at the business [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=504.4s)]
*  investment rate. I think that's the one we need to be focused on. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay, Jordan Cummins, Chief Policy and Campaigns Officer at the CBI. Thanks for joining us. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIOyLCy1BM4&t=510.59999999999997s)]
