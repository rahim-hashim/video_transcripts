Video Description: Thousands of people have attended events in Waitangi, in northern New Zealand, to celebrate the country's national day amid a debate over the future of its founding document.
 
Waitangi Day marks the first signing of New Zealand's Treaty of Waitangi or Te Tiriti o Waitangi in M훮ori between the British Crown and M훮ori chiefs in 1840.
 
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon - who attended an event in the South Island - described the day as an opportunity to reflect on New Zealand's past as it charts its future.
 
But this year's events come at a time of increased tensions, as the government pursues policies considered by some to be anti-M훮ori.

# Waitangi Day: Thousands gather in New Zealand with M훮ori rights in focus | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY)
*  Thousands of people have gathered across New Zealand to celebrate the signing of the country's founding documents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=0.0s)]
*  A dawn ceremony in Waitangi marked the signing of the treaty between Britain and Maori chiefs in 1840. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=6.0s)]
*  The annual celebration has often seen protests and relations between the government and Maori have soured in the last 18 months. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=14.0s)]
*  Well, our correspondent Phil Mercer has been following events for us in Sydney. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=23.0s)]
*  There have been celebrations and protests marking Waitangi Day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=28.0s)]
*  This is to mark the occasion back in 1840 when many, but not all, Maori chiefs signed an agreement with the British Crown. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=33.0s)]
*  The Treaty of Waitangi is the founding document of modern New Zealand. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=43.0s)]
*  There are concerns among certainly indigenous campaigners that a bill that is being considered at the moment, a bill is a proposed new piece of legislation, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=51.0s)]
*  would reinterpret the Treaty of Waitangi and disadvantage further indigenous New Zealanders. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=62.0s)]
*  Now supporters of these proposed changes say that they will enhance equality in New Zealand. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=69.0s)]
*  Concern over the Treaty of Waitangi is really a symptom of these tensions between indigenous people and campaigners [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=76.0s)]
*  and the centre-right government led in New Zealand by the Prime Minister Christopher Luxon. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=84.0s)]
*  I was going to ask you why relations have soured so much in the last 18 months. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=90.0s)]
*  Is that the key reason why these changes and these various legal challenges going on? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=95.0s)]
*  You may well remember the former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=102.0s)]
*  She led a Labour-led government, a left of centre government for many years. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=106.0s)]
*  That was defeated in 2023 by Christopher Luxon and his centre-right coalition. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=111.0s)]
*  Critics of the government elected two years ago say that many of its policies have been an assault on indigenous language culture and their right to self-determination. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=117.0s)]
*  I'm just testing to know that today the Treaty of Waitangi is celebrating its 185th birthday. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=129.0s)]
*  Mr Luxon gave his Waitangi Day address, enhancing his view that New Zealand is a country heading towards unity [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=136.0s)]
*  and he was sharing his vision for shared prosperity between indigenous and non-indigenous people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=146.0s)]
*  It's safe to say once again a day of celebration and protests highlighted by continued tensions between indigenous Maori [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=153.0s)]
*  who make up about 20% of the population and the centre-right government of Mr Luxon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5Sfcr1JlY&t=162.0s)]
