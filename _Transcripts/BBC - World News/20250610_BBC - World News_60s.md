**BBC - World News:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4)
*  Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively has been dismissed by a judge in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4&t=0.0s)]
*  The pair, who both starred in the film It Ends With Us, have been locked in a legal battle for several months with the trial set for next year. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  But on Monday, Judge Lewis Lehmann dismissed Baldoni's countersuit, which alleged extortion, defamation and other allegations. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4&t=13.36s)]
*  His lawsuit centred on two claims, that Lively stole the film from him and his company Wayfarer by threatening not to promote it, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4&t=20.48s)]
*  and that she and others promoted a false narrative that Baldoni sexually assaulted her and launched a smear campaign against her, Judge Lehmann explained in his opinion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4&t=27.68s)]
*  The judge concluded that Baldoni and his production company have not adequately alleged that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4&t=36.16s)]
*  In a statement, Lively's lawyers called the dismissal a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Baldoni brought the suit after Lively filed a legal complaint last year against her former co-star, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4&t=48.64s)]
*  The BBC has contacted Baldoni's lawyers for comment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPseanTjZG4&t=57.36s)]
