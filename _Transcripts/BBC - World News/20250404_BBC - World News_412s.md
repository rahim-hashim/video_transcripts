Video Description: Global markets have dropped for a second day, as US President Donald Trump’s raft of global tariffs continue to spark fears of a global downturn.
 
London's FTSE 100 index fell on opening, along with the Cac 40 in Paris and Frankfurt's Dax, following further decline in the Asian markets overnight. 
 
Trump has said his tariffs rollout is going "very well" and the economy is going to “boom”, after US markets closed on Thursday with the biggest one-day loss since the pandemic hit in 2020.

# European stock markets slide at open in the wake of Trump's tariffs | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA)
*  President Trump has insisted that his implementation of new global tariffs is going very well and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=0.0s)]
*  would help the US economy to flourish. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=6.04s)]
*  The move has caused turmoil on global markets and sparked concerns it could lead to a recession. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=8.28s)]
*  In the past hour, European stock markets have opened. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=13.92s)]
*  This is Frankfurt, a stock exchange where the stocks are still falling. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=17.16s)]
*  The DAX fell 3% on Thursday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Early trading has seen the FTSE 100 in London down by more than 1% while the Paris stock [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=23.84s)]
*  market is similarly down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=29.26s)]
*  Stock markets around the world plunged to the lowest level since March 2020 and led [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=31.94s)]
*  to the World Trade Organisation forecasting that the global economy will shrink by 1% [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=36.42s)]
*  this year. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  The UK was hit by a 10% tax on US imports. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile, other countries like China, Canada and the European Union will have to pay a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=45.86s)]
*  far higher price. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  British Foreign Minister David Lammy is in Brussels for a NATO summit. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=52.18000000000001s)]
*  When asked about the impact of President Trump's tariffs, he said that all options were on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=55.54s)]
*  the table. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=59.7s)]
*  We are engaged in discussions with the United States to strike an economic agreement and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=85.5s)]
*  an economic deal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=93.78s)]
*  And of course, we have been absolutely clear that all options are on the table. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=97.26s)]
*  With me is Ty Genwright, our business presenter. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=106.02s)]
*  So tell us about this morning and how things are reacting after those big falls yesterday. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=107.86s)]
*  The sentiment continues to move downwards. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=112.14s)]
*  Trading in Europe has been underway for just over an hour now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=116.1s)]
*  We had live pictures coming in to us from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=119.38s)]
*  As soon as that bell rang, the numbers continued to fall. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=122.78s)]
*  That following the trend set in Asia, which was the first opportunity to react to Donald [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=125.98s)]
*  Trump's tariff announcement on Wednesday. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=131.06s)]
*  They've had two days of trading now, both of which have gone downwards. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=133.94s)]
*  In Wall Street yesterday, we saw the biggest fall since March of 2020, that being the beginnings [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=137.7s)]
*  of the Covid pandemic and all the consequences of lockdowns. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  So you really get a sense of just how seismic a shift investors, though people who are putting [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=146.9s)]
*  their money on the line every single day, betting on the future prospects of various [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=151.7s)]
*  companies, how they're feeling about all this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=156.42s)]
*  Interestingly, here in Europe today, as stocks continue to decline, declines of about 1% [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=159.78s)]
*  across the board on the FTSE, the DAX, the Caq Caron. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=165.42s)]
*  It's banking stocks that are particularly suffering. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=168.74s)]
*  An index looking at the wider banking sector is down by 4%, most likely because of these [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=171.78s)]
*  growing warnings about the recession, which could follow these tariffs if they remain [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=176.82s)]
*  in place. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=181.82s)]
*  We've heard from JP Morgan, the investment bank, saying putting at 60% the chances of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=182.82s)]
*  a global recession. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=188.1s)]
*  And the very noted economist, Mohammed Al-Aryan, he's now the chief economic adviser to Allianz [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  the big German financial services firm, saying that the chances of a recession in the United [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=195.3s)]
*  States are now, as he put it, uncomfortably high. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=199.70000000000002s)]
*  So that's the market's verdict on Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=203.78s)]
*  And meanwhile, we're looking at some of the reactions from the countries deciding what [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=206.58s)]
*  to do in response to this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=209.58s)]
*  Yeah, and we don't know exactly what they are going to do just yet. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  Certainly, we've heard tough words coming out of Brussels and out of Beijing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=214.74s)]
*  They're talking about robust responses. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  Exactly what they're going to do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=221.74s)]
*  We're still waiting for that reaction. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=222.74s)]
*  They've talked about being, shall we say, more targeted, more smart in their response, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=224.3s)]
*  aiming, I suppose, not to penalise their own consumers with the kind of inflation that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=230.5s)]
*  many people are fearing will happen in the United States. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  But we still don't have any precise detail on that yet. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=237.46s)]
*  And when we do get it, well, perhaps that might provide another reason for the markets [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=240.66000000000003s)]
*  for investors to be fearful. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=246.18s)]
*  Tagin Wright, thank you very much indeed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to speak now to Ross Mould, who's an investment director at AJ Bell. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=250.98s)]
*  Thanks very much indeed for being with us. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=254.66s)]
*  So tell us what your impression is and whether we're seeing this is going to continue for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=256.06s)]
*  several days or how your appreciation is of the sentiment now in the market. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think the challenge that we've got from the narrow and selfish perspective of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=264.94s)]
*  financial markets is that all through last year, they were expecting a cooling in inflation, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=268.98s)]
*  steady economic growth and falling interest rates from central banks. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=274.58s)]
*  And the Trump tariff trade situation questions all three of those very biggest assumptions. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=278.9s)]
*  Prices may now go up. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=285.02s)]
*  Does that mean that central banks can record interest rates? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  And as we've been hearing, we have worries about economic growth as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=288.29999999999995s)]
*  So they're very rosy scenario now looks an awful lot less clear. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=291.06s)]
*  And that's why we're seeing these very sharp share price falls. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  Now tell us about the real world effect of share price falls, because sometimes people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=297.85999999999996s)]
*  might look at it and think, well, actually, you know, I'm not interested in share prices. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=301.29999999999995s)]
*  Tell us why it's important and what the actual effect is on economies. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=304.5s)]
*  I mean, in terms of share prices, a lot of people will have their money in their pension [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=308.1s)]
*  in shares, in stock markets. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=311.74s)]
*  And so they may feel depending on how long the share price falls for, last fall, they [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=314.02s)]
*  may feel some impact there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=318.58s)]
*  And there is clearly a hope that this is a short term squall and that Trump, President [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=320.22s)]
*  Trump either extracts the deals that he's looking for or that the global ultimately [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=325.02s)]
*  finds a solution and a workaround and that economic growth continues. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=328.86s)]
*  So this is likely, you would like to think to be one of those bumps that we get every [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=332.22s)]
*  five, 10 or 15 years, rather than something that leads to a major problem like it did [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=336.26s)]
*  in the 1930s. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=341.06s)]
*  But that is one effect that it could have upon people's pensions if share price, if [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=342.42s)]
*  asset valuations stay depressed for a long time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=346.3s)]
*  But, you know, barring your exception, that's quite unusual. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=348.3s)]
*  And do you expect President Trump to persist with this or do you see him potentially backing [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=351.06s)]
*  down? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=355.38s)]
*  I think that's the next question that everybody's asking themselves, whether it's politicians, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=356.22s)]
*  policymakers, economists or investors. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=360.02s)]
*  Some people are assuming that, I think there's been an assumption so far that this is an [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  art of the deal, that America will look to extract better trade terms from key trading [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=367.14000000000004s)]
*  partners and that this may be a short-term issue that goes away. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=371.5s)]
*  But there are other strands within the Republican Party who see this as a major revenue generator [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=375.1s)]
*  and a means of cutting income tax. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=379.54s)]
*  And the President himself is saying he views this as a long-term situation that's worth [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  short-term pay to onshore production to boost American jobs. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=386.46000000000004s)]
*  So that isn't a short-term trading transaction, that is a long-term economic policy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=391.06s)]
*  So it really depends where we go from here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=396.9s)]
*  If we do get some trades and deals, I think markets will relax. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=399.02s)]
*  If America sticks to this course and seems determined to do so, they'll stay quite nervous. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=403.5s)]
*  Ross Mould, thank you very much indeed for joining us there with your insight. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=408.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=092zLFY9nAA&t=410.7s)]
