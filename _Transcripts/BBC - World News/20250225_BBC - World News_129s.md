Video Description: Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed.
 
Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including "humiliating" handover ceremonies.
 
A senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to "grave danger" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel.
 
The deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun.
