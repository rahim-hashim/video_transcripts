Video Description: President Donald Trump has agreed to hold off imposing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days, but not on China.
 
After last-minute calls with Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to reinforce his country's border with the US to clamp down on migration and the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl.
 
Both Trump and Trudeau have portrayed the plan as a win.
 
"As president, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans, and I am doing just that. I am very pleased with this initial outcome," Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social.
 
Trudeau said Canada was implementing a $1.3bn (Â£1bn) border plan that included nearly 10,000 frontline workers and more resources to halt the flow of fentanyl, a synthetic drug 50 times stronger than heroin, which Trump has cited as a major concern.
 
The prime minister also said Canada would appoint a "fentanyl czar" and launch a joint strike force with the US to combat crime, fentanyl and money laundering.
 
Much of the border security plan had already been announced by Canada in December.

*  Fagan. Drew, good to have you with us. Earlier in the programme I was speaking to someone [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  in China who was saying they were sort of expecting these tariffs, feeling reasonably [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=65.76s)]
*  philosophical about it. I have family in Canada. I wonder if you could explain to us just how [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=70.66s)]
*  outraged Canadians are about what is going on. So we have had free trade with the United [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=76.28s)]
*  States for 35 years. We began negotiating 40 years ago. And the ties between the two [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=83.2s)]
*  countries, historic ties beyond economic, but also the economic ties are deep. But we [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=90.0s)]
*  have a challenge in the sense that although the United States to some extent depends on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=98.36s)]
*  Canada for its prosperity, we just depend far more on them for our prosperity. Our trade [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=103.36s)]
*  ties are very deep. And as a result, what's happened over the last few weeks has, I wouldn't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=109.88s)]
*  say shattered necessarily, but really shaken our confidence in the United States as an [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  ally and friend and economic partner. Is it deeper than that, though, Drew? We've seen [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  booing at hockey games, at basketball games as well. And it doesn't feel like it's just [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=127.08s)]
*  about the tariffs. It's the rhetoric coming from Donald Trump, the talk about Canada becoming [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  a 51st state. We're a sovereign country. And for him to be trolling us in this way has [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=135.76s)]
*  outraged Canadians. Absolutely. And there are real questions about our relationship far [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=144.0s)]
*  more broadly than just trade relations. You know, there are issues between our two countries. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=149.84s)]
*  There always are issues, fence spending, security at the border. But there's something to be [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=155.64s)]
*  negotiated. There are issues with regard to, for example, guns coming north or frankly, fentanyl [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=160.84s)]
*  coming north. But this wasn't a negotiation. This was a bit of a shakedown. And as a result, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=167.0s)]
*  the anger is very evident. As you mentioned, you know, the United States national anthem has [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=172.56s)]
*  been booed at hockey games and basketball games. This is wild stuff and totally unnecessary in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=178.0s)]
*  the context of, you know, the deep ties we have. Drew, what about the White House, the new White [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=185.36s)]
*  House yesterday saying this there's been misrepresent, that been misrepresented. This is not a trade [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=190.2s)]
*  war with Canada. It's a drug war. They're kind of trying to reframe it a bit. How has that gone [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=195.72s)]
*  down in the US? I mean, you've just mentioned fentanyl, very little fentanyl comes in from [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=201.72s)]
*  Canada to the United States. It's viewed as a pretext. And part of the challenge is that we [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  don't really know what the president wants. Of course, there are all sorts of actions he's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=212.12s)]
*  taking domestically that are shaking up Washington. So I guess in some sense, why wouldn't you try to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=217.4s)]
*  shake up his closest partner and friend? But it still feels just beyond the pale with regard to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=223.72s)]
*  bilateral relations. You know, we do have a renegotiation of the USMCA, the free trade [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=230.68s)]
*  agreement, including Mexico as well, due next year. And it feels like this is a first step towards [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  but it's not really the way you negotiate in a responsible way. We do have issues. We want to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=244.28s)]
*  deepen those ties. There are things we can do together better with regard to energy, with regard [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=250.44s)]
*  to critical minerals, with regard to technology. There's lots of thinking going on in Canada with [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=255.8s)]
*  regard to that. But all that has been put on hold due to, you know, as I say, capriciousness. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=261.48s)]
*  And just briefly, in terms of border security and what's been agreed, is there anything actually [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=267.96s)]
*  new here that Canada is now promising the US? Because I thought these were proposals that were [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=272.84s)]
*  put in place weeks ago. That's essentially the case. Before President Trump took power [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago, Prime Minister Trudeau did go down to Mar-a-Lago and he made offers with [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=285.08s)]
*  over a billion dollars in additional spending at the border. But of course, we've been working [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=290.67999999999995s)]
*  closely with the United States on border security going back to 9-11 or even before 9-11. There [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  really isn't anything new here in what was announced yesterday. And, you know, the kind [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=301.96s)]
*  of things that we can negotiate generally on an ongoing basis. Professor Drew Fragan, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=308.2s)]
*  great to get your thoughts. Thanks for joining us. Thank you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPUy-2xsIw&t=314.44s)]
