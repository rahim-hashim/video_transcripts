Video Description: Apple plans to invest more than $500bn (Â£396bn) in the US over the next four years, starting with a new advanced manufacturing factory in Texas.
 
The tech giant said it expected to create 20,000 new jobs over that time, with the "vast majority" of roles in research and development, software and artificial intelligence.
 
It is not clear to what extent the spending is an acceleration of the company's current activities. Apple said the sum included everything from spending on suppliers to Apple TV+ productions.
 
The announcement comes days after Apple boss Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump, who has made increased corporate investment in the US a priority.

# Apple commits to $500bn US investment | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0)
*  Welcome to Business Today, live from New York. I'm Michelle Floury. We begin here in the United States where markets have just opened. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=0.0s)]
*  Higher, the S&P recovering after its worst day of the year on Friday. One of the big movers this morning is Apple. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=8.0s)]
*  It says it will spend more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years and hire 20,000 staff. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=14.0s)]
*  This comes after President Donald Trump pushed companies to shift their manufacturing back home. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=23.0s)]
*  Plans include a new factory in Texas doubling Apple's U.S. advanced manufacturing fund. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=29.0s)]
*  Now this new factory is expected to make AI servers. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=35.0s)]
*  But Apple is just one company announcing new investments in the United States. This onshore trend, which is gathering pace. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=39.0s)]
*  Skyler Waynen, Chief Investment Officer at Regan Capital joins me now. Skyler, great to see you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=47.0s)]
*  Do you think Apple would be doing this without Donald Trump? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=53.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. I think they're kind of on their heels competing with with Meta, with Google. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=57.0s)]
*  It's an arms race to get in front of this AI revolution, which is going to be just as important as the start of the Internet in the 90s. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=64.0s)]
*  So but you're seeing this big bifurcation also announced this morning. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=74.0s)]
*  Starbucks is cutting seven percent of their employees. And now you have Apple hiring folks. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=78.0s)]
*  And so it's this tale of two cities, really, in the U.S. here, particularly on what's moving forward and what some companies that are pulling back a little bit in order to save margin and save profitability. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=83.0s)]
*  So, I mean, in the case of Starbucks, I'm glad you brought that up. I mean, they've announced they're shedding what is it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=97.0s)]
*  Eleven hundred corporate workers, part of the new CEO's attempts to kind of right size the company. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=102.0s)]
*  Is that what we're seeing sort of in more traditional areas, service sectors, which perhaps are not the bright spots in the way that technology has been? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah, pretty similar to what's going on in the government where, hey, let's let's cut seven percent, let's cut 10 percent. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=117.0s)]
*  I've seen a lot of those headlines recently and let's figure it out. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=125.0s)]
*  Let's figure out how to do this operation more efficiently. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=129.0s)]
*  And so there was an article in the Journal this weekend about spending of high income workers versus low income workers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=134.0s)]
*  And so it's this we're moving in a direction post quantitative easing, post covid, post stimulus, where there's going to be some winners and losers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=142.0s)]
*  And if you can pick the winners and they call it stock pickers market here, but there's going to be a lot of shift shifts in the A.I. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=153.0s)]
*  away from traditional corporate environment. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=165.0s)]
*  And let's try and figure out how to do more with less. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=168.0s)]
*  Let's let's maintain profitability. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=171.0s)]
*  Let's maintain margins with less overhead. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=173.0s)]
*  And so the companies that are able to do that are going to do really, really well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=177.0s)]
*  But if you're a Google, a made one of these companies with a ton of cash, you have to spend money right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=182.0s)]
*  And I guess we're going to be hearing from one of those potential winners later this week, Nvidia, the A.I. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=188.0s)]
*  Darling reports later in the week. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=194.0s)]
*  Skyler Wainan, Chief Investment Officer at Regan Capital. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=196.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of6eZNd9xx0&t=199.0s)]
