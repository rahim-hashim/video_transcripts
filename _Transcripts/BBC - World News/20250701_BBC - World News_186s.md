Video Description: The US Senate is holding a marathon vote on a budget bill that is critical to President Donald Trump's agenda.
 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act hangs in the balance as Republicans - who control both chambers of Congress - remain split over how much to cut welfare programmes as they seek to extend tax breaks.
 
If approved in the Senate, the bill will return to the lower House of Representatives, which passed its own version by a single vote last month.
 
Elon Musk has stepped up his criticism of Republicans who "campaigned on reducing government spending" and then "immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history".

# US Senate holds marathon vote on Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE)
*  Elon Musk has once again criticized Donald Trump over his tax and spending plans, which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=0.0s)]
*  the US president has dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill. In a post on X, the former presidential [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=6.3s)]
*  adviser said, if this insane spending bill passes, the America party will be formed the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=12.06s)]
*  next day. Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=18.28s)]
*  the people actually have a voice. The US Senate has begun its marathon vote on a series of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=24.46s)]
*  amendments to the bill. They're working against a self-imposed deadline, trying to have it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=30.42s)]
*  on President Trump's desk by the 4th of July. It's been deeply divisive on both sides of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=35.86s)]
*  the floor. The Democrats denounced the bill's proposed cuts to health insurance programs, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=41.14s)]
*  while Republicans are split over the impact on the US deficit. Well, now let's now speak [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=46.82s)]
*  to our CBS correspondent, Naomi Rackham, who joins us from New York. And Naomi, just talk us [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=52.82s)]
*  through this voting process. How long is it expected to last? Well, Katherine, it's good to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=59.3s)]
*  be with you. And here we are, another overnight session in Washington. This marathon vote series [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=65.34s)]
*  is continuing now into the wee hours at about 4.20 local time there in Washington. The current [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=71.02s)]
*  stage is called a votorama, which is a long stream of proposed amendments being voted on [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=77.86s)]
*  one by one. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer says Democrats will bring amendment after [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=83.62s)]
*  amendment after amendment to the floor so Republicans can defend their billionaire tax cuts, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=89.74s)]
*  which is another way of saying that they will delay the inevitable final vote as long as [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=95.62s)]
*  possible. While senators are mingling on the floor, most negotiations are actually happening [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=100.42s)]
*  behind closed doors. Katherine? Apologies for interrupting you there, Naomi. What are the main [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=105.5s)]
*  sticking points, would you say? Well, there's so much to discuss in this massive bill. And while [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=110.34s)]
*  a vast majority of the pushback is coming from Democrats across the aisle, there is also some [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=116.54s)]
*  internal resistance from within the Republican Party as well. The bill includes an extension [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=121.68s)]
*  of the president's 2017 tax cuts, along with his campaign promise of no tax on tips, a new tax on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  wind and solar projects that use materials from China, and increased border and defense spending. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=135.06s)]
*  But lawmakers in both parties have come out against the steep cuts to Medicaid, which is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=141.14000000000001s)]
*  America's insurance program for those who have lower income. The Congressional Budget Office [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=147.38s)]
*  also estimated Sunday that the legislation would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=153.18s)]
*  the next decade. And with a 53 seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose support [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=160.78s)]
*  from three Republicans that would still then require a tiebreaker from the vice president. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=166.9s)]
*  And two Republican senators are most certainly going to vote no on the package, really leaving [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=171.94s)]
*  only one or two votes as wiggle room. Katherine? Naomi, thank you. That's Naomi Rackham from our [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=176.94s)]
*  U.S. partner, CBS. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VFiIEMsYE&t=183.42000000000002s)]
