# New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern: 'I'm a mother, not a superwoman' - BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [January 22, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA)
*  I was rather hoping that you would have your seven-month-old baby girl with you on this trip [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=0.0s)]
*  because we regularly do political interviews and we regularly have babies and children on set [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  but never at the same time. So it would have been a first for us but I understand why. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=8.32s)]
*  Although she has traveled with you on various trips, hasn't she? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  She has, well actually just the one, domestically she travels with me all the time but internationally [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=15.52s)]
*  it was just the UN General Assembly where she came with me because she was quite young. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=21.36s)]
*  Other trips, for one reason or another, sometimes she physically hasn't been able to go into the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=26.88s)]
*  countries that I've visited so there she is. And in this shot I actually had no awareness [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  that there was media in the room. It was a Nelson Mandela Peace Summit and it was reasonably quiet [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  but I couldn't see them. The media were all up in the gallery above us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  But was she with you then because you were still breastfeeding? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=46.72s)]
*  I was still breastfeeding, yes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  And that's your partner next to you, Clark Aset. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Yes, always in close proximity. So he had a lot of fun trying to find places to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=52.8s)]
*  change her and trying to find breastfeeding spaces at the UN. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=56.64s)]
*  Do you feel unsettled when you're away from her or not? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=60.32s)]
*  I do find it difficult. I go through the exact same emotion any other parent does [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=62.56s)]
*  when I'm away from her for a period of time. But I video call and not that obviously you have much [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=66.4s)]
*  of a conversation with a seven-month-old but I try and keep contact. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=73.52s)]
*  Yes. Tell our audience the purpose of your meeting with the British Prime Minister later today. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=76.88s)]
*  This is an opportunity obviously when you travel 24 hours to Europe given I'm travelling for the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  World Economic Forum and also here to promote New Zealand's currently negotiating a free trade [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  agreement with the EU. This is also an opportunity for me to stop here in London in obviously a very [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=94.08s)]
*  unsettled period of time just to say our relationship is deep, it's long, it's not just economic. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  But obviously as an important trading partner for us, at the point that the UK is ready to do so, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  we're very keen to enter into a free trade agreement. So we're ready and willing and I [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=115.36s)]
*  think are an excellent potential future partner for that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=119.6s)]
*  And why is that important? Because actually exports from New Zealand to this country, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean it's about 3%, 4%, it's pretty small. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=127.52s)]
*  Well for us you're still a significant trading partner for us. For the biggest it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=130.64s)]
*  represents roughly $5 billion worth of trade. That is significant for a trading [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=135.68s)]
*  for a small trading nation like ours. And so no, we would consider it to be a real priority for us. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=140.32s)]
*  And look for the UK in terms of the advantage of an agreement with us. We're a reliable partner. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=146.4s)]
*  We've negotiated a number of free trade agreements. We negotiate high quality agreements. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=152.8s)]
*  We're very focused on good labour standards, environmental standards. So I think we would be [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=157.28s)]
*  able to create a rule, a gold standard for what future free trade agreements with the UK could [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=163.28s)]
*  look like. But presumably it's more of a priority for your country to get a free trade deal with the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=168.0s)]
*  EU, with their massive market of $500 million. That is still obviously significant for us. But [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=172.8s)]
*  we don't as well. For us it's not just the size, it's the quality of these agreements. And our [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  people to people ties are so important. I used to live here. I lived here for several years. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=183.84s)]
*  I've got a niece and nephew who were born here. There are 60,000 New Zealanders here at any given [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=189.68s)]
*  time. So I don't underestimate it. It's not just about our economic ties and our goods and services. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=194.72s)]
*  It's the fact that this is a relationship that's deep and important to us. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  You described it as an unsettled time here. That is potentially an understatement. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=205.12s)]
*  Theresa May is having a very difficult time trying to come up with a deal to leave the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=210.32s)]
*  EU that is popular with MPs in this country. As one Prime Minister observing another, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=214.56s)]
*  what do you think of the way she's handling things? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=220.48s)]
*  The last thing I ever do is dish out advice or commentary on other people's politics. It's a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=223.36s)]
*  difficult game. I know from certainly where I am, you often don't know or don't see some of the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=229.28s)]
*  extra layers behind the scenes. She is a woman of remarkable resilience. I have admiration for a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=237.92s)]
*  number of politicians for what they have to navigate. And this is one of those situations. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=244.88s)]
*  What I can speak to though is back in New Zealand, we have a different political system. We run under [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  MMP like Germany. I run a government that has a full majority out of three parties. So what I'm [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  at least very used to is that we have constantly negotiating. We're constantly forming compromise [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=260.64s)]
*  and dialogue with other parties. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=266.8s)]
*  Well what skills do you employ because there has been some criticism of the British Prime Minister [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  that she hasn't been able to bring people with her. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=272.16s)]
*  Mind you, we all operate in the systems that we've inherited. I'm in a system where all of the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=274.88s)]
*  political parties I work alongside, we're used to it. We have since 1996 been in an environment [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=280.32s)]
*  where that's how we form government. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=286.24s)]
*  But it's about people skills, isn't it? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=287.52s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=289.2s)]
*  To find a consensus amongst a load of politicians who don't agree. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=289.92s)]
*  Yes, it absolutely is. But it's also about the system you're operating in. So we are all used [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=293.76s)]
*  to having to negotiate, having to compromise, having to test where each other's red lines are. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  That's something that I only know how to do politics in that way. So it's a bit about your [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=305.68s)]
*  environment too. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=310.64s)]
*  You use referendums in New Zealand sometimes. You've got one in 2020 to decide whether cannabis [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=311.68s)]
*  can be used for recreational purposes. Do you think they're a good way to resolve political issues? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=317.68s)]
*  Look, I think genuinely there's a real dialogue and debate around where some of these issues, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=323.44s)]
*  they can be useful tools. At the same time, we've had them in the past where they haven't [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=330.88s)]
*  been able to resolve issues as well. So I think it's all about in the way that they're utilized. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=338.08s)]
*  We really genuinely, I think as politicians, and a bit of a question mark for us over how we deal [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=344.0s)]
*  with the future status of cannabis. It's one we're very genuinely putting to the people. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=350.16s)]
*  There isn't this deeply entrenched view from politicians. So I think under those circumstances, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  it's a very useful tool. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=361.92s)]
*  Do you worry about the prospect of this country leaving the EU without a deal? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=365.04s)]
*  Would that impact on New Zealand? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=372.16s)]
*  Absolutely. It would impact on just about everybody. Business in particular, it would be [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=374.24s)]
*  very particularly smaller businesses. And whilst absolutely the decision over whether to leave or [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=380.56s)]
*  remain is a matter for the people, I will be very open that a no deal scenario would be very, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  very difficult. But I sense that everyone is of that view. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  Although the leader of the Labour Party in this country, Jeremy Corbyn, is basically asking the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=399.28s)]
*  British Prime Minister Theresa May to take no deal off the table. So that is not a scenario. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=404.88s)]
*  Do you agree with it? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=408.96s)]
*  How the mechanisms, the manner in which things are negotiated, these are all matters for the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=411.2s)]
*  politicians here. But I can hand on heart, say from our perspective and New Zealand businesses [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=418.32s)]
*  perspective, no deal would be very difficult. Are you due to meet Jeremy Corbyn? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  Not Jeremy Corbyn. I'm only here till this evening. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  Could you not please him? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=430.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, I've had a very short period of time. And I imagine that, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  like Prime Minister May, everyone is very, very occupied. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=436.08s)]
*  Would you say you are a Corbynista or a Blairite? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=440.55999999999995s)]
*  I don't liken myself to any other politician. I know this is a natural inclination we have to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  put people into categories to better understand their politics. I've never likened myself to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=450.23999999999995s)]
*  anyone. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=456.16s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. I wanted to ask you about the death of Grace Millane, the British backpacker [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=456.56s)]
*  who died in your country towards the end of last year. Last week a man appeared in court and denied [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=463.44s)]
*  her murder. And in a news conference last month you apologised on behalf of your country to Grace's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=467.92s)]
*  family. Let's just take a look. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=474.32s)]
*  There is this overwhelming sense of hurt and shame that this has happened in our country [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=478.24s)]
*  a place that prides itself on our hospitality, on our manaakitanga, especially to those who [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  are visiting our shores. And so on behalf of New Zealand, I want to apologise to Grace's family. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=492.56s)]
*  Your daughter should have been safe here and she wasn't and I'm sorry for that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=502.32s)]
*  Why did you feel that you wanted to apologise? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=508.64s)]
*  New Zealand is a place that really prides itself on its hospitality. I used a word there, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=512.4s)]
*  manaakitanga. And that really speaks to that idea that if you come to New Zealand, we care for you, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=517.36s)]
*  we look after you, we have a real sense of hospitality. And that's something that New [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=523.28s)]
*  Zealanders deeply hold. And so to have a young person who came to enjoy New Zealand and to have [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=528.72s)]
*  their life cut tragically short, that was something that New Zealanders I sense felt very, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=536.4s)]
*  very deeply. All of us. And I was one of them. And that's not to diminish. We have, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=541.92s)]
*  listening to an early guest, we have a terrible domestic violence issue in New Zealand. We [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=549.76s)]
*  experience the loss of our woman at a staggering rate. That is not to diminish that. But this was [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=555.6s)]
*  a particular case where this was a guest and we hadn't been able to care for her as New Zealanders [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=562.08s)]
*  like to. I wonder if you were also potentially, and you may not have been, but reflecting on the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=569.28s)]
*  fact that you now had a daughter. Undoubtedly. I know that this is something that I was prepared [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=574.16s)]
*  for because you have parents of course explain this new phenomenon of you feeling emotions that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=582.32s)]
*  much more acutely when you become a parent. And undoubtedly that's happened for me. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=587.68s)]
*  Yeah. What have you done? What can you do to protect other young people heading towards your [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=593.12s)]
*  country? Oh, and of course, we would still maintain that New Zealand is a safe place, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  but where we have had an absolutely awful act and a tragedy occur. But we do all we can to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=606.8s)]
*  maintain that level of safety that people can come to New Zealand and expect that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=615.28s)]
*  You have been called the anti-Trump by Vogue magazine, but the US newspaper, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=620.16s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal said you were similar to Donald Trump when it comes to immigration, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=625.52s)]
*  which is more accurate. Well, of course, again, I try not to simply have myself described versus [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=629.28s)]
*  what I am relative to other politicians. It's very fair to say that the contrary by The Wall [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  Street Journal I pushed back on quite heavily. We are as well a government that's increased our [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=641.28s)]
*  quota of refugees that we accept into New Zealand. So I absolutely rejected that comparison. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=646.72s)]
*  When you met Donald Trump, what did you think of him? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=651.6s)]
*  That he in person presents as he does on the public stage. And obviously has an agenda that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=655.92s)]
*  he feels very keenly and is very focused on. Obviously, we take different views on many issues. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=664.72s)]
*  You have experienced some verbal abuse, all politicians do. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=672.72s)]
*  We do. I'm going to mention one insult, if it's all right with you. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=676.64s)]
*  By all means, it's obviously one I've heard before. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=681.36s)]
*  One party leader in New Zealand said lipstick on a pig. Another said politics needed more than [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=684.32s)]
*  smiles and waves. That was aimed at you. You've been in politics for 20 years. You [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=690.48s)]
*  joined the Labour Party as a teenager. How sexist have you found the world of politics to be? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=694.72s)]
*  I think probably what I would describe those as are just the insults that exist within politics. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=699.76s)]
*  In terms of the gendered nature, actually New Zealand relative to others, we do fairly well. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=707.04s)]
*  I'm the third female Prime Minister. Those previous Prime Ministers have carved a path for [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=712.48s)]
*  me that I'm incredibly grateful for. There wasn't a huge amount of commentary in New Zealand about [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=717.92s)]
*  my sex because that wasn't of interest. That's something now for us that's not unusual. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=722.8s)]
*  Is there a bit of gender and sexism? Yes, there is in most environments. But actually, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=730.8s)]
*  I think relative to others, we do pretty well. What instead I would point to there is that that's [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=736.88s)]
*  a bit of old politics as usual. But is it acceptable? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=742.32s)]
*  Generally, the tone of politics I think needs to change. Whether it's sexism, whether it's ageism, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=746.4000000000001s)]
*  personality politics generally I would say is the issue globally. We want our people to be engaged [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=753.12s)]
*  in politics. When they're not, it's a problem. It means that we have democracies that people don't [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=761.6s)]
*  buy into anymore. The more that we have that tit for tat, name calling, insults, it looks as if [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=766.16s)]
*  we're not focused on the things that matter to people. People disengage and our democracies come [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=772.8s)]
*  under threat. That's a much bigger issue for me than a focus on sexism. Fair enough. But I did want [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=777.8399999999999s)]
*  to ask you about the Me Too movement, which of course swept the world last year. It started in [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=783.6s)]
*  Hollywood, went through so many other professions, including politics. Have you ever experienced [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=786.88s)]
*  sexual harassment in politics? For me, it's more as a status as an employee in the past. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=792.4s)]
*  I've experienced it, but actually in multiple workplaces, politics is not the only place I think [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=801.76s)]
*  it's existed. What kind of thing have you experienced? I've never got into too much detail [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=805.84s)]
*  because mostly because I don't think this is about me as an individual. I do think it's about the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=810.4s)]
*  movement. I've also been very quick, as I've just done now, to point out that for me I've had [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=816.24s)]
*  as many experiences in professions outside of politics. To say that this is not about one place [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=822.24s)]
*  of work, it's not about Hollywood. But you're saying it's happened to you as well. You would say [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=828.4s)]
*  hashtag Me Too. Show me a woman it hasn't happened to. And then let's start a conversation about how [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=835.52s)]
*  that has been possible for them because we need to create an environment where all women are free [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=840.8s)]
*  from those experiences. Right, Laura has texted. She wants to ask this. I'm a mum of a 13 month [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=846.24s)]
*  old with a demanding job. How do you manage tiredness, relationships at work and making [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  decisions on limited sleep? Was that Victoria? No, Laura. Laura. Probably I just grapple with it the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=858.16s)]
*  exact same way that Laura's probably trying to do. We take every day as it comes. My partner Clark [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  and I, we juggle the care of Niamh between ourselves and our wonderful mothers. We don't [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=871.68s)]
*  have a nanny. Some of the logistics of living between two cities is a bit testing. And you know, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=878.4s)]
*  those days where I've got Niamh in the front pack and nappy bags and trying to get on planes and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=883.8399999999999s)]
*  read papers. It is sometimes a struggle, but it's giving me an experience that is similar to all the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=888.7199999999999s)]
*  women who work and juggle family. I find that incredibly insightful, important to me as I do [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=897.76s)]
*  my job. So I value those experiences. I don't have any tricks, but I do have a baby that sleeps. So [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=904.64s)]
*  I'm very lucky. You are. Which is harder, being Prime Minister or being a new mum? They are [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=910.88s)]
*  completely different roles. I get a different joy from motherhood than I do in my role as Prime [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=916.24s)]
*  Minister. And she is a perfect anecdote. So actually what I'm finding is that we're working [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=924.56s)]
*  beautifully together. Really? Yeah. Okay. At the end of a day where, of course, it's easy to feel [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=929.52s)]
*  like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders, at least the weight of your country, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  it's amazing what her just giggling at me can do to just bring perspective. Which is more pleasurable? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=940.64s)]
*  I get great joy from both, but I have said that because being Prime Minister, it is a privilege. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=948.7199999999999s)]
*  As much as it is a difficult job, it is a privilege. But politics comes and goes. And when [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=956.8s)]
*  I'm done in politics, I will always be a mum. Do you feel conflicted sometimes, pulled one way, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=962.0s)]
*  when actually you want to spend time with your baby? Oh, absolutely. So does every parent, I [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=968.16s)]
*  expect, mums and dads. And do you experience the guilt? Do you feel that guilt? Oh, yes, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=973.2s)]
*  yeah. Absolutely. And that's the guilt of whether or not I'm a good enough daughter, sister, partner, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=978.32s)]
*  mother. But again, show me a woman who doesn't. Bill on Twitter says this. I would like to ask [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=984.8000000000001s)]
*  the Prime Minister of New Zealand if she has a spare hour, could she take on being Prime Minister [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  of the UK as well? Being a mum, she'll be used to multitasking and doing five things at once, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=996.0s)]
*  so running the UK should be easy for her. Sadly, our current politicians couldn't even change a [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1000.32s)]
*  nappy. Thankfully, I don't have the challenges that the politicians here do at this time. We've [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1005.44s)]
*  got our own, but they're very, very different. Now, Michelle Obama was recently reported as [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1010.4000000000001s)]
*  saying that the idea that women can have it all is a lie. Is she right? I think, you know, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1015.36s)]
*  I was very aware that even when I announced that I was having need, that there was the sense that [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1023.84s)]
*  I needed to prove that it was somehow possible for women to do everything. And I've always been [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1028.56s)]
*  open about saying that actually I can't. I can't physically do the job of being Prime Minister and [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1035.6799999999998s)]
*  mother by myself. And so I constantly talk about the fact that we should not expect women to be [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1041.2s)]
*  superhuman. And so I do what I do because I have the support and help and co-parenting of my partner [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1047.44s)]
*  client. That's how I do what I do. I'm not a superwoman and we shouldn't pretend that we are. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1056.8s)]
*  That does a disservice to all women. It raises expectations that no one can meet. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1062.72s)]
*  I mean, when I look on your Twitter feed, there are some people on there who are, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1067.84s)]
*  you know, really praising you and saying you are a superwoman. That's how they view you. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1072.8s)]
*  Yeah, no. No, you know, and there are days when I walk into my house and think, you know, there's [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1077.52s)]
*  probably if there's any side I'm letting down, it's the tidiness of the house that I live in. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1084.88s)]
*  So I am no super superwoman at all. And I think we set ourselves up to fail if we ever present [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1089.5200000000002s)]
*  in that way. So look, from time to time, I might do a press conference with a bit of sick on my [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1096.4s)]
*  shoulder. But for me, that's just because I'm human. And I don't mind people seeing frailty. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1100.4s)]
*  I'm just trying to imagine if a politician here did a press conference with a bit of baby sick on [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1109.0400000000002s)]
*  it will be such a big deal. And that's, you know, that's probably our fault as well, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1114.0800000000002s)]
*  as in we in the media. You've previously talked about how anxious you get. And you thought [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1119.2s)]
*  anxiety could preclude you from the top jobs. You said I do live in constant fear of what might be. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1124.56s)]
*  I hate letting people down. I hate feeling like I'm not doing the job as well as I should. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1130.96s)]
*  I've got a pretty big weight of responsibility right now. I can't imagine doing much more than [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1134.48s)]
*  that. Now, you said all that before you became leader of your party before you became Prime [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1138.64s)]
*  Minister and before you then became a mum. Yes. How are your anxiety levels? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1142.64s)]
*  Well, and I think when you when you read that, that quote, I like to think that there's probably [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1146.8000000000002s)]
*  a whole group of people that would nod along and say those are natural human emotions. You know, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1152.3200000000002s)]
*  the huge number of people, particularly women often tend to see the deficit what we, you know, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1158.24s)]
*  whether or not we've we're good enough to do the next challenge or the next the next job rather [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1165.5200000000002s)]
*  than the skills and capabilities that we have. I'd like to think that in the jobs that I've done [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1169.76s)]
*  over the years, I've experienced probably pretty normal levels of anxiety. But I was just open [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1174.8s)]
*  about talking about that. And I see. But do you have any any maths or do you have any [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1180.0s)]
*  tricks to manage your anxiety? Oh, yeah, absolutely. And ones that I would promote [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1185.04s)]
*  for just general well being. I talk to people, you know, I talked about I talk with people about [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1189.68s)]
*  some of the things that I'm trying to work through. I think it's a good way of doing politics to it [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1195.36s)]
*  means that I socialize problems that I'm working through. But for me, what's critical is actually [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1199.36s)]
*  being open about even, you know, managing well being issues. I live in a country, we have a [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1205.04s)]
*  serious issue with our mental health and well being. We you know, you've got members of the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1209.84s)]
*  royal family here and now openly talking about those issues, too. You're due to talk alongside [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1214.7199999999998s)]
*  Prince William at Davos about that about mental health and well being. We do need to create a [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1219.04s)]
*  permissive environment where people talk about those issues, because some of the solutions do [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1222.9599999999998s)]
*  lie in us as being more open. This text says I follow Jacinda Ardern's achievements with great [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1228.16s)]
*  joy and her style of politics is beautiful, compelling and compassionate. Thank you for [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1235.44s)]
*  showing the world how strong, powerful and yet loving women can lead the world to a better place. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1239.6000000000001s)]
*  Jay says if only Miss Ardern were leader of our party, what an awesome woman. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  This text says I'm a young woman. I just wanted to send a message to say that [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  Jacinda Ardern has reignited my passionate belief that women can make amazing leaders. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1253.28s)]
*  Laura, text this. I already buy reasonably priced New Zealand lamb, kiwi fruit, wine and butter [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1261.92s)]
*  under present EU trading agreements. Once the UK leaves the EU, what are the likely benefits to [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1268.48s)]
*  the New Zealand economy exporting to the UK under World Trade Organisation tariffs? Yes, and of [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1273.84s)]
*  course your goods would become more expensive. Well, I wouldn't make any assumptions before we [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1281.2s)]
*  have the ability to move into a negotiation. Of course, our goal is to make markets more [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1287.1200000000001s)]
*  accessible for New Zealand products by removing the barriers, and so I wouldn't say that's a [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1293.8400000000001s)]
*  natural byproduct. For us, of course, it is about saying we're complementary. I don't think the [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1298.0800000000002s)]
*  domestic market and the producers of food in the UK need to be nervous about greater access for New [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1303.92s)]
*  Zealand products because, for instance, seasonally we're complementary and so there's a nice synergy [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1309.9199999999998s)]
*  there when you're in winter, we're in summer. So there's benefits between our markets having [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1314.9599999999998s)]
*  greater access to one another. For us as well, we like to add particular quality to our products. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1320.8799999999999s)]
*  Look, take for instance New Zealand lamb. We've got a particular lamb product now that's high in [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1327.52s)]
*  amigas. It's being likened to eating fish, and so we try and create a proposition that can [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1331.12s)]
*  differentiate from products you might otherwise already be able to access. So for us, it is simply [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1336.8s)]
*  about increasing that trading relationship for the benefit of British consumers too because we are [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1343.28s)]
*  free range. We don't like to use hormones, environmentally sustainable products, and so [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1348.56s)]
*  all the better if you're able to access them. Yeah, we'll see what happens. You have been [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1354.0s)]
*  incredibly open. Thank you. You are incredibly open about your family life, about your job. I've [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1358.72s)]
*  watched some of your Facebook lives in the hospital room where you gave birth with your [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1363.12s)]
*  partner in the background. There we are. That's actually, yeah there she is. From your sofa at [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1368.2399999999998s)]
*  home with your sleeping baby on your lap talking about a particular policy on the day it was coming [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1375.1999999999998s)]
*  in, videos from behind the scenes at the UN General Assembly and so on. I did one from the car this [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1379.36s)]
*  morning. Yes, I've seen it. I tweeted it this morning. I saw it. It was a bit dark, but otherwise [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1383.6799999999998s)]
*  it was great. Yes. No reading what someone else has written for you, no autocue, no scripts. It is [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1387.92s)]
*  rather different from other world leaders. Not that I've met that many, but I've seen them. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1395.76s)]
*  Why is being open so important to you? I do think that we're in an era where for a whole [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1401.6000000000001s)]
*  host of reasons people have lost a bit of faith in politicians and political institutions. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1409.28s)]
*  Look, there's no point us hauling over the coals of history to point blame, but now people I think [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1415.04s)]
*  looking for reasons why they don't feel like they're getting ahead or their life isn't what [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1420.96s)]
*  they may feel has been promised from politicians. I think if we're going to restore a little faith, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1426.6399999999999s)]
*  in part it's what we deliver. I do think we need to respond to people's needs, but at the same time, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1431.6s)]
*  we need to be very human about the way we do it. Politicians, ultimately, we are all [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1437.12s)]
*  frail individuals. We're humans. We most of the time go into politics for very genuine reasons. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1441.44s)]
*  I think that there's benefit in just demonstrating that there doesn't have to be a veneer. We're just [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1448.3200000000002s)]
*  doing the best that we can. That you can't be normal. That we can be and are normal. If that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1454.16s)]
*  can restore a little bit of faith in politics because we restore a little bit of faith in [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1460.64s)]
*  politicians, ultimately our democracies are better off. My country is small. Everyone meets me in the [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1464.3200000000002s)]
*  streets or in the supermarket. You can't be two people. Do you have a role model? I have multiple [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1470.64s)]
*  role models. It's going to sound cheesy, but my mum and dad are probably my closest, but there [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1476.64s)]
*  are different politicians over the years. Helen Clark is one of them, just because there's not [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  many people who have done this job. I wonder finally if I could ask you, can you imagine [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1488.0s)]
*  asking your partner, Clark Gafford, to marry you or will you wait for him to ask you? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1496.24s)]
*  I would not ask. No. You're a feminist. Absolutely. Absolutely I'm a feminist. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1502.72s)]
*  No, I want to put him through the pain and torture of having to agonise about that question himself. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  No, that's letting him off the hook. Absolutely not. Fair enough. We await that day. Thank you. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1517.52s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on the programme. Thank you. We really appreciate it. Thanks for [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1522.8s)]
*  your time. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQivl4oneOA&t=1525.4399999999998s)]
