# US and Russia hold talks on Ukraine war in Riyadh | BBC News
**BBC - World News:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA)
*  Well, as those talks that we've been talking about take place in Saudi Arabia between Russia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=0.0s)]
*  and the US, President Zelensky has said that he believes that the Trump administration [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=6.0s)]
*  is after a quick win with the Russians. But he said he didn't regard it as a simple ceasefire, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=10.88s)]
*  as any victory. Meanwhile, European leaders met in Paris on Monday to discuss concerns [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=16.96s)]
*  about the Trump administration's decision to initiate the talks without their involvement. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Keir Starmer has said that he is ready to send UK forces if there is any peace deal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=27.56s)]
*  Let us talk more about this with our correspondents in Kyiv, James Waterhouse. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=34.44s)]
*  In Paris, Andrew Harding. And at Westminster is Hannah Miller. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=39.08s)]
*  If I could start off with you, James, how are these talks going down in Ukraine? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=43.32s)]
*  Well, there are criticisms in these parts of Europe, over Europe not being able to step up [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=49.88s)]
*  where America has challenged it. People really do feel that they've been afraid of Russia to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=57.64s)]
*  this point, which is why it is playing catch up. As for President Zelensky, he's described [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  America as trying to please the Kremlin in trying to get a quick peace deal, as Donald Trump has [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  wanted for some time now. I think the worry here is what that win would be for Washington, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=76.84s)]
*  what that deal might look like. Because at the moment, behind closed doors in Rydia, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  you have discussions that will shape Ukraine's future potentially. And despite American [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=88.44s)]
*  assurances that Ukraine will be involved in this process, the key outcome seems to be a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=94.2s)]
*  subsequent summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. So where does President Zelensky factor [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=100.92s)]
*  into this? And what would he be entering into? Russia, we've heard its maximalist demands going [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  into its meeting. What is Marco Rubio going to say to Sergey Lavrov to counter his demands? What [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  concessions will he try to convince Russia to make? Because we've heard that the Russian [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=121.16s)]
*  make, because all we've heard is what Ukraine is going to have to give up in terms of territory, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=128.52s)]
*  in terms of NATO ambitions. And so it boils down to this for President Zelensky. He is saying, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=133.16s)]
*  we're not going to agree to anything without us being there. We're not going to engage with Russia [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=138.84s)]
*  until there is a clear plan in place. Now, it is one thing to say that, but if America [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=144.28s)]
*  hammers down an agreement primarily focusing on Russia's interests, it leaves Ukraine with a very [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=150.84s)]
*  difficult choice. I think there will always be the desire to fight, there will always be the desire [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=157.16s)]
*  to get the peace that it wants. But if America becomes increasingly disinterested and increasingly [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=161.48s)]
*  favours Moscow in terms of how it would bring this ceasefire to an end, then it could be very messy [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=167.32s)]
*  and uncertain for Ukraine. This isn't by any means an end that people want despite those yearnings [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=172.44s)]
*  for peace. Andrew Harding in Paris, you were monitoring that European leaders meeting yesterday. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=179.48s)]
*  They seem to be split on whether to deploy peacekeepers in the event of any ceasefire. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=185.56s)]
*  Exactly. The British came in saying we potentially could offer peacekeepers for any ceasefire deal [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=191.88s)]
*  to patrol those front lines. France has said nothing on that. Other European nations came out [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=197.96s)]
*  with much more cautious messages, basically saying it is much too early to talk about that. I think [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=204.68s)]
*  there is a general sense in Europe that things need to slow down. The Americans may be pushing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=210.6s)]
*  ahead with their rhetoric, with their plans, their meetings, but I think there's a general understanding [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=215.32s)]
*  that these talks are going to be very slow, very difficult, and Europe doesn't want to get [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  boxed in into offering troops to support a deal that they don't think is going to be a lasting one. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=226.28s)]
*  Very pointedly last night, Emmanuel Macron, very brief comments after the meeting, after which he [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  spoke to Donald Trump and to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he said we don't want this to go back to a repeat [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=240.28s)]
*  of the Minsk agreement, which you may remember back in 2014. This was an agreement between Russia [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=246.6s)]
*  and European nations and Ukraine to try and stabilize and stop the fighting in the east of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=252.44s)]
*  the country after Russia's first invasion, after it first took Crimea and a chunk of the Donbass. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=259.4s)]
*  That agreement, that Minsk agreement, was ultimately a disaster. It allowed Russia to buy time, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=265.24s)]
*  and of course it led to the subsequent invasion. And there's a concern, a deep concern in Europe [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=271.32s)]
*  that the Trump administration, by seeming to want to rush into a quick deal with Putin, might be [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  leading Europe towards another stalled, paused, frozen conflict, which could lead to a renewal [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  of the war in months or years to come. And Hannah Miller, our political correspondent at Westminster, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=292.12s)]
*  we mentioned that Sir Keir Starmer said he's ready to send British troops, but he said also [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=298.52s)]
*  that any deal would need a US backstop. Do we know what that US backstop would be? He was asked about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=302.6s)]
*  that and he was keen to avoid spelling it out, but allies of Keir Starmer have suggested it's likely [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=310.12s)]
*  to mean things like air support, support with logistics, and also intelligence capabilities [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=317.08s)]
*  from the US. Essentially the things that the UK doesn't have in the quantities required, it feels, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=324.68s)]
*  in order for peace to be maintained if it can be achieved in the first place. Keir Starmer has said, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=331.64s)]
*  as you've mentioned, that he would be prepared to put British troops on the ground alongside [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=340.44s)]
*  other countries. I think that is a key part of this and only to ensure a lasting peace. And I [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=347.24s)]
*  think we have to see that in some ways as a way of demonstrating commitment to the US as he tries to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=353.16s)]
*  kind of bridge this divide between the US and Europe and a way of essentially kind of saying, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=361.16s)]
*  look, we really are committed to this, we're prepared to do this, we need to see this from [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=367.32s)]
*  the US as well. There are those in the UK who question the extent to which it will be possible [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=372.92s)]
*  for the British to put significant numbers of troops on the ground given the situation that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=381.88s)]
*  the armed forces are in. But there does seem generally to be public support for that kind of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=389.8s)]
*  move as long as it is alongside other countries as part of a kind of peacekeeping type of effort. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=397.32s)]
*  A YouGov survey yesterday suggested that just over half of people are in favour of that kind of idea, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  only around 20%, one in five would be against it. But I think for Keir Starmer, demonstrating that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  commitment and having the personnel to put in place and keeping people onside at a time when [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=417.08s)]
*  money is tight as well. And there are questions around defence funding and whether that comes at [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=423.0s)]
*  the cost of other public services are all questions that he's going to have to navigate as he tries [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=428.52s)]
*  to bridge what he sees as the divide between Europe and the US. Hannah Miller at Westminster [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  and Andrew Hardy in Paris and our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse who's in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS8F24E7XnA&t=439.4s)]
