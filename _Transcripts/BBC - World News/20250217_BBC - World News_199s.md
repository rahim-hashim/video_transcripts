Video Description: Pope Francis is being treated for a "complex clinical situation" and will remain in hospital for as long as necessary, the Vatican has said.

The 88-year-old was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday to undergo treatment and tests for bronchitis.

The Vatican said the pontiff has a "polymicrobial infection" of his respiratory tract, which has required a change in his treatment, but the Pope was in good spirits.

**BBC - World News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM)
*  Let's move on because another major new story that we're following is that of the health [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=0.0s)]
*  of Pope Francis. Doctors caring for the Pope have changed the course of treatment because [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=4.84s)]
*  of what the Vatican described as a complex clinical situation. The 88-year-old Pope was [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=8.98s)]
*  admitted with bronchitis four days ago and the Vatican said he would remain there for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=14.4s)]
*  as long as necessary. Pope Francis is said to be in good spirits. I'm joined by our [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=18.62s)]
*  correspondent Bethany Bell who's in the Vatican City. Bethany, what more do we know? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=23.36s)]
*  We don't know very much more than what the Vatican has told us. We know that Pope Francis [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=27.36s)]
*  was taken to hospital on Friday. He's been undergoing tests and doctors prescribed complete [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=35.8s)]
*  rest. Yesterday in a post on social media he thanked pilgrims for their affection and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=43.8s)]
*  prayers but he wasn't well enough to appear to give his usual weekly prayer, Angelus prayer, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=51.44s)]
*  to pilgrims. So we're waiting for a further update. We understand it may come today on his [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=57.44s)]
*  health, state of health, but at the moment we do know that doctors have modified his [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  treatment for this respiratory tract infection that he's been suffering from for some days now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=71.6s)]
*  And the Pope who's from Argentina, of course Argentina has spent nearly 12 years [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=79.11999999999999s)]
*  as leader of the Catholic Church. He has had some health issues though hasn't he? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=86.32s)]
*  Yes, in 2023 he was admitted to the same hospital in Rome, the Gemelli hospital, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=93.52s)]
*  which has its own special suite to treat popes. He had a hernia operation then. He's had influenza [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  several times in recent years and as a young man he had pleurisy and had to have part of one of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  his lungs removed. And of course now he's 88 years old. There will be concerns about him suffering [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=116.63999999999999s)]
*  from this infection and it has been the case that in recent appearances, in recent days, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=125.36s)]
*  he did appear to be struggling. He was giving an address on Wednesday which he then asked one of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=132.24s)]
*  his aides to finish. So many people here telling me that they are praying for his health and well-being. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=138.0s)]
*  Traditionally how open are the Vatican in terms of updates on the health of the Pope? Obviously [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=146.64s)]
*  there's always a matter of individual privacy to be balanced with updating all the followers of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=153.68s)]
*  the Catholic Church in particular. It's a very delicate balance. Of course there is the need [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  for privacy. There is also, doctors may well be waiting to see how he responds to new treatment. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=166.96s)]
*  But we have had reports from the Vatican over the weekend saying that his situation was stable. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=176.0s)]
*  Today then we got this new report that he was in what they described as a complex clinical [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=182.96s)]
*  situation and now we wait to hear what the Vatican says again in terms of how he has responded [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=189.52s)]
*  to this treatment. Bethany Bell, thank you very much. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXklKcjXBM&t=196.24s)]
