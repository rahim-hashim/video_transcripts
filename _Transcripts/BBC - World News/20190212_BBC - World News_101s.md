Video Description: Venezuela's embattled President Nicolás Maduro has called Donald Trump's government a "gang of extremists" and blamed the US for his country's crisis.
In an interview with the BBC, Mr Maduro said he would not allow humanitarian aid into Venezuela as it was a way for the US to justify an intervention.
"They are warmongering in order to take over Venezuela," he said.
The US and most Western governments have recognised opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim president.

**BBC - World News:** [February 12, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw)
*  It's a war, Orla, please. I ask God to enlighten you. It's a political war of the American Empire, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=0.0s)]
*  of the interests, of the extreme right that governs today, of the Klu Klux Klan that governs the White House [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=7.0s)]
*  to take over Venezuela. And they have positioned a political strategy, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=15.0s)]
*  communicational, diplomatic, warriorish, to take over Venezuela. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=20.0s)]
*  Do you really think that Klu Klux Klan are ruling America? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=26.0s)]
*  Is President Trump a white supremacist? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=41.0s)]
*  It's an extremist sector that despises the world. They despise us, they see us as less, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=55.0s)]
*  because they only believe in their own interests and in the interests of the United States. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=60.0s)]
*  So, in the battle we are fighting for Venezuela, I tell you, it's a battle that goes beyond our country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=65.0s)]
*  I make a call to the peoples of the world to wake up, to open their eyes, to see that it is an aggression against a pacifist country, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=72.0s)]
*  that Venezuela has problems like many countries in the world, but only in peace. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=80.0s)]
*  We ourselves can solve it. And if you really want to help Venezuela, support peace. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=85.0s)]
*  Tell them no to the intervention, tell them out of the hands of the United States of Venezuela, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=91.0s)]
*  and support Venezuela in its own effort through dialogue to resolve our problems. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4vtQRKLxw&t=96.0s)]
