# Will Iran try to secretly build a nuclear bomb?
**NBC - Middle East:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8)
*  Joining us now we have NBC News international correspondent Matt Bradley. He's joining us live from Tel Aviv and David Road [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC News senior executive editor for national security welcome gentlemen so Matt [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=5.96s)]
*  What's gonna be on the agenda in this meeting Monday between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=10.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this is a pretty consequential meeting [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=17.88s)]
*  It's the third time that Benjamin Netanyahu has actually come to the White House since the president took office [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=20.16s)]
*  He's one of Trump's best customers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=25.52s)]
*  But I think really what we're gonna see here for the most part is a victory lap and Prime Minister Netanyahu made that clear [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=27.36s)]
*  In his statement announcing the visit he is going to be able to say and the Israeli military and the government has been saying [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  that their fight against Iran was an [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=39.04s)]
*  resounding victory for Israel and also Benjamin Netanyahu did something that he always [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=42.08s)]
*  Promises the Israeli people that he's able to do which is bring the United States or the West but mostly the United States in the White [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=46.92s)]
*  House on board with Israel's agenda [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=53.72s)]
*  So this is a victory lap, but it's also gonna be talking a bit about trade issues Benjamin and Yahoo [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=56.58s)]
*  Rushed to Washington to try to secure a trade deal several months ago after the president announced his tariff plan [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=62.22s)]
*  And you know it's also about deepening this relationship that we've really seen gel over just the past couple of months remember Alex [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=68.06s)]
*  It wasn't so long ago that we saw that we thought that Netanyahu and Trump were kind of falling out [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=74.86s)]
*  The president was talking to Iran against Netanyahu's wishes [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=79.34s)]
*  He made a big trip to the Middle East and he didn't stop in Israel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=82.82s)]
*  But now it looks like they're so close [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=86.74s)]
*  But the president is actually publicly defending the Prime Minister Netanyahu from his multiple corruption charges [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=88.74s)]
*  Here in Israel saying that he is as President Trump often styles himself the victim of a witch hunt [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=96.06s)]
*  Exactly I was gonna say the parallels there with what he says he's gone through [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=102.94s)]
*  So putting an exclamation point on this David was it Monday just the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=106.5s)]
*  510 million dollars arms sale to Israel [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  I mean so give me a sense of where the Trump Netanyahu relationship stands right now [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  Matt is on the ground the expert [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=118.86s)]
*  But I agree they seem to be closer than ever and a lot of this is about domestic politics on both sides [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  our colleague Andrew Mitchell talked about if [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=125.34s)]
*  BB can keep making progress he could call an election in Israel and want to you know build off the success of these attacks on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=127.9s)]
*  Iran Trump is pushing for a broad peace deal [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=134.9s)]
*  Across the region that he can somehow bring peace to the Middle East which would be an enormous achievement for him [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=138.1s)]
*  The challenge here is Gaza and Hamas there are still they're still fighting there [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=142.78s)]
*  There's you know questions and many complaints from human rights organizations about the humanitarian situation there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=147.86s)]
*  There are still 50 hostages about half of them believed to be alive that are being held there [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=153.38s)]
*  505-0 and it's extraordinary [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=159.1s)]
*  You know what they've gone through through through all this and at this point the latest reporting we have is that Hamas [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=161.06s)]
*  Will not agree to release those hostages. They will not agree to an Israeli demand that they surrender [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=166.78s)]
*  So that's gonna be the challenge is really addressing Hamas and Gaza at this point [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=171.98s)]
*  Mm-hmm, so Matt you're reporting that Israel is also refocusing on diplomacy in the Middle East after the attacks on Iran [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=175.98s)]
*  What are they trying to achieve now? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=183.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there's a multiple front effort here in diplomacy normally up until now what we've seen is the Israelis have such a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=185.74s)]
*  dominant military ability with all of their theaters of war and no real lasting political solutions in order to try to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=192.26000000000002s)]
*  Essentially resolve these intractable conflicts [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=199.9s)]
*  So now it looks as if the Israelis are actually making a real diplomatic push and not just in the Gaza Strip and we've heard [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We've heard the head of the Israeli military [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=208.86s)]
*  We've heard other top Israeli politicians saying now that we're done with Iran [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=212.06s)]
*  Let's move to try to resolve the situation in the Gaza Strip free the remaining [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  What's thought to be 50 hostages most of which most of whom are human remains only 20 of whom of those 50 are thought to actually be alive [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=218.78s)]
*  But this is something that they're also going to be looking at when it comes to the northern borders of Israel [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=227.34s)]
*  Syria and Lebanon both of those countries having gone through dramatic changes in the case of Syria [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=232.86s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad who was very much connected allied with the Iranian regime [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  He was deposed back late last year in Lebanon [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=243.45999999999998s)]
*  Israel has waged a very about a year and a half long war against Hezbollah [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  Which is an Iran backed militia group and almost entirely defeated them [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  So now Israel feels as though there's a diplomatic opening to try to draw those two countries [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=255.38s)]
*  Into either the Abraham Accords that the president inked with various Middle Eastern countries back in 2012 [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=259.86s)]
*  Or to some other deal that would allow them to have natural or normalized relations with these two Arab neighbors [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=266.26s)]
*  He mentions Iran which brings me to this question to you David with the new satellite images we have there [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=272.26s)]
*  Taken in these days following the US strikes there it looks like there is construction to some degree already happening [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=277.26s)]
*  When these nuclear sites that were that were bombed and we're seeing trucks and the like there are roads that seem to be getting cleared out [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=284.26s)]
*  But reminding everyone the Trump administration says these areas have been obliterated [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=291.26s)]
*  What do the satellite images suggest? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=296.26s)]
*  I think the Iranians are trying to understand the damage themselves when these bombs hit they close the entrances to some of the facilities [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=299.26s)]
*  Where the enriched there are the sorry uranium was being enriched underground [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=306.26s)]
*  So they're digging in to try to go see what's left down there [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=310.26s)]
*  I don't think anyone knows and we don't know what's left down there [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=314.26s)]
*  I don't think anyone knows and we'll it'll take days or weeks for that to be clear [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=318.26s)]
*  But this is a political issue for Trump in the United States as more time goes by you know there's reports over the weekend of Iranian officials [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=323.26s)]
*  It was a Washington Post story saying they were surprised by the limited amount of damage that they had suffered [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=331.26s)]
*  So we have to see as the Iranians themselves get into these areas and then they'll be you know leaks the Israelis have tremendous intelligence [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=336.26s)]
*  It's not clear yet if these you know sites were obliterated and the big question is will Iran try to secretly build a nuclear bomb [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=343.26s)]
*  That is what North Korea did successfully Pakistan did it India and Israel itself has done that and that's really the big question in the weeks and months ahead [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=352.26s)]
*  Yeah, critical question indeed Matt Bradley David Road guys. Thank you so much [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=361.26s)]
*  You [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHaXJlAsXk8&t=373.26s)]
