# What's next for Iran? Ayatollah is 'really the only option' holding regime together: Rhodes
**NBC - Middle East:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM)
*  We want to bring in NBC News international correspondent Raph Sanchez and Ben Rhodes former deputy national security advisor and MSNBC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=0.0s)]
*  Political contributor Raph. I want to start with you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=7.0s)]
*  What are we hearing from Tehran and the White House about the prospects of new nuclear talks and what those terms might look like? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  So Christina the official line from the Iranian government is as far as they are concerns the military [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=17.42s)]
*  Confrontation with the United States is over and they are ready for negotiations [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=22.76s)]
*  Negotiations president Trump of course ordering those strikes on those Iranian nuclear facilities [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  the Iranians shooting back with that ballistic missile attack at the US air base in Qatar and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=30.96s)]
*  Iran's deputy foreign minister telling our own Richard Engel in Tehran last week that they are prepared to draw a line under this and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=36.32s)]
*  To move on to negotiations what has been really interesting Christina over the last couple of days is that the president of Iran? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=43.6s)]
*  Appears to be trying to send a message directly to Donald Trump in a kind of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=51.8s)]
*  America first language that the president would recognize and the medium that he has chosen to send that message is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=56.32s)]
*  Tucker Carlson the former Fox News host who of course is such a big part of the MAGA [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=63.04s)]
*  America first movement the president of Iran sitting down for an interview with Carlson [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=69.72s)]
*  It's just been posted online. It's very long [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=75.28s)]
*  Carlson is from the kind of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=79.08s)]
*  isolationist skeptical of foreign military entanglements wing of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=82.48s)]
*  Trump's coalition and some of the terms that the president of Iran is using seems designed to try to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=87.72s)]
*  Push a wedge between president Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=94.6s)]
*  Just ahead of this meeting just to give you a couple of quotes from this interview [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=99.56s)]
*  The Iranian president says when we were negotiating in good faith at the request of the US Netanyahu dropped bombs literally on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=103.56s)]
*  Diplomacy and he's saying the US must now choose rein in Netanyahu and restore regional peace or follow [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu into another forever war now critics of Iran will raise a lot of questions about [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  The Iranians being champions of regional peace [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=124.56s)]
*  But it is interesting seeing the president of Iran using this America first language right ahead of this meeting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=127.0s)]
*  Christina no kidding rough Sanchez. Thank you so much [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=132.4s)]
*  Ben of course you were really involved in negotiations for the previous nuclear deal the JCPOA brokered by the Obama administration [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=135.68s)]
*  But I want to ask you your take on what rath was just talking about the messaging that you're hearing out of Tehran and combine that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=142.88s)]
*  With the position of the White House, which is kind of altered from you know [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=149.44s)]
*  Absolutely no nuclear program to softening to something that frankly looks a bit more like the JCPOA [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  What is your take on the prospect of a deal and whether it will be easier this time around are harder given the facts as [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=159.16s)]
*  they are [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I I think it's a really interesting context for this meeting today because the reality is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump went along with that strike after Israel started to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  But it did not appear like he went as far as Prime Minister Netanyahu might have wanted him to go [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=178.92s)]
*  So the strike only lasted a day [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  Frankly didn't verify whether or not all those facilities were fully destroyed or whether Iran's nuclear fuel was fully destroyed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=188.05999999999997s)]
*  There's this uncertainty about how far the Iranian nuclear program was set back [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  And certainly didn't go along with a regime change option [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=197.77999999999997s)]
*  Which prime mr. Netanyahu might have wanted to push given how much military supremacy they had and so the question now is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=200.7s)]
*  Do you take a hard line if you're Donald Trump and say, you know [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna stick with Netanyahu in this one [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=212.27999999999997s)]
*  And if we have to bomb these facilities again, if we see the Iranians reconstituting their nuclear program, I'm willing to do that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  Maybe even squeeze this regime out of power if I can or do I pivot back to diplomacy? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=219.94s)]
*  And if you pivot back to diplomacy essentially it seems like the Iranians are offering a deal that is similar to the JCPOA [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  In which there's very strict limitations on their nuclear program [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  There's inspections and verification their nuclear program [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=235.68s)]
*  But there's still some kind of nuclear program inside of Iran [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=238.22s)]
*  And I think that's ultimately the question that's gonna present itself to Trump and it seems like he wants a deal to just get [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=241.84s)]
*  This off his plate. The challenge is actually [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=247.44s)]
*  whether prime mr. Netanyahu [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=250.56s)]
*  Wants to be a spoiler whether he will acquiesce to that deal now that the US has taken this strike [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=252.72s)]
*  Yeah, that'll be interesting to see I also want to ask you about [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=258.44s)]
*  Ayatollah Khomeini. He's obviously he's 86 years old. I spoke recently with a friend who has family in Iran [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=262.2s)]
*  She said even regular Iranians aren't sure how competent he is how dialed in he is whether he's really making these decisions in this most [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=267.12s)]
*  Recent video addressed he appealed he appeared frail, you know [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  He is 86 how in charge is he is he still making decisions for the regime? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=278.76s)]
*  And how do you think what do you think he wants out of all of this? I? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=284.7s)]
*  Mean he's the longest-serving dictator in the world yet [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=290.04s)]
*  Remember, and I think he's probably still the ultimate decision-maker, but look he was not in good health [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  You know back when I was in the White House. I mean he's old there have been all kinds of reports of health problems [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  Clearly he was trying to stay out of the way from airstrikes [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=304.92s)]
*  So he you can have been in the most comfortable place the last few weeks [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  So I think he's still the decision-maker the question is what comes after him [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  There's always been a thought that there'd be a huge power vacuum in Iran after him given the fact that he's been in power for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  So long there were reports that he tried to kind of name potential successors when it seemed like he might be the target of airstrikes [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  But it's also the case that a number of senior Iranian leaders were killed [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  Particularly Iranian Revolutionary Guard leaders who've been powerful over the years [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  That's the more hardline faction have been taken out in airstrikes and then some of the more moderate leaders [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=337.44000000000005s)]
*  The kinds of people that you know would probably be an improvement in terms of wanting to have better relations with the United States in the West [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=342.96s)]
*  Well, they have a hard time appealing to that hardline still for now [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  He's really the only option holding this system together [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=353.44s)]
*  But I'm sure there's a lot of jockeying behind the scenes in Iran [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=356.28s)]
*  And this is gonna be a part of the picture because if you have some kind of collapse there in the regime [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=359.02s)]
*  It's likely that the harder line people are the ones who emerge at the beginning of that which makes it actually even harder [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  To get a deal so Iranian politics is gonna matter a lot as you look ahead [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=369.8s)]
*  Beyond just the next few months because the supreme leader [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=374.68s)]
*  Unlikely to be around for that much longer given his age and his health [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  But for now, I think he's the one who's gonna have to sign off on a deal [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  You saw the president do something pretty clever frankly [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=383.8s)]
*  And if you told me, you know a decade ago that an Iranian president would be sitting on Tucker Carlson [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=386.68s)]
*  I'd be a little surprised but the world's changed [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  but that's the president trying to assert himself as [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=392.92s)]
*  The interlocutor for the United States and it seems like that will probably be the case for these negotiations [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=401.2s)]
*  Iranian officials are clearly trying to take hold of the narrative and and get some points in the messaging because you've also got [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister who's demanding accountability for Israel in the US strikes [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=407.79999999999995s)]
*  He was at a BRICS country summit yesterday [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=412.11999999999995s)]
*  And he said these attacks were a violation of various treaties and UN resolutions the BRICS nation [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  It's it's about ten countries that includes nations like India and Brazil and they actually agreed [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  They issued a joint statement condemning the attacks as a violation of international law [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  So what does that get Iran does that get them any kind of capital on the international stage? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=428.88s)]
*  The other thing that's interesting is Iran's I guess we could use the term allies ish, you know Russia and China [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  They haven't really been there to jump to Iran's defense and all this who are Iran's friends [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=440.72s)]
*  And how do they win this messaging battle? Can they at all? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=445.68s)]
*  No, that's that's a really good point and look their audiences are multiple right? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=449.36s)]
*  There's the United States [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=453.48s)]
*  But then there's the rest of the world much of which is kind of sympathetic to their argument that there was no legal basis [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=454.44s)]
*  For these strikes and Russia and China are at the leadership of that BRICS a coalition of countries [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=459.84s)]
*  And so on the one hand, I think they want to show that they're not diplomatically isolated [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=465.0s)]
*  They have support including from powerful countries frankly some of those countries like Russia and China have [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=469.44s)]
*  You know help them continue to get sources of revenue by not going along with US sanctions by purchasing, you know Iranian oil [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=475.04s)]
*  There's obviously questions too about whether they provided any arms to Iran over the years or suggestions that they have [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=481.88s)]
*  So they do have support word and they want to show that this is actually not them who's isolated in some parts of the world [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=488.12s)]
*  It's the United States and Israel that are viewed as having stepped outside of the boundaries of international law without strike [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=494.94s)]
*  However to your point [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=500.68s)]
*  Russia does not seem to be going out of its way to stick its neck out for the Iranians [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=502.44s)]
*  I'll give you one example [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=506.88s)]
*  Those are Russian air defense systems that were taken out by Israel and then allowing for those strikes [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=507.96s)]
*  If Russia really wanted to help Iran, they could kind of try to get in there and rebuild those air defense systems [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=513.6999999999999s)]
*  We have not seen them do that yet. I think the reason why is Russia's priorities that were in Ukraine right now [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  That's where they're spending all their capital. That's where they're spending all their money. That's where they're pouring all their arms [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=522.92s)]
*  So Russia's focused on that China's focused on a trade war with the United States. So while they do have diplomatic support [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=528.36s)]
*  They don't exactly have people coming to their defense which I think may be the reason why they'll be interested in diplomacy [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=534.48s)]
*  What they'll try to do in that diplomacy though is what you know, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=540.32s)]
*  Raph said they did that interview they'll try to drive a wedge between Trump and Netanyahu [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=543.12s)]
*  Seeing that now is the one was less international support particularly given the war in Gaza [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=547.24s)]
*  Netanyahu is the one who's kind of more eager to go deeper into war with Iran than Trump was [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=551.84s)]
*  So that's probably where they're trying to focus his diplomatic effort [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=556.2s)]
*  All right, Ben Rhodes. Thank you so much [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=560.28s)]
*  You [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW35A2M8QhM&t=564.0s)]
