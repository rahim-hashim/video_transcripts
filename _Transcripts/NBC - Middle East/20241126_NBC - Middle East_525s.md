# Lawrence: Biden says Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire is proof 'peace is possible'
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc)
*  Well, in this morning's New York Times, columnist Thomas Friedman, who will join our discussion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=0.0s)]
*  tonight, wrote, this is a big deal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=4.46s)]
*  He was referring just to the possibility that President Biden's special envoy, Amos Hochstein, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  who will also join our discussion tonight, was on the verge of negotiating a ceasefire [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=14.88s)]
*  between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=20.64s)]
*  Then at 3.38 p.m. today, this happened. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=23.36s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=29.28s)]
*  Today I have some good news to report from the Middle East. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  I just spoke with the Prime Minister of Israel and Lebanon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=48.08s)]
*  I'm pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States proposal to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=52.96s)]
*  the deal reached today, effective at 4 a.m. tomorrow local time, the fighting across the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Lebanese-Israeli border will end, will end. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=67.84s)]
*  This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=72.48s)]
*  Earlier in the day, in Lebanon, it did not seem that peace was at hand. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=77.4s)]
*  The New York Times reports, in the hours before Israeli ministers approved the deal, the Israeli [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=83.28s)]
*  military launched one of its heaviest barrages of airstrikes since the war began, hitting [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=88.56s)]
*  the heart of Beirut and Hezbollah-dominated neighborhoods south of the city. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=94.62s)]
*  Thomas Friedman writes that the deal means that, quote, Hezbollah and, by extension, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Iran have decided to delink themselves from Hamas in Gaza and stop the firing from Lebanon [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=105.44s)]
*  for the first time since October 8, 2023, the day after Hamas invaded Israel. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=113.26s)]
*  President Biden pointed out today that this has been the deadliest conflict between Israel [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=122.54s)]
*  and Hezbollah in decades. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=127.9s)]
*  NBC News reports that approximately 1.2 million people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in northern [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=129.82s)]
*  have been driven from their homes because of the attacks across the border. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=139.12s)]
*  This deal supports Lebanon's sovereignty, and so it heralds a new start for Lebanon, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=144.8s)]
*  a country that I've seen most of over the years, a country with rich history and culture. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=151.28s)]
*  If fully implemented, this deal can put Lebanon on a path toward a future that's worthy of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  its significant past. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=162.44s)]
*  Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=165.76s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  They too deserve an end to the fighting and displacement. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=172.82s)]
*  The people of Gaza have been through hell. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=176.12s)]
*  Their world is absolutely shattered. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  Far too many civilians in Gaza have suffered far too much, and Hamas has refused for months [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=184.12s)]
*  and months to negotiate a good faith ceasefire and a hostage deal. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=190.24s)]
*  So now Hamas has a choice to make. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=196.88s)]
*  Their only way out is to release the hostages, including American citizens, which they hold. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=200.28s)]
*  In the process, bring an end to the fighting, which would make possible a surge of humanitarian [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=206.36s)]
*  relief. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=212.72s)]
*  President Biden acknowledged that there is much more work to do to bring peace to the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=215.24s)]
*  region, but he said today's deal is proof that peace is possible. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  Now Israel must be bold in turning tactical gains against Iran and its proxies into a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=227.16s)]
*  coherent strategy that secure Israel's long-term, its long-term safety and advances a broader [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=232.36s)]
*  peace and prosperity in the region. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=240.58s)]
*  Today's announcement is a critical step in advancing that vision, and so I applaud the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=243.68s)]
*  crazy decision made by the leaders of Lebanon and Israel to end the violence. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  It reminds us that peace is possible. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  Say that again, peace is possible. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  As long as that is the case, I will not for a single moment stop working to achieve it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=260.8s)]
*  The United States led the ceasefire negotiations, and the lead negotiator for President Biden [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  in the negotiations is our first guest tonight, Amos Huckstein. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  He began working in Washington as a young staffer in the House of Representatives, then [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=278.36s)]
*  served in the Obama administration and now the Biden administration. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=281.88s)]
*  If you're hearing his name for the first time tonight, you're not the only one. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=285.7s)]
*  He's one of those people working good government who are not there for the attention. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=290.64s)]
*  But he's much better known in the places where people's lives depend on how well he [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=295.94s)]
*  could do his job in achieving a ceasefire. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=301.94s)]
*  People in Beirut, with their lives at stake in the ceasefire negotiations, know all about [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=305.98s)]
*  Amos Huckstein. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=311.56s)]
*  And so, when he showed up at a Starbucks in Beirut last week, people working there were [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=313.26s)]
*  so grateful that he was trying to stop the fighting that they refused to let him pay [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=318.62s)]
*  despite his best efforts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=325.70000000000005s)]
*  Leading off our discussion tonight is White House Senior Advisor Amos Huckstein. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=344.1s)]
*  He served as the lead U.S. negotiator in the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=348.22s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us tonight. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=353.06s)]
*  How did it turn out at the Starbucks? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=355.58000000000004s)]
*  Did they let you pay? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=357.18s)]
*  Thanks, Lawrence. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=359.18s)]
*  No, they wouldn't let me pay. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=361.18s)]
*  They kept saying you're our guest and we appreciate what you're trying to do. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=363.02000000000004s)]
*  We won't let you pay. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  As Tom Friedman says, this is a big deal. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=368.62s)]
*  It's very obviously a big deal now that it has really happened. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=371.74s)]
*  What would you say was the key to bringing it together in the end? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=376.62s)]
*  Look, I think, Lawrence, this has been a devastating conflict. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=382.18s)]
*  18 years of calm since the 2006 war. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=386.26s)]
*  And here we are again. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=390.58s)]
*  And really, this is a conflict, as the president said today, that was imposed on the Lebanese people. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=392.58s)]
*  October 7th happened and Hamas attacked Israel. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=397.7s)]
*  And Hezbollah decided to join in on the attack a few hours later, on the early morning of October 8th, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  not representing the Lebanese people who repeatedly through this year have expressed, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=408.97999999999996s)]
*  we don't want this war. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=414.02s)]
*  We didn't want it then. We don't want it now. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=415.26s)]
*  So really it was about how do you get to a point of telling the Israelis, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=417.78s)]
*  look, you've gotten a lot of gains on the ground militarily, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=422.34s)]
*  but you need, if you really want security, you got to leverage your gains on the battlefield to political gains [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=426.78s)]
*  because your ultimate security is only through an agreement with Lebanon, not by imposing it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  And the same thing for the Lebanese. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=439.62s)]
*  At some point, you got to say, look, enough is enough. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=441.1s)]
*  And we are willing to take the steps that are difficult, perhaps politically in Lebanon, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=444.3s)]
*  but to say we're going to assert control over our own country and we're going to care about our own people. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  And the style of negotiations that I tried to have here was to say to people, look, what do you really want? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=454.38s)]
*  What is important to you and for Israel to return their people home with security? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=460.06s)]
*  And for the Lebanese, it's to end this war and to rebuild the shattered lives. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=465.5s)]
*  And if we can find a path that sort of threads the needle, I thought we could do it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=470.53999999999996s)]
*  And we were able to do it. But I will tell you, it was not easy. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=476.78s)]
*  This was a very difficult, difficult negotiation, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  partly because the involvement of Iran and Hezbollah and other forces from the outside. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=484.38s)]
*  But I'm glad we're able to do it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=489.5s)]
*  And I think we're, by doing it now, able to save a lot of lives that would have been injured and killed over the coming days, weeks and months. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QlGvXOsIdc&t=490.78s)]
