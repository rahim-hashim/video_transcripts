# Trump highlights Russia's support for Assad amid Syria crisis
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w)
*  So, Donald Trump is calling out Russia for their role in propping up the Assad regime, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=0.0s)]
*  writing on Truth Social that Bashar al-Assad reportedly fled the country because, quote, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Putin was not interested in protecting him any longer. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=11.92s)]
*  Trump went on to call for a ceasefire in Ukraine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=15.82s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris before the grand [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=18.96s)]
*  reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now is The Guardian's senior political correspondent, Hugo Lowell, and Atlanta Journal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=28.4s)]
*  constitutional columnist Sophia Nelson. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=34.92s)]
*  It is good to see you both, Hugo. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=38.24s)]
*  Let me start with you, show you this poll from Politico. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=39.76s)]
*  After Trump was late, Zelensky-McCrone trilateral was all smiles and handshakes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=43.54s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron achieved a diplomatic milestone Saturday, hosting the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=47.96s)]
*  first in-person meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and United States [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=51.96s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump since he won the election in November. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=55.72s)]
*  Talk to me both about the stakes and the way that the president-elect is positioning himself. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=59.72s)]
*  What was fascinating about that meeting was the fact that they brought everyone together [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=63.96s)]
*  for the trilateral, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=67.32s)]
*  And this is Europe rolling out the carpet for him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=68.88s)]
*  And, you know, he got a Trump got a number one spot at the Notre Dame opening. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=71.68s)]
*  He got one of the best seats. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=76.28s)]
*  And this is like Macron and the EU people and NATO saying, we really want you to be [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=77.72s)]
*  on our side here because for us, it really matters. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=82.72s)]
*  Europeans have a very long history of having to fight off aggression from the East, you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=85.28s)]
*  know, Russia in particular. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=89.8s)]
*  And so this matters a lot to Europeans, I think, in a way that sometimes maybe [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  members of Congress and senators don't always comprehend and how big of a deal it is for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  the EU and for NATO in particular. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  And it was interesting how they brought everyone together in that moment to have [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=102.32s)]
*  Macron and Zelensky and then them showing a united front to say, look, you might be [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  coming in as the incoming president, but we are all united. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=113.84s)]
*  So you have to deal with all of us and you have to deal with all of us wanting to support [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=117.12s)]
*  Ukraine in ongoing conflicts and now also in Syria. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=121.92s)]
*  And I think that was a very deliberate moment, obviously. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=125.4s)]
*  But I think it was one that carried extra significance. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=129.0s)]
*  So, Sophia, to Hugo's point, it matters a lot to our European allies. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=132.0s)]
*  It matters a lot to Macron. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=137.44s)]
*  But does it matter to Donald Trump? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=140.16s)]
*  Donald Trump, in that setting, has a very different view of the men in that room, that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=143.08s)]
*  he, you know, and a very different view of the situation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=152.52s)]
*  Now, on the heels of that, you have Syria this morning. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=157.12s)]
*  Assad is out. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=163.24s)]
*  HTS is on the ground and controlling things, the rebels. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=165.08s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans in Congress are now considering appointees of this incoming [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  administration, specifically with respect to the director of national intelligence, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=178.56s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. What's your assessment at this point? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  When you look at this, and I'll give you a little bit of help. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=190.8s)]
*  It's a lot, Michael. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=194.88s)]
*  I know. I know. I know. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=195.55999999999997s)]
*  It's Sunday morning. You can handle it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=197.76s)]
*  I got it. Let's go. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  Gabbard has, you know, been reported by NBC. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=200.92s)]
*  Gabbard has been accused of repeatedly echoing propaganda spread by Russia and the Assad [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=203.56s)]
*  regime, including questioning U.S. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  intelligence assessments that the Syrian government carried out multiple chemical weapons [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  attacks on its own people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=214.32s)]
*  So there are records. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=215.92s)]
*  There's a history of Gabby and Assad in Syria. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  What's your take on all of this? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=223.48s)]
*  Well, it's Sunday morning. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=225.52s)]
*  So there is a guide. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=226.68s)]
*  And I say that because this couldn't be a worse series of events for Tulsi Gabbard's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=228.04s)]
*  nomination than what's unfolding in Syria right now. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=233.24s)]
*  Positive in that, I think we all agree that Assad was a dictatorist, horrible, vicious [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=236.4s)]
*  leader, and I'm glad he's been deposed. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=243.0s)]
*  I don't think we know what that looks like yet. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=245.2s)]
*  And I think it does have to play out to echo Trump's sentiments on Twitter yesterday. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=247.48s)]
*  But I think that the bottom line here is I think this helps to sink her nomination and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=252.44s)]
*  give the Republican Senate more of a ability to have that backbone to say, yeah, I don't [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=256.8s)]
*  think she's the right person, particularly at this moment. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=263.28s)]
*  And it'll be interesting to see what they do. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=266.32s)]
*  I'm not optimistic, but I do think that there will be a lot of pressure to not have her [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=268.36s)]
*  be there. I think to your broader question of does it matter to Donald Trump what the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=272.4s)]
*  EU is doing, what Europe is doing? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that Macron and the new prime minister of the UK and others in NATO will have to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=279.04s)]
*  stand shoulder to shoulder, like you said, and they will have to push him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=285.76s)]
*  Say, listen, you know, we're going to go it alone if you don't line up with the rest of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=289.36s)]
*  the world. But you know, Trump, I don't know that that's going to be much of a persuasive [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=294.04s)]
*  stick, if you will, to him to get him in line because he does what he wants to do. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=299.56s)]
*  So, Michael, Hugo, Sophia, as we are on air, we have some breaking news, a statement by [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=303.72s)]
*  Putin's press secretary, quote, We have carefully read the statement which the U.S. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=308.48s)]
*  president elect Donald Trump delivered. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=312.84s)]
*  Russia is open to negotiations on Ukraine and welcomes peace initiatives coming. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=315.08s)]
*  Your reaction? It's quite an extraordinary moment, actually, because if you think about [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=321.04s)]
*  it, I wonder if this is a setback on multiple fronts for Russia and how Trump is going to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=325.08s)]
*  deal with this. You'll have to see right because Russia obviously has substantial interest. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=329.4s)]
*  Let's just deal with Syria for the moment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=332.92s)]
*  They have bases there. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=335.04s)]
*  The fact that they pull back their support from Assad and the fact that they may have to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=336.6s)]
*  now pull back their presence in Syria is one thing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=341.8s)]
*  But the fact that they now have to pull back their presence potentially from Ukraine suggests [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=344.32s)]
*  they're on the back foot. I think this is an incredible opportunity, frankly, for Trump to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=347.92s)]
*  step in if he wants to. You know, this is the guy, by the way, that has been promising that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  he's going to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  But I think Trump, for the first time, maybe has the upper hand. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=358.32s)]
*  And we'll see how he how he responds to this, because obviously he's not the president yet. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  And what the contours of those negotiations are given the folks we know he has already [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=367.72s)]
*  brought into his inner circle, who would be part of those negotiations should he be the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=371.68s)]
*  one to lead them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=375.72s)]
*  And I wonder I wonder about the timing as well on a different note, because, you know, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  from Russia's perspective, you see kind of Biden's term coming to an end, you see Trump [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  coming in, you see people like Tulsi Gabbard, who you think might be a little sympathetic [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=384.12s)]
*  to Russia. And I wonder if this is, you know, kind of processing in real time here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  But I also wonder if this is Russia saying, oh, you know, we're on the back foot, but we [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=391.24s)]
*  might have a sympathetic administration coming in. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=394.8s)]
*  Now's the time to start making overtures. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=397.28s)]
*  It's actually not very reminiscent of 2016. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=399.12s)]
*  If you remember what happened then, you know, they were they were having their own [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  communications. The Trump transition was having communications with the Russian embassy [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  in Washington. And I wonder if this is a repeat tactic of an attempt to get around the current [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=410.2s)]
*  administration and curry favor with Trump in advance. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=415.2s)]
*  The thing that's interesting, though, in light of this of this new news, Sophia, is [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  what what is the Biden administration doing? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=425.08s)]
*  I mean, you know, Trump is not the president. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  He's the president elect. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  And yet everyone seems to be like moving in this space as if he is. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=432.52s)]
*  And I get that part of it. He's an incoming administration and he's so volatile and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=438.24s)]
*  unpredictable. People want to try to put a lid on as much of his of his crazy as they [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=443.0s)]
*  can. But you still have a sitting president right down the street here. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=448.28s)]
*  You know, what's I mean, how does Biden deal with this? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=455.44s)]
*  Because Biden, at this point, in my view, given these developments, could probably [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=458.12s)]
*  bring to a closure a number of things in 24 hours, you know, if he really wanted to. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=463.28s)]
*  I think two things. One, the deal that Trump and Putin are going to want to offer is a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=467.72s)]
*  linsky is one he can't accept because it's going to mean conceding territory. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=472.68s)]
*  And it's also going to mean saying he's not going to join NATO. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8rJU1Ui4w&t=477.04s)]
