# ‘A lot of verification’ that he’s alive: Mother of missing journalist Austin Tice speaks out
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw)
*  The chaos after the collapse of the Assad regime has raised new hope that there could [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=0.0s)]
*  be a new opportunity to finally find missing American journalist Austin Tice, who was abducted [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=5.12s)]
*  12 years ago while covering Syria's civil war. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  In a letter obtained by NBC News, Tice's mother, Deborah, writes to Israel's Prime Minister [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=14.8s)]
*  Netanyahu that her family has, quote, credible information that Austin may be held in a prison [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  outside of Damascus. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=25.34s)]
*  He's asking Netanyahu to pause Israeli military strikes in that area to allow rescuers to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=27.32s)]
*  search for her son. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=32.52s)]
*  And I am so pleased to have joining me now is Austin's mother, Deborah Tice. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Deborah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=40.6s)]
*  So nice to be here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=41.6s)]
*  Now, thank you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=42.6s)]
*  And for everything you are doing, I can't imagine how painful and how difficult, but [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  you are just ferocious as an advocate for your son. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=51.2s)]
*  And that is exactly what needs to be done. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=56.48s)]
*  I think it's just what a mother would do, right? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, and in this light, let me ask you about the letter to Prime Minister Netanyahu, which [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=63.4s)]
*  was sent over the weekend. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=68.36s)]
*  The Israelis are all over Syria, and they've also been bombing on a daily basis. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu visited the Golan Heights, the buffer area there today with his defense minister. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=76.16s)]
*  So have you gotten any response or do you have any indication that this letter did get [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  to him? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=85.96s)]
*  Yes, I've had an indication that he did receive that letter. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=86.96s)]
*  It has been dispersed widely, and there was a response to the United States government. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  Our understanding right now is that there has been a pause so that these places can [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  be searched. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=107.88s)]
*  Who were the rescuers searching for Austin Tice? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=109.52s)]
*  They're really searching for the hidden cells, because there are a lot of them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=113.28s)]
*  And so that's kind of at first they went into, of course, Sinaiya, and you saw the people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=120.44s)]
*  pouring out of there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=126.4s)]
*  And there are other prisons that were also known and full. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=128.24s)]
*  And so it was important to do those first. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=134.46s)]
*  And now there's more of looking for this sort of hidden one under and behind thing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=137.48s)]
*  And you write in the letter that this prison has a secret tunnel which connects to the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=144.76s)]
*  Al-Maliki neighborhood to the Republic Palace. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=150.12s)]
*  Is that the presidential palace you're referring to? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=157.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  I've been to that palace when it was first opened with President Clinton. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  Have you? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=163.48s)]
*  I've been to the palace of Tafas Al-Assad, Bashar Al-Assad's father. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=164.48s)]
*  And you think that the prison could be located underneath the military museum that you refer [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=170.6s)]
*  to here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  Do you know if anyone has been able to get there? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  They have been up. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=179.44s)]
*  They were able to go through the tunnel and go up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=181.6s)]
*  But in the absence of the bombing, they'll be able to make a more thorough search inside [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=185.44s)]
*  the mountain. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=196.76s)]
*  You have suggested publicly, and the president repeated this, President Biden repeated this, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=198.48s)]
*  that Austin Tice is alive. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=205.48s)]
*  Right, yes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's what I say. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=208.56s)]
*  He was born alive and has been ever since. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=210.56s)]
*  So yeah, and we've had a lot of verification that he's hanging in there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=213.56s)]
*  Now, the French and the Brits are going in now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=220.28s)]
*  They are trying to make contact with the new military leader, even though he's under terror [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=223.8s)]
*  designation from the United Nations and from the U.S. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=229.96s)]
*  There's an effort by him, certainly, to moderate his position. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=233.32s)]
*  And there is some pressure for the U.S. to lift its designation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=237.28s)]
*  Do you think the U.S. should be lifting that designation so that we can deal with him more [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=240.76s)]
*  directly? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  I've been thinking that for quite a while. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=246.16s)]
*  Yeah, I really don't think silence is the best way forward. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  Let me play something that the State Department spokesman said yesterday when asked if we're [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  going in, if the U.S. is going in on the ground. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=258.2s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=260.68s)]
*  No U.S. government organization has been on the ground in Syria as of yet. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=262.64s)]
*  We have been in communication with groups on the ground in Syria, and that includes [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=268.16s)]
*  not just HTS, but other groups in Syria, including the White Helmets, of course, who do a lot [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=272.6s)]
*  of important work on locating detainees, and other civil society groups about the search [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  for Austin Tice. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=283.0s)]
*  Is that good enough with no U.S. government people on the ground? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, this is how I feel about that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  There are a lot of people on the ground, and there are a lot of people that are searching. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=293.88s)]
*  We work with hostage aid worldwide. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=298.16s)]
*  They are on the ground. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=301.4s)]
*  They are fully fluent in Arabic, and they want to be there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=302.8s)]
*  They want to be there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=308.04s)]
*  They want to be looking for Austin. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=309.04s)]
*  You know, I have seven children, and I found that if you're pushing someone to do something [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=312.12s)]
*  they really don't want to do, you're not going to get a good job anyway. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=316.72s)]
*  And so, you know, for the people that dove right in and got right in there, those are [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=321.64s)]
*  the ones that we want to have working for us. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=326.88s)]
*  The implicit suggestion is that you think it could backfire if you tried to push the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  administration more, but should they be there? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=334.96s)]
*  I've been pushing for 12 years and four months, and apparently I don't have much strength [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=339.56s)]
*  in my arms, I would say. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=344.84s)]
*  At this point, your hopes are pinned on the hostage rescue people. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  Our own Richard Engel, as you saw, went in and found a cell that he had been told by [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=357.56s)]
*  a very good source had been a place that he had been held in as recently as 2022. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=362.72s)]
*  Yes, and we were able to verify that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  He was in that prison in 2022. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=371.32s)]
*  My children and I, because of something that was written on the wall, we do think that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=377.72s)]
*  Austin may have been in that specific cell. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=383.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=386.16s)]
*  I saw the wall paintings, and Richard was pointing that out, was showing it now on the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=387.16s)]
*  screen, and I was wondering if there was anything that you could identify from that imagery, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  that either was his handwriting or some coded message? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=395.12s)]
*  Well, and, you know, it wouldn't be his handwriting, because, you know, they're kind of scratching [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=398.68s)]
*  in, but there was something there that really seemed to us like Austin. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  That's so encouraging. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=411.76000000000005s)]
*  The thing that they didn't have, they didn't have blue light, and if you have blue light, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=414.04s)]
*  you can see other things that are written on the wall. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  So I think they now have that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  We let them know that they needed to get that, and so, you know, we might get some more information. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=423.72s)]
*  Deborah Tice, you are remarkable. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=431.48s)]
*  I mean, it's just, you know, you're all over this, and of course you are, because you have [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=433.48s)]
*  seven children, and one of them has been held for 12 years, and this is such a great opportunity. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=441.8s)]
*  So our hearts are with you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's hope for a wonderful holiday season. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=451.24s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=453.44s)]
*  When all my children were here this last weekend, the whole, where Austin belongs, was so, I [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=454.48s)]
*  mean, being all together made that absence so much more profound and painful, actually. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=462.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=472.36s)]
*  Our hearts are with you. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=473.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=475.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=476.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=477.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXuZcK7yfw&t=484.44s)]
