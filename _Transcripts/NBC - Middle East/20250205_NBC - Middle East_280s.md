# The type of rhetoric that can unite the Middle East: Trump proposes U.S. control of Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA)
*  Let's go live to Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Yasmin Vesugin is standing by there. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=2.32s)]
*  Yasmin, what's the reaction that you're hearing so far? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=5.88s)]
*  I think, Mika, it's important to be frank about the situation here in the Middle East. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=11.36s)]
*  And it feels as if President Trump has literally dropped a nuclear bomb on the Middle East. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=15.6s)]
*  Lamir is right in that Donald Trump campaigned on getting the United States out of foreign [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=21.44s)]
*  wars. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=27.68s)]
*  It feels as if, after yesterday evening, standing aside, Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=29.22s)]
*  Donald Trump may very well have gotten the United States into another war. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=34.74s)]
*  This is the type of rhetoric that will unite, that can feasibly unite the Middle East. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=39.8s)]
*  We have heard from MBS of Saudi Arabia denouncing what Donald Trump has said. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=48.3s)]
*  We have heard, obviously, from Islamic militants, from the Palestinian Authority to Islamic [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=54.3s)]
*  Jihad to Hamas, who have all understandably denounced what Donald Trump has said. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=59.12s)]
*  We have heard Iran denouncing what Donald Trump has said, even from Egypt and the foreign [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=65.56s)]
*  minister, not necessarily directly addressing, but instead saying, we will continue to rebuild [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=72.64s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=79.28s)]
*  As Richard mentioned, we know that the Jordanian king will be heading to Washington on February [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=81.24s)]
*  11. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  The president of Egypt heading to Washington Thursday as well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, Donald Trump wanted to bring key players to try and put this plan into motion. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=91.02s)]
*  But across the Middle East, there is a real deep dissatisfaction and anger with what President [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=97.5s)]
*  Trump is proposing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=106.46s)]
*  And yet, if you look to the right wing of the Israeli government, they, in fact, are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=108.18s)]
*  celebrating this notion of the United States taking over Gaza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=114.2s)]
*  But it's the Israeli citizens that I've spoken to here in Tel Aviv and the Palestinians in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=120.06s)]
*  Gaza, who our team on the ground has spoken to as well, who also think this idea is out [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=125.66000000000001s)]
*  of the realm of possibility and not something anyone wants for a real lasting people. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=131.54000000000002s)]
*  Let's take a listen to them, Mika, and then we'll talk on the other side. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=136.82s)]
*  We can't leave our homes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  How we can't, how you dare, how dare you to say you should leave your homes? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  We can't, we can't. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=148.54s)]
*  This is Palestine. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=150.16s)]
*  And we Palestinians are the only ones who have the right to live here and never to leave [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=151.74s)]
*  it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=158.82s)]
*  We will never leave our town. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=159.82s)]
*  Palestine for us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=162.7s)]
*  This is never changing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=163.7s)]
*  I mean, there are people live there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=165.14s)]
*  There is Gazan civilians who lives in Gaza. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=166.5s)]
*  I don't understand the idea of just taking over. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=169.06s)]
*  Richard is right, is that it feels as if Donald Trump is forgetting about history. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=174.38s)]
*  One of the reasons why Hamas Mika came into power in 2006 is because Hamas essentially [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  promised infrastructure, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=182.62s)]
*  They promised schooling, they promised food, they promised aid, the person, the people, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=184.22s)]
*  the organizations, the country that will win the hearts and the minds, for instance, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  of the Palestinians remaining on their land will be the people that are providing them [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=192.58s)]
*  with the infrastructure, the aid, the food, the water that they desperately need. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=196.86s)]
*  The infrastructure, for instance, to rebuild. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  I just want to say one final thing, right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=202.94s)]
*  As we were looking to Los Angeles and the wildfires that happened there in the palaces, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  you saw major destruction and people were incredibly upset over losing their personal [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=208.62s)]
*  belongings and their homes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  But it was really about the community, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  The churches, the schools, the coffee shops in which so many of them convened. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=215.94s)]
*  These Gazans have walked, marched, driven thousands of miles, right, back to their homes [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  in North Gaza after this ceasefire to commune in rubble because this is their homeland. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=226.86s)]
*  This is where they want to remain, not because of the structures in which they have lived in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  Mika, but because of the community they have been surrounded by, the families and the people [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=238.38000000000002s)]
*  they know. And that, it seems, is something that is being lost by both the president of the United [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  States, along with Prime Minister Bimini Netanyahu Mika. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=249.06s)]
*  NBC's Yasmin Vesugian, thank you so much for your coverage live from Tel Aviv. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=253.9s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofOdv_INsUA&t=258.78000000000003s)]
