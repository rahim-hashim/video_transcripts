# Estimated That 250 U.S. Citizens Remain In Afghanistan
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU)
*  There is a high likelihood of additional attacks between now and the 31st. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=0.0s)]
*  What I can tell you is this, and we met again this morning with the president and our top [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=7.2s)]
*  commanders both in the field and, of course, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the secretary [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=12.46s)]
*  of defense. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=17.16s)]
*  And I know that they are taking every possible precaution to keep our men and women safe. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=18.28s)]
*  But this is the most dangerous time in an already extraordinarily dangerous mission. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=23.88s)]
*  These last couple of days. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=29.14s)]
*  And so we will do everything possible to keep people safe. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=30.94s)]
*  But the risk is very high. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  I had the secretary of state Antony Blinken yesterday warning of another possible terror [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=36.26s)]
*  threat in Afghanistan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=40.38s)]
*  The United States military is fending off more attacks against Kabul's main airport [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=41.86s)]
*  there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=46.540000000000006s)]
*  Rocket fire apparently targeting Kabul's international airport struck a nearby neighborhood on the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  eve of the deadline for American troops to withdraw from the country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=52.22s)]
*  As many as five of the rockets, according to the Washington Post, were intercepted by [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  a missile defense system. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=59.739999999999995s)]
*  The barrage did not halt the steady stream of U.S. military C-17 cargo jets taking off [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  and landing at Hamid Karzai International Airport. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=67.56s)]
*  In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Biden had been briefed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=71.08s)]
*  on the thwarted attack, writing in part, the president was informed operations continue [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=75.02s)]
*  uninterrupted at Hamid Karzai International Airport and has reconfirmed his order that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=79.66s)]
*  commanders redouble their efforts to prioritize doing whatever is necessary to protect our [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=84.24s)]
*  forces on the ground. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  U.S. forces conducted a drone strike against a vehicle carrying multiple suicide bombers [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=91.44s)]
*  from Afghanistan's Islamic State affiliate ISIS-K. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=96.44s)]
*  This was yesterday before those people could attack the ongoing military evacuation at [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  the airport. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=105.08s)]
*  The Associated Press reports an Afghan official speaking on the condition of anonymity said [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  three children were killed in the strike. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  According to a senior U.S. official, the United States military drone fired a missile at [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=113.36s)]
*  a vehicle in a compound between two buildings after individuals were seen loading explosives [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=117.64s)]
*  into the truck. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=123.28s)]
*  The official said there was an initial explosion caused by the missile, followed by a much [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=124.28s)]
*  larger fireball, perhaps by the explosives inside the vehicle. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=129.34s)]
*  Spokesman for Central Command said, quote, substantial and powerful subsequent explosions [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=133.92s)]
*  resulted from the destruction of the vehicle, which may have caused additional casualties. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=138.2s)]
*  He added the military is investigating further and, quote, we would be deeply saddened by [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=142.76s)]
*  any potential loss of innocent life. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  ISIS-K took responsibility for the suicide bombing at Kabul airport on Thursday, killed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  13 U.S. service members and at least 169 Afghans. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News foreign correspondent Matt Bradley. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=160.16s)]
*  He's live in Landstuhl, Germany, overlooking Ramstein Air Base, the destination for most [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=163.28s)]
*  of the evacuating flights from Afghanistan. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  So Matt, we are literally on the eve of the evacuation, one day left before the American [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=170.76s)]
*  forces leave Afghanistan. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  What does the traffic look like into Ramstein right now? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=177.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, we're actually we're still seeing that traffic, obviously. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is still going on at pace. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=184.6s)]
*  I mean, we're still seeing commercial airlines taking off. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  We're still seeing some of those C-7, C-17, C-130s landing here, bringing evacuees. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  So what we're hearing now is that as of about 7.30 a.m. this morning, that there are now [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=197.2s)]
*  15,000 Afghan evacuees who are living at that base. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=200.48s)]
*  This is a moving target. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=205.64s)]
*  And in the next 12 hours, they said they're expecting about 1,700 to arrive and about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=206.64s)]
*  2,000 to leave. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=215.2s)]
*  Notice how that has changed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=217.0s)]
*  So now they're expecting fewer to arrive in the next 12 hours than will be leaving. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=218.0s)]
*  And it used to be more that they were accepting more and more and more and fewer and fewer [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=224.52s)]
*  were taking off. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=228.24s)]
*  Now it's the opposite. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  It looks like that evacuation effort is kind of starting to slow down and push more in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=230.62s)]
*  the direction of people moving on from Ramstein towards the United States, almost most of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  them to Dulles Airport in Virginia, rather than just more of accepting and accepting [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=241.08s)]
*  in that tent city that we were walking through the other day, growing larger and larger and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=246.54000000000002s)]
*  larger. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=250.4s)]
*  This base is at capacity. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=252.28s)]
*  15,000 evacuees are still here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=254.68s)]
*  That number is probably going to stay around there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=257.24s)]
*  That's about as much as they can take. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=259.8s)]
*  And now we're hearing that there are evacuees who are going to Sigonella. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  That's a Navy air base in Italy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=265.22s)]
*  And Rota, that's a base in Spain. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=267.92s)]
*  We're talking about a couple thousand there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=270.92s)]
*  And that's because they just can't take that much more here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=272.6s)]
*  And they do need to stop off. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=275.74s)]
*  They need to stop off in Europe so they can be processed by the State Department before [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=277.1s)]
*  they finally move on to the U.S., Willie. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=281.62s)]
*  And we know, Matt, there are still some Americans left in Afghanistan with one day left of these [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=284.16s)]
*  evacuations and many, many Afghans who would like to leave the country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=288.68s)]
*  What happens to them as this deadline is met, as President Biden has promised on the 31st, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=293.44s)]
*  which is tomorrow? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=298.62s)]
*  What happens on Wednesday, on September 1st, to those left behind? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=303.62s)]
*  You know, I don't really know. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=305.64s)]
*  And I've spoken with some young Afghans who are trying to get out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=307.72s)]
*  I actually spoke with a young woman last week. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=310.76s)]
*  She was on a bus trying to get into the airport. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  She sat on that bus for about 10 hours. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=316.6s)]
*  The Taliban came on and were looking around, inspecting everybody. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=320.12s)]
*  It's tough because they have to get through the Taliban checkpoints. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=324.04s)]
*  And in order to do that, they have to identify themselves to the Taliban. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=327.64s)]
*  So if they don't make it into the airport, if they don't get out of the country, then [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  they have to return to Taliban-occupied Kabul, knowing that the Taliban has their names, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=335.44s)]
*  their contact details, all their information, knowing the Taliban knows that they've been [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=341.66s)]
*  trying desperately to leave the country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=345.94s)]
*  So it's unclear what's going to happen to them. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=348.7s)]
*  But these young people that I was speaking to, you know, they were actually willing to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=350.34s)]
*  give the Taliban the benefit of the doubt because right now, despite all of the stories [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=354.26s)]
*  that they've heard from their parents and their friends, their relatives who remember [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=358.14s)]
*  brutal Taliban rule back in the 1990s, so far, the Taliban hasn't shown itself to necessarily [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=362.48s)]
*  be quite the cruel taskmaster that they had back in the 90s. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=367.56s)]
*  And they're willing to entertain the idea that maybe they can either live under Taliban [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=372.44s)]
*  rule or that maybe they can go and get on a plane at a Taliban-controlled airport in [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=377.18s)]
*  Kabul and fly out after the U.S. has completely evacuated after that August 31st deadline. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=382.64s)]
*  If that's a possibility, maybe we've also heard some other things that maybe Turkey [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=389.86s)]
*  and Qatar might come together and create some kind of international institution that would [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=394.21999999999997s)]
*  then have governance over the airport, shared governance with the Taliban. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=399.86s)]
*  All of those discussions, unclear where they're going, whether or not that would be successful. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=404.56s)]
*  I mean, whether the Taliban would agree to allow third or fourth countries to take control [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=407.94s)]
*  or to have some stake in the management of the airport going forward. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=413.26s)]
*  There's a lot of plans that are out there right now, but it's hard to say. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=417.28s)]
*  It's hard to know exactly what's going to happen after that date, after tomorrow, August [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=420.28s)]
*  31st, that deadline. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  And hope as all many of them have. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  So now, after nearly 20 years in Afghanistan, less than 24 hours left there for American [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=427.92s)]
*  forces. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=433.76s)]
*  Matt Bradley in Landstuhl, Germany for us. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=434.76s)]
*  Matt, thanks so much. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=436.8s)]
*  President Biden and First Lady Biden honored the fallen during a dignified transfer yesterday [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=442.8s)]
*  The remains of the 13 American service members killed on Thursday in that attack at Kabul [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=445.46s)]
*  Airport, draped in American flags, were returned to Gold Star families. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=449.74s)]
*  11 Marines, a Navy medic, and an Army soldier. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=455.34s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News White House correspondent Mike Memley. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=459.66s)]
*  Mike, this is, of course, the most solemn duty a president can perform as commander-in-chief, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=462.5s)]
*  something that the president performed as vice president about five years ago. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=467.78s)]
*  Yeah, Willie, this is obviously a difficult set of days for the White House. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=472.76s)]
*  It's really hard to think of in recent memory in a four-year presidential term of convergence [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=476.64s)]
*  of crises, quite like what the Biden administration is facing now. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=482.24s)]
*  You started the show, of course, with that monster hurricane bearing down on one of the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=485.56s)]
*  most vulnerable stretches of coastline in the country. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=489.4s)]
*  You have the ongoing pandemic and millions of Americans set to return to school and to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=492.32s)]
*  work with a highly transmissible Delta variant. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=496.48s)]
*  It's still raging, but of course, the High Wire Act, walked by the White House in the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  next 24 hours ahead of this deadline, really came to life with this incredible scene at [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=504.82s)]
*  Dover Air Force Base yesterday, as the president met privately with some of those families [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=511.06s)]
*  of the lost heroes in Afghanistan and then participated for roughly an hour in the most [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=516.26s)]
*  solemn proceeding you could imagine. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=523.86s)]
*  No sound audible other than the commands being issued by the honor guards and as the press [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=527.36s)]
*  pool that was there for that moment yesterday described it, the anguished sobbing of some [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=534.24s)]
*  of the family members who participated. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=539.44s)]
*  Willie, we've talked so often about this president's relationship with grief, of course, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=541.96s)]
*  the grief he's experienced himself having lost two children, a wife in tragic circumstances, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=546.44s)]
*  the role he's played as Consular-in-Chief so often, sharing that empathy that he's built [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=553.74s)]
*  over the course of years himself. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=560.34s)]
*  This on display yesterday, but in a very different way, Willie. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=564.02s)]
*  This is really the first time he is doing this as a result of decisions he's made as [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=566.6600000000001s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=572.62s)]
*  And this is a burden. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=573.62s)]
*  White House officials are telling me he's feeling very significantly at this moment. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=575.4200000000001s)]
*  You could see him yesterday watching every one of those transfer cases from the moment [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=581.0s)]
*  they stepped off the plane to the moment they were put in those vehicles and really bowing [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=586.04s)]
*  his head in prayer each time. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=591.48s)]
*  You think of the moment just a few days ago when he spoke to the country and at one point [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=593.12s)]
*  after bowing his head for a moment of silence, he grasped what looked like a bracelet around [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=597.64s)]
*  his arm. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=603.84s)]
*  That was actually parts of the rosary that belonged to his son, Bo, of course, a member [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=604.84s)]
*  of the Delaware National Guard who served in Iraq. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=610.0s)]
*  The president obviously didn't lose his son in war, but he believes his son's cancer in [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=612.9200000000001s)]
*  part was a consequence of his time in war, the burn pits that he was near during his [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=618.72s)]
*  time there. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=623.64s)]
*  And so a very difficult day for the president over the course of a series of difficult days [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=624.64s)]
*  that very well could define his presidency, Willie. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=629.84s)]
*  Obviously, Mike, this decision, the way this evacuation has been handled over the last [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=631.8000000000001s)]
*  month has been criticized heavily. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=635.42s)]
*  It will be criticized probably for generations as people investigate it and they write books [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=637.8199999999999s)]
*  about it the way they did with Vietnam. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=642.06s)]
*  But in the here and now, how is this president thinking about Afghanistan when that last [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=644.76s)]
*  C-17 lifts off from Hamid Karzai Airport tomorrow and the American president ends there after [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=649.4599999999999s)]
*  nearly 20 years? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=655.3s)]
*  What does it look like now for this president in Afghanistan? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=657.48s)]
*  What if the Taliban? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=660.72s)]
*  What if ISIS? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=661.9s)]
*  What if Al Qaeda comes back? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=662.9s)]
*  What is the approach? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=664.8s)]
*  What is the policy? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=665.8s)]
*  Well, as White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki put this on Friday, this is not really a time [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=666.8s)]
*  at the White House for much self-reflection. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  There is considerable effort being made to make sure these final hours are safe ones [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=674.16s)]
*  where we don't see a repeat of the tragedy we saw last week. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=679.48s)]
*  The president directing his commanders to prioritize force protection at this moment. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=683.24s)]
*  He talked about the strike from a drone to neutralize an imminent threat. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=687.56s)]
*  The rockets that the president was briefed about overnight that were heading towards [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=692.12s)]
*  Hamid Karzai International Airport. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=696.1s)]
*  But it's been striking, Willie, as we've heard from the president several times over [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=698.34s)]
*  the course of the past week, at every moment he has expressed his sincere belief that the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=701.98s)]
*  decision he made is ultimately the right one for the country. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wal4PVE5nNU&t=708.64s)]
