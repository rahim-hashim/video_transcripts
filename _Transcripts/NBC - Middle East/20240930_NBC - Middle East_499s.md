# David Ignatius: Israel is going all the way against every enemy, to levels we've been fearing
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c)
*  Israel continues to hit targets in Lebanon days after the killing of the leader of Hezbollah. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel has the latest from Beirut. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=7.36s)]
*  Israel is widening its war in Lebanon and far beyond it, carrying out its deepest attack [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=14.56s)]
*  overnight in Lebanon's capital in nearly 20 years. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  This Israeli strike happened in the middle of the night. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=25.0s)]
*  For the first time, it is not in the southern suburb of Beirut, the Hezbollah stronghold [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=27.4s)]
*  in this city, but right in the heart of the commercial district. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  And that has many people in this city very nervous that now no area is off limits. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=37.6s)]
*  Israel is hunting Hezbollah across Beirut and targeting all of Iran's militias in the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=44.84s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=50.84s)]
*  Yesterday Israel carried out a major strike in Yemen. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=52.2s)]
*  The port city, now in flames, is under the control of a militia called the Houthis, backed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=56.4s)]
*  by Iran, and who've been targeting ships in the Red Sea. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=62.04s)]
*  But Lebanon remains the main focus of Israel's expanding war. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=66.56s)]
*  Israel said it wants to destroy Hezbollah, the crown jewel in Iran's so-called Axis of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=71.92s)]
*  Resistance. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=77.72s)]
*  New images show the massive crater left by the U.S.-made 2,000-pound bunker-busting [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=79.64s)]
*  bombs that Israel dropped to kill Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut last week. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=86.08s)]
*  And now Israel is hitting Hezbollah while it's down and in disarray, trying to eliminate [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=92.72s)]
*  every senior and mid-level commander it can find. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=98.82s)]
*  President Biden was asked Sunday if an all-out war can be prevented. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=103.28s)]
*  But many Lebanese have no faith the U.S. can or wants to stop this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=109.46s)]
*  This morning, we visited an office complex now full of families who have just fled South [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=114.38s)]
*  Beirut. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=119.78s)]
*  Isdhar Alfouani told me she thinks if Israel does invade, it will only make Hezbollah stronger, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=120.78s)]
*  because guerrilla war is the group's specialty. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=128.34s)]
*  Many here remain loyal to Hezbollah, cheering Nasrallah's name as they wait for his replacement [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=133.14s)]
*  to be announced. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=139.73999999999998s)]
*  Let's bring in White House reporter for The Washington Post, Yasmine Abutaleb. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=142.42s)]
*  And columnist and associate editor for The Washington Post, David Ignatius. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=146.72s)]
*  Good to have you both with us. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=151.17999999999998s)]
*  So, David, Israeli strikes in Yemen, Israeli strikes in Lebanon, Israeli strikes going [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=152.5s)]
*  after Iran's proxies, terrorist proxies across the Middle East. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=160.62s)]
*  It is almost as if Israel is daring Iran to push back. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=166.58s)]
*  And right now, does it not look like Iran is refusing to take the bait? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=175.22s)]
*  So Joe, Israel is going all the way against every enemy, taking the fight to levels that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=181.9s)]
*  we've been fearing for many months. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=189.46s)]
*  Obviously, Israel believes that Iran is worried enough about the consequences of getting involved [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=196.5s)]
*  directly, that it's going to mostly stay on the sidelines. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=203.46s)]
*  We'll have to see. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=208.06s)]
*  Predictions about the Middle East are notoriously wrong. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=209.06s)]
*  But that's sure the way it looks now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=211.74s)]
*  The destruction in Lebanon following the destruction of Gaza is painful to watch. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=215.14s)]
*  My strongest feeling is that this is a moment for the United States to help Lebanon regain [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  its sovereignty. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=227.17999999999998s)]
*  With this state within a state that's Hezbollah now really crumbling, it's a moment for the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  United States to provide radically more support for the Lebanese armed forces, to take back [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=234.82s)]
*  So they go to the border of Israel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=242.72s)]
*  They enforce discipline. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=245.76s)]
*  They make sure Hezbollah doesn't come back. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=247.8s)]
*  I feel this strongly because I've been watching Lebanon for 45 years, and this is a moment [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=249.72s)]
*  as bleak as it seems, when there actually could be that positive outcome if the administration [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=255.6s)]
*  will get serious about it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=261.72s)]
*  David, can you give us some insight on how Israel and how Israel intel services and the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=263.6s)]
*  IDF, who fared so horrifically on October the 7th, were humiliated in front of the world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=273.04s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu funding Hamas indirectly for years, telling Qatar to step up, waiting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=280.4s)]
*  12, 13 hours to rescue Israelis that were beaten, savaged, raped by Hamas. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  What has happened since October the 7th? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=298.76s)]
*  How has the IDF, how has the Mossad regained their footing in such a way to pull off what [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=301.76s)]
*  can only be called just an extraordinary attack against the leadership of Hezbollah? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=307.44s)]
*  So, Joe, I think in part it's the shame and real bitter self-criticism that the Mossad, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=314.24s)]
*  the Israeli military, all the leadership went through in the aftermath of October 7. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=324.64s)]
*  I talked to them in those weeks afterwards, and they were crushed and shattered. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=329.68s)]
*  They knew how their actions, their inaction, had betrayed Israel. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=334.72s)]
*  And they've been struggling to find ever since then a level of operating precision [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=339.12s)]
*  that can deliver knockout punches to their adversaries. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=345.76s)]
*  But it begins with a recognition of how poorly they performed in the lead up to October 7. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=350.16s)]
*  How did they do so badly then when they're obviously, in an operational sense, brilliant [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=357.88s)]
*  now? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=362.92s)]
*  That's a puzzle that historians will write about. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=363.92s)]
*  I want to read that book. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=366.24s)]
*  But I do know that for many Israeli intelligence officers, and indeed I suspect for the prime [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=367.92s)]
*  minister, these have been moments of vindication, justification. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=374.36s)]
*  We know we failed. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  This time we're succeeding. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=379.8s)]
*  Yasmine, let's dig into your reporting. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=381.44s)]
*  Your piece is entitled, in part, U.S. Braces for Potential Iranian Retaliation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=384.12s)]
*  What are the possibilities on that front? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=390.44s)]
*  So when I spoke with senior officials over the weekend, the different scenarios that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=393.72s)]
*  they were preparing for, and they cautioned that it was hard to predict exactly what would [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=398.32s)]
*  unfold over the next couple of days. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=403.04s)]
*  But they said they were preparing for potential Iranian attacks through their proxies on U.S. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=405.72s)]
*  troops, which we've seen in the region, which we've seen at various points over the last [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=411.04s)]
*  year. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=415.4s)]
*  They were preparing for direct Iranian missiles into Israel the way we saw on April 13. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=416.4s)]
*  The official I spoke with said before April 13, they would have been extremely worried [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=422.64s)]
*  about that type of scenario, but that after the April attack, when the U.S. and its allies [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=427.18s)]
*  in Israel were able to strike down the Iranian drones and missiles, that they feel reasonably [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=434.08s)]
*  prepared for that type of scenario. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=439.0s)]
*  And then the other one is just generally a direct attack from Hezbollah against Israel [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=441.44s)]
*  and attacks from proxies in the region. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=445.41999999999996s)]
*  So they anticipate that something is coming. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=447.62s)]
*  But again, they're not sure. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=451.64s)]
*  And I think the other important note here is that the U.S. has been, or at least has [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=455.52s)]
*  not known about what Israel was doing over the last two weeks against Hezbollah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  They didn't know ahead of time about the pager and handheld radio attack. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  They didn't know that they were going to launch a strike to take out Nasrallah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=469.58s)]
*  So I think they're also a bit unsure of what's coming next and that they are still cautioning [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=472.21999999999997s)]
*  Israel against a full-scale ground invasion of Lebanon. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=475.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqs1HS-SS3c&t=480.64s)]
