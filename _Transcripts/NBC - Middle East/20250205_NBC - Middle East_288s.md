# 'Craziest idea I've ever heard in my life': Chris Matthews floored by Trump's Gaza talk
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k)
*  Joining us now we have member of the New York Times editorial board Mara Gaye, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=0.0s)]
*  former MSNBC host and contributor to Washington Monthly, Chris Matthews. Chris, I'll start with [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  you. I'm curious how you're feeling right now about everything. Well, what you and John has [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=11.28s)]
*  been saying since early this morning, I think it's the craziest idea I've ever heard in my life. Two [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=20.0s)]
*  million people living in Gaza, a problem that Israel has and now we're going to have. We want [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=24.72s)]
*  to own Gaza. We want to take those two million people and somehow lure them to go to Jordan [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=30.72s)]
*  or to Egypt. Neither of those countries want them. Imagine Jordan, it's already overwhelmed with 60% [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  of its country are meds who come from the Palestinian areas. They don't need any more trouble. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  They don't need Hamas in their country. Hamas. Hamas is now going to move to Egypt and to Jordan [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=47.92s)]
*  and destroy those countries. Oh, by the way, it's also going to become a new hospitality center [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=53.36s)]
*  along the Mediterranean. I mean, give me a break. Hamas is not going to be good. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=59.68s)]
*  Wherever he goes, it's going to continue to be trouble wherever he goes and wherever he goes, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=64.72s)]
*  it's going to probably topple the government. And for the president to say, we won't use troops. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=70.24s)]
*  Of course we'll use. Imagine American service people's families realizing their son or daughter [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  has been sent to Gaza right in the middle of the Middle East fighting. We have avoided wars over [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=81.28s)]
*  there in 4856, 6773. Now we're getting right into the Israeli Arab war right in the middle of it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=86.88s)]
*  We're taking sides with Israel against the Arabs in Gaza and we're telling them to leave like [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=96.08s)]
*  they're an indigenous population in the United States back in the 19th century. Oh, we're going [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=101.44s)]
*  to move them out, move to some other place against their will. It's horrible. And it's going to be a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=106.0s)]
*  war. And I don't understand why he's doing this. I think it's the wackiest idea. So hard to say [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=112.24s)]
*  he's ever come up with. So one thought Senator Chris Murphy was talking earlier in our show is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=118.0s)]
*  that this is a distraction. I would meld what you're saying with what he's saying and saying, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=124.0s)]
*  this is amusing concept. He's come up with beach beachfront property, something well within his [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=130.32s)]
*  purview of interest and the way he would talk about something like that. That could have immediate [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=137.68s)]
*  consequences to the immediate situation, the ceasefire that's going on. But I also agree, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  it could be a distraction to what is going on right now in our government. And Chris, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=150.48s)]
*  I will follow up with you and then I want to hear from Maragay Lamar. You can take it to Mara. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=156.16s)]
*  About the folks who are being told they're immediately on leave as of Friday at USAID and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=161.28s)]
*  the FBI agents who investigated Gen six right now in the fight for their careers, some of them suing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=168.32s)]
*  Well, you know, the idea of getting rid of AID is awful. Our foreign aid programs like PEPFAR, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=175.6s)]
*  fighting AIDS in Africa, where I served for a couple of years, the Peace Corps is extraordinarily [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  popular. It's one of the good things we do in the world. The idea of bringing an Atlantic city [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=185.84s)]
*  to Gaza is crazy. By the way, go to Atlantic city, go to Trump tower, what's left of it down there, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=192.56s)]
*  go look at the gambling houses. Look what had happened the last time Trump tried to start a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=198.72s)]
*  Riviera, a new Riviera, a new Atlantic city. Take a look at the old Atlantic city and where that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=203.68s)]
*  ended up. It didn't work. It works in Vegas. It didn't work in Atlantic city. And now he wants [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=208.72s)]
*  to create this Mecca with Hamas becoming hospitality people as waiters and stuff like that and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=214.0s)]
*  chambermaids. Are you crazy? This is a crazy idea. I'm sorry to keep kidding, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=221.44s)]
*  but it is the craziest thing he's ever said. Bibi Netanyahu, who's got a sense of humor, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=225.76s)]
*  I suppose, he must have loved it because it said no more two state solution. Oh no, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=230.64s)]
*  we're going to have American allies as our neighbors and hotel keepers on the Gaza strip. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=235.68s)]
*  Unbelievable. And two million people are going to be coaxed away to destroy Jordan. What an idea [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=243.04s)]
*  for me. You know, the idea is definitely triggering and it's upsetting. And a lot of people responding [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  with shock and disbelief. And I think, you know, I think that it is a mistake to be shocked. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=256.56s)]
*  There's just a mistake to be shocked. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=265.84s)]
