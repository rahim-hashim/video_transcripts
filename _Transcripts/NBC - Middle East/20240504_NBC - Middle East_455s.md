# ‘Quality over quantity’: Biden deputy campaign manager says Biden will shorten his speeches
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8)
*  Tomorrow marks exactly six months until Election Day, and the split screen between President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden and Donald Trump, well, it keeps getting more striking. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=5.48s)]
*  Just yesterday, as President Biden honored 19 distinguished Americans with the Presidential [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=8.82s)]
*  Medal of Freedom, Donald Trump was, of course, back in that New York courtroom facing criminal [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=13.14s)]
*  charges for trying to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  The Biden campaign is now putting the split screen front and center. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=22.46s)]
*  We are out with a new ad blitz knocking Trump's attacks on reproductive rights. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=25.84s)]
*  Joining us now is Quinton Falks, Principal Deputy Campaign Manager of Biden-Harris 2024. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=30.08s)]
*  Quinton, I want to play one of those ads. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=35.16s)]
*  It is called Tough. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=38.72s)]
*  We'll talk about it on the other side. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=40.08s)]
*  I'm a Marine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=41.76s)]
*  I served in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  I know what tough is. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=47.84s)]
*  And a guy like Donald Trump that attacks women takes away their freedom and brags about it? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=49.32s)]
*  I'm glad to have done it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=55.32s)]
*  That's not tough. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  If he wants to take any more freedoms away from my three daughters, he'll have to come [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  through me first. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=62.28s)]
*  Me? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=63.28s)]
*  I'm with Joe Biden, because he'll give my daughters their freedom back. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=64.28s)]
*  Not lost on me, Quinton, that the narrator there is a Latino vet at a time when you know [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=69.52s)]
*  you got to be motivating Latino men. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=74.48s)]
*  Talk to me about the thinking behind that ad. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=77.92s)]
*  Look, I think that we're expanding the argument, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=80.8s)]
*  We are taking it and coming at it from a different angle. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=83.92s)]
*  Obviously, you all have seen some of the ads that we've done with testimonials from women [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  who are directly having the consequences of these national abortion bans that Donald Trump [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  has put into place and the overturn of Roe. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=95.16s)]
*  But this is a different angle. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=98.16s)]
*  And it shows the sort of willingness for fathers to stand up and fight for their daughters, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=100.16s)]
*  sons to stand up and fight for their mothers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=104.36s)]
*  When I was on this show last, I believe I talked about expanding these arguments and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=105.8s)]
*  making it broader and more real. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly what this ad does. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=110.8s)]
*  So as you're expanding the argument, we have new this morning from NBC News that the campaign [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  is looking to shorten its speeches. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  Biden's general election strategy is less is more. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  The president's aides are seeking to tighten his pitch to voters with shorter, crisperous [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=123.92s)]
*  speeches. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  To be honest with you, Quinton, I think that's a very smart idea. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=129.08s)]
*  I think for everyone, for everyone, for everyone. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=133.12s)]
*  And I really I appreciate that approach because it is a way for the president to sort of hit [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=136.88s)]
*  with clarity, stick his points and move on and not get lost and sidetracked. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=142.88s)]
*  Is give us a little bit more of the scene setting around the thinking there and trying [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=147.68s)]
*  to reimagine the campaign going forward with what you just said. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  And this idea now of the president tighten his his grip on his speeches. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=157.28s)]
*  Look, our campaign believes in quality over quantity. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=162.4s)]
*  We believe that these touches, these smaller things that are getting directly to the point [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=166.4s)]
*  about what is going on in the stakes of this election are going to be easier for voters [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=170.32s)]
*  to tap into and sort of also go out and say and talk to their friends and family about [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=175.0s)]
*  what's at stake. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=179.4s)]
*  And I think that those are some simple things that we can say. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=180.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is directly responsible for the fact that one in three women in this country of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  reproductive age are living under national abortion ban. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=187.24s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to destroy health care and rip away Social Security and Medicare. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=189.72s)]
*  We've got to remove the clutter. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=194.56s)]
*  Voters are tuning in and we've got to get directly to the point. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to be a dictator on day one and he's saying that he's proud and that most [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  people like that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=202.24s)]
*  We have to just remove all of the clutter and get it directly to the message to make it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=203.24s)]
*  easy for voters to follow, understand, go out and communicate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=206.72s)]
*  And that's what we're doing in our field offices around the country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=209.88s)]
*  And that's what we're going to continue to do with our principles as we send them out over [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=212.4s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=215.76s)]
*  Quinton, one of the things that's happening now is that Donald Trump is leaning into the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=217.0s)]
*  idea that the different protests that we're seeing across campuses is essentially going [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=220.88s)]
*  to be a problem child for the Biden campaign. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  Can you speak to that in terms of that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=231.36s)]
*  We know that the president has recently addressed the notion of peaceful protests and talked [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=233.24s)]
*  about that. But do you think that this is something that is going to gain traction, the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=238.28s)]
*  idea that somehow this could be an Achilles heel for the Biden campaign? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think if Donald Trump said that it's rich, considering that somebody who dropped out of a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=248.24s)]
*  primary is still getting about 200000 votes in a state that was decided by 78000 votes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  So you should focus on those problems. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=257.48s)]
*  But when it comes to this issue, I think it's important to call out that the president has [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=259.0s)]
*  said, as you said, that he believes in the right for peaceful protest, but that political [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=263.44s)]
*  violence, anti-Semitism is not going to be accepted. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=267.92s)]
*  The other piece here is that the president believes in what these protesters are saying and he [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=272.16s)]
*  is working to bring a peace to bring peace to the Middle East and bring this situation to a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=276.12s)]
*  close. And so we're going to continue to do that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=280.72s)]
*  We know that this issue is a very sensitive issue for a lot of people around the country, and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=282.6s)]
*  we're going to be respectful to that and believe and tell them that they have the right to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=286.68s)]
*  peacefully protest and that we respect their right to protest. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=291.04s)]
*  But this is an issue that we are going to continue to let play out. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=294.92s)]
*  The president is working diligently every day to bring it to a close, and we're going to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  continue to communicate with voters about issues and build out a campaign apparatus that is [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  drawing the stakes of this election and exactly what Donald Trump has done and the dangers [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  that he's posing to bring into a second term. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=309.24s)]
*  Quentin, I want to deal with, I think, a sticky part for this campaign. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=312.0s)]
*  And I'm curious as to how your team is looking at addressing it head on as soon as possible. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=318.0s)]
*  Trump is already setting up narratives about this upcoming election. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=324.12s)]
*  He's setting up narratives that if he does it, when it's rigged, he's setting up narratives, as [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=328.12s)]
*  we see in the courthouse, that says, you know, that, you know, they won't let him speak. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=332.36s)]
*  You know, the gag order is gagging his ability to testify, which again translates politically on [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  the street into this idea of the whole system being rigged against against Donald Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  How is the campaign prepared to make it clear to the American people? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=348.32s)]
*  A, we have the safest, most secure elections in the world. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  There is no rigging of elections. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  You have good people working on the ground and states across the country to make sure that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=357.76s)]
*  your vote is protected and that if Donald Trump loses, it's because Joe Biden legitimately beat him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=363.0s)]
*  Well, look, I think, first of all, I don't I don't agree with the idea that Americans actually [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=371.44s)]
*  believe what Donald Trump is saying on that front. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=375.56s)]
*  But when it comes to what we're doing from this campaign, we are building out a robust voter [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=377.72s)]
*  protection and access program to make sure that we are making sure that every voter that is [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  registered to vote across this country and goes out to vote in November is going to be able to do [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=387.12s)]
*  that safe, securely and free of misinformation and disinformation about their right to vote. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=391.0s)]
*  That's number one. The second piece is that we are going to continue to take the contrast directly [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=396.32s)]
*  to Trump. I think American voters can see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears where [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=400.92s)]
*  Donald Trump is spending his time and who Donald Trump is spending his time talking about and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=405.24s)]
*  defending. And it is not them as opposed to us when we are talking about the things that we are [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=408.6s)]
*  fighting for and what we believe in. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=413.4s)]
*  And so we have to get to that point first. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=415.16s)]
*  Right now, our campaign is in a posture of making sure that we are able to communicate the message [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=416.92s)]
*  in the contrast. November is a long way out and we've got a lot of work to do. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=421.36s)]
*  We're keeping our head down doing that and we'll deal with Election Day. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=424.72s)]
*  But make no mistake about it, this campaign will be in a position to defend voters across this [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=428.44s)]
*  country on Election Day and after if that's what it takes. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU10XqjVaF8&t=432.40000000000003s)]
