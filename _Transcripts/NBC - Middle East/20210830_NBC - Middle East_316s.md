# Fmr. Translator & Wife Killed In Attack As Marine Worked To Help Them Flee
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo)
*  U.S. veterans who served in Afghanistan have been working around the clock for weeks now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=0.0s)]
*  to get their former translators and other Afghan colleagues out. One of them is former Marine Captain [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=3.84s)]
*  Andrew Darlington, who was desperately trying to evacuate his translator, Obaid, and his family to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=9.36s)]
*  the airport for flight on Thursday. Darlington was texting with him, trying to get them through the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  crowd at the Abbey Gate, where one of his active-duty Marine buddies was standing by, ready to pull them [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=20.32s)]
*  through the gate. Darlington texting, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=25.52s)]
*  Get to Abbey Gate now. I have U.S. Marines ready for you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=28.32s)]
*  Abaid sending back a picture and Darlington writing, Stay there. Do you see the Marine? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=31.92s)]
*  But before they could reach his friend, the bomb went off. Obaid and his wife were killed. His two [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=37.2s)]
*  young sons were further back with a relative. They survived. Darlington's Marine friend was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=43.44s)]
*  injured but was later safely evacuated and over the weekend arrived at Walter Reed for treatment. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=48.56s)]
*  Joining me now is Andrew Darlington, former Marine Captain who served in Afghanistan [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=54.24s)]
*  as a Purple Heart recipient. Andrew, this is heartbreaking, obviously. I don't know how to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=58.56s)]
*  convey our condolences, but tell us about his family, your relationship to them, and how the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=65.92s)]
*  boys are doing. Sure. Thanks for having me. I first met Obaid in 2012. I was deployed with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment. At the time, Obaid was not, in fact, my interpreter. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=80.56s)]
*  I just got to know him. Truthfully, interpreters had the best food on our cops, so I hung out with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=87.04s)]
*  them a lot. I got to know him and I did get to observe him working with Marines and our Afghan [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=94.16s)]
*  Army partners. Obaid was always very motivated, very happy to serve in whatever capacity. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=102.08s)]
*  He was constantly going on patrol, sitting in on Shura's assisting Marines to the fullest of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=109.28s)]
*  his abilities, working day and night, going on operations when we would insert into enemy [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=115.68s)]
*  strongholds and try to disrupt enemy networks or go after enemy targets or narcotics. All in all, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=121.36s)]
*  he was just a phenomenal asset for our unit. I kept in touch with him. I did deploy again in 2014. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=128.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to work with Obaid. I did remain in touch with him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=136.08s)]
*  And then fast forward through the last six, seven years, I've kept in touch with my buddy. He had [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=140.72s)]
*  since gotten married and had two kids. I was able to see pictures of every life event. I kind of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  talked to him virtually along the way. Sometime around 2015 is when we started the SIV process. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=154.56s)]
*  We were unsuccessful there and then fast forward to the last few weeks where [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=161.04s)]
*  myself and three other Marines were doing everything we could to get our friend out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=166.32s)]
*  And I mean, you said you started the SIV process with them. So they were part of that backlog we've [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  all been talking about. This puts a human face on it. This family, they were at the gate. They were [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  at the gate. They were maybe yards away from where they could have gotten through with the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  help of your buddy and gotten on a plane. Correct. And just to clarify, he wasn't just part of the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=191.44s)]
*  backlog. He was denied. He was denied in part due to quote, lack of valuable and faithful service. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=199.52s)]
*  As well, he was denied in part because of derogatory information. I wrote letters, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=206.72s)]
*  emails, I called friends to see if we could get in touch with the embassy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=212.4s)]
*  All I wanted to know was what they were basing their decisions on. I wholeheartedly disagree [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=216.16s)]
*  with both assertions, but I never found the proper answers. All I got were summaries of the events [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=220.8s)]
*  I already knew. We filed an appeal. We were unsuccessful. And since that time, we've been [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=226.0s)]
*  scrambling to get him out. Fast forward to, again, the past week. And you said it best. At this point, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=231.76s)]
*  I was just relying on a Naval Academy classmate, a friend of mine, to help me out in this last [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=239.76s)]
*  ditch effort. We got to the five yard line and we were unsuccessful. What's going to happen to the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=245.2s)]
*  children? All I can say is right now, we're doing everything we can to keep them safe. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  And what about your buddy, your Marine who was evacuated, medevaced? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=261.84s)]
*  He's doing well. I talked to him again yesterday. He's doing just fine. He's at this point in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=266.56s)]
*  recovery from surgery. He's going to be all right. He's being well taken care of. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=276.32s)]
*  Well, Andrew Darlington, you know, your valiant efforts and I can't imagine the emotions that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=281.6s)]
*  are surrounding all of this. Thank you very much for sharing your story today. It's just [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=287.52s)]
*  one illustration, one story of so many thousands. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Bf-WjdWSo&t=292.8s)]
