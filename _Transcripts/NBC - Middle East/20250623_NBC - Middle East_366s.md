# ‘Not a surprising moment’: Rep. Himes reacts to missiles launched at U.S. military bases
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk)
*  I want to bring in Democratic Congressman of Connecticut, Jim Himes. He is the ranking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=0.0s)]
*  member of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, we are very early into this, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=4.32s)]
*  but I want to get your reaction to what we're seeing and the reports we're getting out of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=10.52s)]
*  Iran. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=14.16s)]
*  Well, not a surprising moment, you know, when we all learned in the Congress of this attack. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=15.16s)]
*  And by the way, I would argue that the Congress should have learned of it before the attack. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=23.88s)]
*  The Constitution is very clear, as is the law on the necessity, particularly when the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=27.58s)]
*  stakes are as high as they are in this situation with 40,000 servicemen within range of Iranian [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=32.06s)]
*  weaponry, that the Congress should, according to the law, be consulted on this sort of thing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=37.66s)]
*  But now, of course, we are in this snowball that is going downhill that nobody really [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=42.12s)]
*  controls. Now, I completely agree with your military expert. Hopefully this is performative. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=46.459999999999994s)]
*  Hopefully this is the Iranian regime saying, you know, we can't afford to let the attack [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=51.7s)]
*  on our nuclear facilities go unanswered. It will be performative that we'll say, look, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=56.26s)]
*  we can reach these people and then maybe we can get back to trying to de-escalate a very, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=60.18s)]
*  very dangerous situation. But again, it's too early to say. Our bases there, both in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=64.7s)]
*  Adal-ud-Dade and Bahrain and our other, you know, they're well defended. But they, you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=69.62s)]
*  know, were the Iranians to decide to cut loose with all of their short-range missiles with [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=74.9s)]
*  an overwhelming number of drones. We could very, very easily wind up with damage to American [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=79.06s)]
*  assets or even American casualties, which will, you know, once again remind us why war [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=83.98s)]
*  in the Middle East should always be a last resort. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=89.02s)]
*  Well, I mean, we talked about earlier, Congressman, the response after the assassination of Soleimani [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=91.14s)]
*  and the price that was paid by American service members. But I want to go back to what you [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=97.9s)]
*  said about being informed. And I wonder what intelligence tells you or if there have been [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=102.22s)]
*  briefings, if you feel confident of the status of the Iranian military capabilities right [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=110.22s)]
*  now, which may indeed inform whether or not this is more performative than widely dangerous. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=116.22s)]
*  Well, let's divide that question into two things. The objective of the strikes that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=123.22s)]
*  the president took some 36 hours ago, of course, was to remove the Iranian nuclear capability. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=128.78s)]
*  And we have no idea whether that was achieved. Thank God, tactically speaking, it was a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=135.18s)]
*  successful raid inasmuch as the planes and the naval assets delivered the ordinance. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=138.94s)]
*  But we have no idea as of yet whether the uranium was even in one of the three facilities. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=143.54s)]
*  This was an attack that was broadcast many, many days in advance of it occurring. So, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=148.3s)]
*  and obviously the Iranians are not dumb people, right? There is, of course, a possibility [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=153.66s)]
*  that the Iranians were able to move the highly enriched uranium, in which case we undertook [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=157.38s)]
*  a dangerous operation without any obvious payback for having done so. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=161.18s)]
*  So anyway, it will be a good long time before we know, if we ever learn, whether we were [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=168.74s)]
*  able to actually destroy the stocks of 60% enriched uranium. Now, what we know about [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=172.82s)]
*  their conventional response, what they have the ability, they have a lot of missiles. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=177.38s)]
*  The Israelis took out a lot of their launchers, so they've got a real problem. They do have [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=181.5s)]
*  a lot of missiles. They do have a lot of drones. They could cause a lot of damage. On the flip [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=185.58s)]
*  side, of course, the Israelis made fairly short work of a lot of their capabilities. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=189.34s)]
*  And it's hard to believe that there isn't a great deal of chaos in the upper ranks [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=194.66s)]
*  of the Iranian military leadership. These are people who probably are fearing as much [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=199.5s)]
*  for their own survival as they are thinking about the strategy of a counter-strike. So, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=203.34s)]
*  again, far, far more unknowns in this moment than there is any ability to make a conclusion [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=208.26s)]
*  about exactly where we are. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=215.06s)]
*  We've been showing some video, I don't know that you can see it, Congressman, but it is [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=216.82s)]
*  showing a video that is the airstrikes, we believe, that rained down on Doha, Qatar. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=220.42s)]
*  Qatar is saying right now, at least, that there have been no casualties. But this is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=226.14s)]
*  the world, as the U.S. Congress is returning, first opportunity for many of you to be together, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  to have a conversation, to recognize that the president and his national security staff, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=238.61999999999998s)]
*  even as we speak, are in the situation room. What is the role of Congress right now, and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=243.5s)]
*  what is your reasonable expectation of what action Congress will take? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=248.26s)]
*  Well, you know, though it is water under the bridge at this point, I can't not make the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=253.82s)]
*  case for the absolute imperative for any president, Democrat or Republican, to come to the Congress [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=259.86s)]
*  as stipulated by the Constitution of the United States, to which we all swear an oath, stipulated [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=265.5s)]
*  in the War Powers Act that unless the United States is under attack or there is a declaration [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=271.18s)]
*  of war, the president must allow the Congress to debate and consider this kind of action. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=276.58s)]
*  Now, again, I think we're all praying that this de-escalates rather than escalating, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=283.1s)]
*  that we don't see a massive pop in fuel prices, that we don't see the destabilization of regimes [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=288.66s)]
*  like Jordan or others in the region, that we don't see the deaths of American servicemen. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=294.1s)]
*  But all of those stakes are precisely why we are supposed to consider and ultimately [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=299.78s)]
*  approve this sort of action. Now, you asked what happens going forward. The president [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=304.56s)]
*  is obligated under the law within 48 hours to inform the Congress what his intentions [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=309.72s)]
*  are and what he believes he's looking to achieve. And I would hope that we would engage in the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=314.76s)]
*  kinds of debates that the Constitution says we should. Now, I would hope, but you know, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=320.52s)]
*  the reality is you need to watch this place for about 10 seconds to know that the Republican [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=324.92s)]
*  majorities in the House and the Republican majorities in the Senate will very gladly [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  tear the Constitution up if that's simply what Donald Trump wants. So I suspect that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=332.32s)]
*  that's where we're going to be in the next week or so. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=337.12s)]
*  Well, Congressman, thank you so much for taking the time. I know you have a lot going on and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=339.12s)]
*  we appreciate you coming on the program. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=344.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOaMCqyYqk&t=362.32s)]
