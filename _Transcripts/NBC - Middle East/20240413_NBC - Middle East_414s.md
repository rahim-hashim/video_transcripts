# Iran attack expected to include ballistic missiles targeting Israeli government sites
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw)
*  I want to bring in Courtney Qubey now to talk more about this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=0.0s)]
*  But I also want to play some tape that we're getting in of the president making his way [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=4.48s)]
*  towards the Oval Office Corp, because we know the president obviously cut his weekend short [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=8.92s)]
*  in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, to come back to the White House to meet with his national [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=13.84s)]
*  security team in light of the events that are developing in the Middle East, images [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=18.56s)]
*  there of the president making his way towards the Oval Office for that sit-down. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=22.14s)]
*  Of course, the more information we get out of the White House, we will bring it to you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Courtney, bring us up to date. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=29.92s)]
*  What are you learning from your sources? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=31.16s)]
*  So, I mean, in a word that, you know, in a couple words, this is begun. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=33.2s)]
*  This is the Iranian retaliation that we've been expecting and waiting for for more than [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=38.28s)]
*  10 days now, Yaz. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=42.2s)]
*  And it's really ratcheted up over the last 24 hours or so, the expectation that it would [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=43.86s)]
*  occur this weekend. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=47.24s)]
*  And it's really beginning the way that U.S. officials have been telling us they were expecting. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=49.08s)]
*  And that is in a number of drones, a potential drone swarm making its way towards targets [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=53.160000000000004s)]
*  in Israel. The expectation is this attack or this military operation by Iran will also [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=59.48s)]
*  likely include dozens of land attack cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=66.36s)]
*  But we have not seen that yet. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=71.72s)]
*  But keep in mind, Yaz, when you're talking about a drone flying from somewhere in Iran [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=73.52s)]
*  towards somewhere in Israel, that's going to take longer than a ballistic missile would. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=77.64s)]
*  So just given the tyranny of distance here, it would make sense that the drones would [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=82.32s)]
*  launch off first and they will take some time to make their way all the way to Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=86.72s)]
*  Now, as far as targets go, they are the targets that we've been talking about now for the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=90.52s)]
*  past several days seem to be where U.S. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=94.48s)]
*  officials still believe this is going. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=96.48s)]
*  So that is Israeli government sites, so potentially military or intelligence sites as opposed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=98.0s)]
*  to sites that would target Israeli citizens or civilians or even religious sites inside [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=105.12s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=111.32s)]
*  We are also told that Iran is still expected to be carrying out, while it is a major military [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  operation, they are expected to be targeting things that they would consider to be somewhat [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=119.68s)]
*  proportional to the strike in Damascus. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=125.64s)]
*  Now, you'll recall that the building that the Israeli military struck on April 1st in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=128.6s)]
*  Damascus was on a consular site. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=134.36s)]
*  It's really in dispute exactly what the building was being used for. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=137.96s)]
*  But there is no doubt that it was on a consular compound. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=141.36s)]
*  And so thereby was in some ways had some sort of a diplomatic overall feeling or even, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=145.36s)]
*  frankly, protection from what we would normally see. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=153.52s)]
*  That's where the proportionality of this comes in. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  According to U.S. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  officials, they believe that that is why Iran is likely to target Israeli government sites [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=159.4s)]
*  here. Now, critically, according to U.S. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=164.56s)]
*  officials, they still do not expect these strikes to go after U.S. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  sites in the region. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=171.92s)]
*  But keep in mind, the U.S. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=173.72s)]
*  has a lot in that area and there's always the possibility for some drone or missile to go [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  awry, to go off course and for there to be some sort of, frankly, a mistake here that could [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=181.88s)]
*  potentially lead to some catastrophic outcomes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, the U.S. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=190.48s)]
*  military already has a massive presence in the region in the last several days. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=191.04s)]
*  The Pentagon has repositioned some of those things, specifically a number of U.S. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=196.64s)]
*  ships, including the USS Carney. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=201.0s)]
*  That may sound familiar to you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=202.88s)]
*  We've been talking about the Carney for months now because it's been down in the Red Sea and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=204.32s)]
*  throughout that region defending against attacks by the Houthis. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=208.28s)]
*  That's projectiles like drones and missiles similar to what we may be seeing here tonight [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=211.96s)]
*  launched out of Iran. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=216.72s)]
*  The Carney has been shooting those down for a number of months while they were, frankly, on their [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=218.04s)]
*  way back home. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  They were up in the Med heading back towards the U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=223.76s)]
*  Now they're being held there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  They're going to stay in the region to potentially help protect Israel against some of these. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=228.72s)]
*  In addition to the Carney, though, there are other U.S. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  assets that, again, have been repositioned in the area. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=235.16s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  military says they are ready to help defend against this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=238.16s)]
*  But at this point, it's really just a waiting game. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=241.6s)]
*  Officials are still saying they expect this to unfold over a matter of hours. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=243.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=247.16s)]
*  Courtney, are the U.S. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=249.4s)]
*  officials that you've been speaking to seeing the drone attack, the initial drone attack as [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=250.92s)]
*  more kind of a warning shot for Israel to get prepared for what else is coming behind it? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=255.56s)]
*  So no one's describing it that way. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=262.08s)]
*  But I think that it just by nature of the fact that it takes so long for those drones to get [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=264.56s)]
*  from wherever they're launching, presumably in Iran, all the way to presumably somewhere in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=269.56s)]
*  Israel, just the fact that it's going to take hours for them to get there gives Israel that heads [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  up. You remember, there has been a tremendous amount of diplomatic backchanneling ever since [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=279.36s)]
*  that strike in Damascus. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=285.08s)]
*  Officials, countries all in that region, all throughout Europe and all the way to the U.S. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=287.76s)]
*  have been urging both sides to try to deescalate. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  But the reality is here, Iran has been signaling that they were going to carry out some sort of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=296.8s)]
*  retaliatory action. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=301.84s)]
*  And a lot of officials believe that they have to. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=303.44s)]
*  They have to do something here to fight back against what was a significant strike in Damascus. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, we don't forget it wasn't just the fact that that strike hit on a consular compound that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  belonged to Iran in Damascus. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=317.96s)]
*  It also took out a very senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Quds Force General and a number of other [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  senior Iranian officials. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=326.88s)]
*  It was a serious strike and it doesn't, the officials who we've spoken to believe that there's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=328.36s)]
*  almost no way that Iran can't respond. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  It's just a matter of exactly how serious the response here is. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=341.04s)]
*  How are they characterizing the seizing Courtney of the ship this morning, the MSC Ares? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=342.68s)]
*  Is that at all connected to what's happening now? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  Are they seeing any connection there? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=350.08s)]
*  At this point, that is not expected to be. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=351.68s)]
*  No one believes that this is part of this overall operation. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=356.36s)]
*  You remember, this isn't the first time we've seen this sort of Iranian activity in the in the region, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  even in recent months. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=364.04s)]
*  So it may just be a very strange coincidence. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=365.64s)]
*  But so far, as of now, officials in the U.S. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  government are saying they don't see this as part of this overall operation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EWzI0Xvcw&t=371.88s)]
