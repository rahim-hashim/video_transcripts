# 'Iran has been put into a corner': Engel on what happens after U.S. bombs Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ)
*  And joining me now is NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It's still in the early hours of the morning there. Obviously, the big question today on [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=4.72s)]
*  everyone's mind, the president is calling it a spectacular success. The immediate question on [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=8.4s)]
*  everyone's mind is, A, how severe is the damage? Will it set Iran's nuclear program definitively [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=12.48s)]
*  back? And B, where does Iran go from here, if you can shed light on what Israel is bracing itself for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=19.76s)]
*  today? So the Israelis on a very short term basis are concerned about a reprisal. The Home [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=25.68s)]
*  Front Command, which issues guidance and doesn't change its guidance that often, it has been giving [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=34.24s)]
*  a guidance here to remain vigilant up until now, has upped its level of alert telling people that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  they should not attend any public gatherings, no sporting events, no school, no work gatherings, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=47.6s)]
*  only essential work. So they are on a heightened state of alert, semi-lockdown, if you will. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=54.72s)]
*  Again, they had already been under attack with Iranian ballistic missiles coming down [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=63.44s)]
*  at Israel every single day for the last week or so. So this country was already on high alert, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=68.64s)]
*  they're bracing for some sort of response. But the Israeli reaction, official reaction, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  has been absolutely to welcome this. You have Prime Minister Netanyahu echoing President [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=78.0s)]
*  Trump's statements. They are clearly working hand in glove. This is something that Israel has long [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=82.32s)]
*  wanted. On the street, right now the streets are quite quiet, but on the street when we talk to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=86.8s)]
*  people, they are generally supportive of this military operation. It was seen as a better now [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=92.0s)]
*  than later philosophy that they were going to engage with Iran at some stage, that it was better [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=97.44s)]
*  to do it now before having a nuclear weapon. That's the view as it was seen from here. But there are [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  countries in the region who might not be vocally expressing their concerns, who I'm hearing from [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=111.04s)]
*  privately, who are very worried that Israel and the United States now seem to have a feeling of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=117.84s)]
*  unchecked power and that they don't know where this is going. That this was Prime Minister [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=123.2s)]
*  Netanyahu's goal, that he found President Trump relatively easily manipulated, and that he was [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=127.44s)]
*  going to do this and finally got the United States on board. And of course, though, the window now [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=134.24s)]
*  opens itself to a possible Iranian retaliation. If you hear what the president said today or see [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=139.76s)]
*  what he said today in the social post that he, the social media post, he suggested that any [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=144.56s)]
*  Italian Iranian retaliation would be met with a greater force. Some see this right now as an [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  opening that if Iran does retaliate against America, certainly in the region, it would open [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=154.72s)]
*  the door for even more American involvement, potentially leading ultimately to regime change, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=160.56s)]
*  something that the Israeli prime minister has agitated for, has certainly called for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=165.28s)]
*  in the past. One senior official I've spoken to from the region said this could be the beginning [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=170.56s)]
*  of the end for the Islamic regime in Iran, depending on what they do next. Where do you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=175.04s)]
*  see this going from a kind of big picture approach, not just in the short term? I mean, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  Iran is now cornered. If they do retaliate, they run the risk of going into a direct war with the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=185.36s)]
*  United States, which wouldn't be very last for them, very long for them. They wouldn't last very [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=190.88s)]
*  long. Or if they do nothing, they appear very weakened in the eyes of their own people and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=195.04s)]
*  ultimately susceptible to its collapse. No doubt Iran has been put into a corner. They were engaged [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=200.24s)]
*  in negotiations. President Trump is framing this as we're using force in order to convince the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=210.48s)]
*  Iranians to come back to the negotiating table, to think again. They thought they could keep their [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=215.44s)]
*  nuclear enrichment program. Well, now they don't have a nuclear enrichment program, so they better [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=220.4s)]
*  come back to the table now. But the Iranians believe that the negotiating table was all a trick, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=224.32s)]
*  that they were lured into this process under false pretenses, that then Yahoo and Trump were always [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=229.36s)]
*  going to do this, that President Trump just recently said that they have two more weeks to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=236.24s)]
*  negotiate and barely a day went by before the bomb started dropping on those nuclear sites today. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=240.72s)]
*  So Iran, there's no trust. There never had been trust. But Iran feels, and I was just in Iran, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=247.52s)]
*  and officials there have been saying this publicly, that they believe that this process was only [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=253.68s)]
*  designed to get them to put their guard down and allow them to be attacked. Now, can they go back [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=259.44s)]
*  to negotiations? The ones they believe are fictitious and set up to make them fail? What [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=266.72s)]
*  choice do they have? Because if they engage directly with the U.S. military even more so, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=274.24s)]
*  then they could face a total annihilation of their military capacity, including their capacity to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=280.48s)]
*  maintain control over law and order at home. There have been some attacks on Iranian police stations. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=287.2s)]
*  The internet is out in Iran right now because the government is so afraid of infiltration, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  that there are Israeli spies, so they're trying to limit communications. The Iranian government [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  is in a very fragile state right now, and when you have cornered a state, and Iran is cornered, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=304.24s)]
*  that is, President Trump is hoping that is what makes them more malleable, but it also could make [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=310.24s)]
*  them much more dangerous. You know, I know that you had spoken to Ali Shamkhani, the top Iranian [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  negotiator, a couple weeks ago, certainly before the Israeli war began on Iran. He was rumored to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=322.08s)]
*  have been dead. He certainly turned out to be alive according to Iranian state media, but since [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  you are one of the last Western journalists to have spoken to him, do you get a sense now that, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, with Iran cornered, it may have to negotiate if it wants to keep the regime in place, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  if it wants the regime to survive, that's what they're going to be negotiating about while you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=346.64s)]
*  have Israel perhaps wanting to continue this operation to decapitate the regime once and for all? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=350.8s)]
*  Well, I think that's exactly what you're talking about, what's on the table here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=358.88s)]
*  Before they were negotiating about their nuclear program, they were negotiating whether they would [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=363.04s)]
*  continue to have the right to enrich uranium at some capacity, and I did speak with Ali Shamkhani, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=367.52s)]
*  who is one of the top advisors, military, nuclear, and political advisor to the supreme leader, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=374.56s)]
*  the Ayatollah al-Aqamani of Iran, one of the key people in the country who is authorized to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=381.2s)]
*  speak definitively about what Iran would and would not accept in negotiations. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=387.6s)]
*  And he laid out what Iran's expectations are. He said they wanted to keep enriching uranium to a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=392.24s)]
*  low level, that they would be willing to get rid of their more highly enriched uranium, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=398.56s)]
*  those sites that were attacked today. Iran said they were going to get rid of it anyway in an [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=404.0s)]
*  agreement, that they were willing to do that. Russia had proposed to potentially be a mediator [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=409.84s)]
*  in that process. They wanted a lifting of sanctions, and they also promised to allow in [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=414.72s)]
*  inspectors to oversee the entire process. And President Trump responded to that comment from [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=421.04s)]
*  Shamkhani and said, it looks like we're close to a deal. So for a while, it looked like the two [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=426.56s)]
*  sides were very close to a deal, but then suddenly the goalposts got further, and suddenly Iran was [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=430.72s)]
*  not cooperating, and suddenly it was close to a nuclear weapon, and suddenly it was very close, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=438.16s)]
*  and suddenly the U.S. intelligence assessment under Tulsi Gabbard changed, and the Iranians [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  believed that they were duped into all of this. So now they are not negotiating. If they do go back [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=450.08s)]
*  to negotiations, I think they have no choice. They're not negotiating about their nuclear program. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=455.6s)]
*  They're now negotiating about the regime's survival. All right. With me now, Richard Engel, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  thank you so much for that. Greatly appreciated. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=464.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpVuEA72KQ&t=485.6s)]
