# 'She’s wrong': Trump undercuts his OWN intel chief I Full Briefing
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4)
*  So we just learned that Rwanda — you know, all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=0.0s)]
*  about Rwanda — and the Congo will be doing a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  peace settlement, probably coming in — on Monday or [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=10.14s)]
*  Tuesday, we're going to be signing it up. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=14.42s)]
*  And we've stopped a very vicious war. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=16.84s)]
*  So that was an honor for me to be involved. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=19.38s)]
*  I want to thank JD Vanson for a great job, and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=21.52s)]
*  also our Secretary of State Marco Rubio has done a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=26.4s)]
*  fantastic job. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=30.5s)]
*  So Rwanda — a long-term war with the Congo, a very [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=32.36s)]
*  bloody war — they're all bloody, but this was a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=35.46s)]
*  really bloody one — is going to be making peace [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=37.64s)]
*  with Congo, and they can get on to making trade [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=40.7s)]
*  deals with the United States and other places, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  and have a much more normal form of life. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=46.94s)]
*  We're very honored by that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=49.82s)]
*  As you know, we did a very great job with India and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Pakistan, and we had India in. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=55.28s)]
*  It looks like we're going to be making a trade deal [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=58.42s)]
*  with India. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=60.22s)]
*  And we had Pakistan in. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=61.46s)]
*  It looks like we're going to be making a trade deal [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=62.96s)]
*  with Pakistan. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=64.7s)]
*  And it's a beautiful thing to watch. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=66.4s)]
*  Serbia, Kosovo, likewise — they've been fighting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=68.6s)]
*  for years. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=71.14s)]
*  And as you know, we brought that one to a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=71.8s)]
*  conclusion. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=73.64s)]
*  And now we have a couple of big ones. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=74.94s)]
*  We have Russia-Ukraine, which is making a little [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=78.28s)]
*  bit of progress. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=80.62s)]
*  And we have Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=82.3s)]
*  And nobody really knows what that one is all about. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=83.94s)]
*  We're going to find out pretty soon, I guess. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=87.18s)]
*  The Press. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=89.54s)]
*  The Iranian Foreign — Mr. President, the Iranian [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=90.54s)]
*  Foreign Minister this afternoon said, if the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=91.54s)]
*  U.S. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=93.84s)]
*  is serious about negotiations, that you [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=94.68s)]
*  would call up Israel and request that they stop [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=96.78s)]
*  their airstrikes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=99.38s)]
*  Will you make that request? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=100.42s)]
*  Well, I think it's very hard to make that request [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=101.92s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  If somebody is winning, it's a little bit harder to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=104.62s)]
*  do than if somebody is losing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=107.2s)]
*  But we're ready, willing, and able. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=109.7s)]
*  And we've been speaking to Iran, and we'll see what [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=111.44s)]
*  happens. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=114.22s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=114.88s)]
*  The Press. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=115.58s)]
*  What was the thought process behind two weeks [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=116.22s)]
*  time table? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=118.48s)]
*  Just time to see whether or not people come to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=119.16s)]
*  their senses. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=123.12s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=123.8s)]
*  The Press. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=124.46s)]
*  Mr. President, did the Europeans help at all in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=125.12s)]
*  talking with Iranians? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=127.2s)]
*  No, they didn't help. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=128.2s)]
*  No. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=129.26s)]
*  Iran doesn't want to speak to Europe. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=129.94s)]
*  They want to speak to us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=132.14s)]
*  Europe is not going to be able to help in this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=134.34s)]
*  Twenty years ago, you were skeptical of a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  Republican administration that attacked the Middle [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=138.38s)]
*  East country on the idea of questionable intelligence [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=141.14000000000001s)]
*  of weapons of mass destruction. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=143.94s)]
*  How is this moment different with Iran? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=145.68s)]
*  Well, there were no weapons of mass destruction. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=147.58s)]
*  I never thought there were. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  And that was somewhat pre-nuclear. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=151.74s)]
*  You know, it was a nuclear age, but nothing like it [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=153.88s)]
*  is today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=156.82s)]
*  And it looked like I'm right about the material [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=158.28s)]
*  that they've gathered already. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=161.9s)]
*  It's a tremendous amount of material. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=163.32s)]
*  And I think within a matter of weeks, or certainly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  within a matter of months, they're going to be able [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=167.94s)]
*  to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=170.17999999999998s)]
*  We can't let that happen. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=171.16s)]
*  I was very much opposed to Iraq. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=172.82s)]
*  I was I said it loud and clear, but I was a [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=175.6s)]
*  civilian. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  But I guess I got a lot of publicity. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=178.44s)]
*  But I was very much opposed to the Iraq war. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  And I actually did say, don't go in, don't go in, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  don't go in. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  But I said, if you're going to go in, keep the oil. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=187.5s)]
*  But they didn't do that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=190.64s)]
*  What intelligence do you have that Iran is building [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=191.5s)]
*  a nuclear weapon? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=193.48s)]
*  Your intelligence community has said they have no [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  evidence that they are at this point. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, then my intelligence community is wrong. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=198.0s)]
*  Who in the intelligence community said that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  Your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=202.84s)]
*  She's wrong. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=205.64s)]
*  They're right there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  The Press. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=207.0s)]
*  They say that they're there to take people out. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  But I can't tell you about that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=218.6s)]
*  I get along very well with China. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=221.0s)]
*  Get along very well with President Xi. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=223.14s)]
*  I like him. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=225.0s)]
*  He likes me. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=225.66s)]
*  We have a very good relationship. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=227.1s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=228.7s)]
*  I can't imagine them getting involved. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=229.76s)]
*  The Press. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=231.6s)]
*  The decision that you need to make on Iran, whether [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=232.3s)]
*  to strike militarily, is this the biggest decision [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=234.0s)]
*  you'll have to make as President? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=236.8s)]
*  Well, I can't tell you that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=239.94s)]
*  I have to see what happens. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=240.98s)]
*  I can't, you know, really say that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=242.34s)]
*  It depends what the decision is. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=244.72s)]
*  But I wouldn't really be able to tell you that now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=247.04s)]
*  I'll tell you in about a year from now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=249.12s)]
*  Maybe five years or 10 years from now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=251.18s)]
*  You never know about decisions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=253.82s)]
*  You never really know. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=255.5s)]
*  The Press. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=256.5s)]
*  Sir, would you support a ceasefire while the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=257.04s)]
*  negotiations happen with Iran? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=258.7s)]
*  The President. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=260.38s)]
*  I might, depending on the circumstances. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=260.98s)]
*  Would you? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=262.38s)]
*  The former congressman backgated. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  It's very hard to stop. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=264.22s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=265.42s)]
*  It's very hard to stop. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=266.92s)]
*  When you look at it, Israel is doing well in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=268.18s)]
*  terms of war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=271.56s)]
*  And I think you would say that Iran is doing less well. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=273.36s)]
*  It's a little bit hard to get somebody to stop. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=276.86s)]

*  They don't wear uniforms. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=550.0600000000001s)]
*  But we have murderers that came out of the last [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=551.7s)]
*  four years. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=553.94s)]
*  We have murderers. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=554.6s)]
*  We have drug lords. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=555.94s)]
*  We have people that we don't want to — we have [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=557.2s)]
*  prisoners. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=559.0s)]
*  They emptied out Venezuela and many countries. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=559.66s)]
*  They emptied out their prisons into the United [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=562.4s)]
*  States. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=564.6800000000001s)]
*  We have to get those people out. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=565.34s)]
*  But we have stone-cold murders — 11,888 [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=566.78s)]
*  murders. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=571.58s)]
*  We've already gotten a lot of them out of here, but [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=572.4599999999999s)]
*  we don't want them. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=574.9s)]
*  So we have to be careful. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=575.56s)]
*  But I never want to hurt our farmers. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  Our farmers are great people. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=578.8s)]
*  They keep us happy and healthy and fat. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=580.9799999999999s)]
*  The Press. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=583.28s)]
*  Are there other cities that you're going to try to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=583.9399999999999s)]
*  replicate what you've done in Los Angeles? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=584.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, we had a big victory last night in the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  court — Court of Appeals — with respect to Los [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=589.5799999999999s)]
*  Angeles, but really the country, where Gavin [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  Nuscombe, who's really an incompetent governor — [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=595.12s)]
*  he's just doing a terrible job between his [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=598.92s)]
*  fires, between all the houses burning down, his [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=601.6999999999999s)]
*  forest fires, and now Los Angeles. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=604.66s)]
*  If we didn't go to Los Angeles — and the sheriff [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=607.6999999999999s)]
*  admitted it, he had no control. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=610.0s)]
*  He would have lost control. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=612.24s)]
*  We saved Los Angeles by having the military go in. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=613.74s)]
*  And the second night was much better. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=617.88s)]
*  The third night was nothing much. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=620.98s)]
*  And the fourth night, nobody bothered even coming. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=623.26s)]
*  We put out that fire. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=625.98s)]
*  We did a great job of it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=627.22s)]
*  He sued us for going in and for helping him. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=628.92s)]
*  We went and helped him. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=631.68s)]
*  Right now, you'd have Los Angeles burning to the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=633.12s)]
*  ground. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=635.48s)]

*  a peacemaker? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=641.02s)]
*  Are you worried that striking Iran would change that? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=641.9s)]
*  Always a peacemaker. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=644.6s)]
*  That doesn't mean sometimes you need some [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=645.76s)]

*  Can you win in Iran without ground forces? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=651.74s)]
*  Is an aerial campaign in Iran enough, or do you [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=655.08s)]
*  need ground forces? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=658.6s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to talk about ground forces. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=659.5600000000001s)]

*  Does Iran have two weeks, or could you strike [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=663.6s)]
*  before that? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=665.74s)]
*  Are you essentially giving them a two-week timeline? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=666.5s)]
*  I'm giving them a period of time. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=668.3000000000001s)]
*  We're going to see what that period of time is. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=669.48s)]
*  But I'm giving them a period of time. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=671.08s)]
*  And I would say two weeks would be the maximum. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=673.08s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think deportations should [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=676.32s)]
*  focus on criminals or all people who are here [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=679.08s)]
*  illegally? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=682.22s)]
*  We should start focusing on criminals. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=682.88s)]
*  And that's what we've been focused on. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=684.96s)]
*  Very bad criminals, dangerous criminals. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=686.9399999999999s)]

*  illegally. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=695.06s)]

*  Mr. President, if there are — if there is an [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=701.3s)]

*  Well, if there's an attack, we'll know almost [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=712.54s)]
*  immediately with modern equipment who made the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=714.64s)]
*  attack. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=716.8s)]
*  And those people will be very, very unhappy. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=717.4599999999999s)]
*  Would you say — [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=719.74s)]
*  Prime Minister — [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=720.74s)]

*  One more. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=725.38s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu said that they had the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=726.0799999999999s)]
*  capacity to take out all of Iran's nuclear [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=728.02s)]
*  facilities. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=730.0799999999999s)]

*  be able to play? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=732.42s)]
*  And why would they, if Israel says that they [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=733.42s)]

*  Well, I'm not sure he said that, but they really [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=737.06s)]
*  have a very limited capacity. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=740.3s)]
*  They could break through a little section, but they [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=742.52s)]

*  Maybe it won't be necessary. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=749.62s)]

*  Would you like to see Congress pass a bill that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48hZFd1ZVw4&t=752.7199999999999s)]
