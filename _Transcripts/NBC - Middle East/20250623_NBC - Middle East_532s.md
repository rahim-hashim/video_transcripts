# Iran 'feels obliged to respond' to U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities: Fmr. CIA Director
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc)
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior national security correspondent Courtney QB. Courtney, what are the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=0.0s)]
*  possible parts or paths Iran could take to retaliate? And what American targets does the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=4.8s)]
*  U.S. military believe are most at risk right now? So the biggest concern is that they will go after [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=10.32s)]
*  a U.S. military base or asset like a ship in the region. Remember, the U.S. has about 40,000, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=15.6s)]
*  give or take, men and women that's in uniform and civilians throughout the Middle East. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=21.76s)]
*  And that includes a number of thousands of them who are out at sea on ships. Now, we have seen Iran [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=26.479999999999997s)]
*  retaliate in the past. After the killing of Qasem Soleimani, of course, Iran launching a number of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  ballistic missiles at a base housing Americans in Western Iraq called Al-Assad. But we've also [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=38.56s)]
*  seen these proxy networks also lash out at Americans in recent years, including launching [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=44.16s)]
*  things like rockets or mortars, even drones at some of the smaller U.S. military bases, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  particularly in Syria, but also in Iraq. That is the biggest concern is that they will work [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=55.04s)]
*  to somehow overwhelm the existing defenses of some of those bases. But it's not just these little [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  ones that are at risk right now, Ana. There's also defense officials also concerned about some [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=66.88s)]
*  of the bigger bases in the region. And you also have reporting about a potential threat here at [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=70.8s)]
*  home. Iran sending a private message to President Trump before this attack warning that they could [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=76.16s)]
*  activate some sleeper cells on American soil. What more are you learning? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=81.44s)]
*  Yeah, this happened during the G7 in Canada, an intermediary passing a message from Iran directly [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=85.36s)]
*  to President Trump warning that if he were to decide for the U.S. military to take action in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=91.28s)]
*  Iran, that Iran could activate these sleeper cells in the United States and unleash some sort of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=96.88s)]
*  terrorism here domestically. Now, of course, this was before President Trump decided to very [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=103.28s)]
*  quickly leave the G7 early on Monday, saying that he needed to come back to D.C. because he [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=109.84s)]
*  needed to deal with this evolving and tense situation in the Middle East, particularly in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  the strikes with the strikes between Israel and Iran, Ana. Okay, Courtney Hubey, we know you're [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=120.16s)]
*  continuing to dig into the reporting. Thank you so much for bringing us those updates. And now I [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=124.56s)]
*  want to bring in former CIA director and senior national security and intelligence analyst for [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=128.88s)]
*  MSNBC, John Brennan. Director Brennan, Iran has said Americans in the region are all targets. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=134.08s)]
*  We also have this new warning about Iranian sleeper cells here in the U.S. What are you most concerned [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=141.28s)]
*  about this morning? Well, I think at this point, Iran is still trying to decide how it's going to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=145.84s)]
*  respond because I do believe it feels obliged to respond to the military strikes that we've [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=151.12s)]
*  conducted. And so I don't think they're going to alienate regional neighbors such as the Gulf [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=155.44s)]
*  States, whether it be Qatar, Saudi Arabia or the UAE. As Courtney pointed out, the U.S. naval [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=161.12s)]
*  assets in the Gulf, I think, are possible targets because they're taking place on the international [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  waterways of the Persian Gulf. But also Iran has tremendous capability if they choose to exercise [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=172.72s)]
*  it in terms of terrorism. They are the leading state sponsor of terrorism. And they do have assets [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=179.52s)]
*  and sources basically in Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia and so on. And whether or not they have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=185.76s)]
*  sources here in the United States or assets that could be used to carry out these attacks, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  I think is a question. And I know the FBI, DHS and state and local officials now are looking [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=197.76s)]
*  very closely at any individuals who may have be affiliated with the Iranian regime. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  What is Iran's calculation in deciding what levers to pull and what realistic capabilities [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=208.48s)]
*  do they have given just how degraded their military is, the number of high ranking officials [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=213.76s)]
*  who have been killed, the Ayatollah forced into hiding by all accounts, Iran appears to be in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=218.0s)]
*  survival mode. Yes, and certainly their military capabilities have been depleted. They still have [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=221.84s)]
*  missile rocket capabilities that they could in fact use in the general area. I think inside of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=228.0s)]
*  Iraq, there are a number of Iranian militias that continue to operate there and could target U.S. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=233.44s)]
*  forces. But again, I think they're trying to calculate exactly what they can do that is going [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=239.68s)]
*  to be responsive to the U.S. military strikes, but without triggering even more devastating U.S. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=244.56s)]
*  military strikes. And it is tough. And I think as General Hurtling said earlier, the Iranians, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  I think, see time being on their side a bit. They don't feel maybe that it's imperative to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=255.36s)]
*  strike immediately. They could do some things. They could have some of their proxies reach out [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=261.6s)]
*  now and carry out some strikes against U.S. diplomats or U.S. citizens. But again, I think [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=265.84s)]
*  they're going to be looking at this from the standpoint of what should they be doing over [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=271.28s)]
*  the course of the next several weeks, months and even years. And it took about five days for Iran [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  to launch the response after the killing of Soleimani back in 2020. So that's something for [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=280.0s)]
*  all of our viewers to keep in mind. U.S. officials have concluded or at least have discussed that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  they are unsure exactly what happened to those three nuclear facilities. We know they put a dent [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=293.92s)]
*  in Iran's enriched uranium stockpiles, according to the officials. But could Iran have moved those [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=301.44s)]
*  stockpiles or the majority of them? How does the U.S. find out how much uranium Iran still has? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  That's going to be tough to decide. I know that there was some movement in terms of vehicles [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=313.68s)]
*  at some of these facilities prior to the strikes. So they could have moved some of that highly [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=318.48s)]
*  enriched uranium outside of it. But I think it is going to be up to a variety of intelligence [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=322.72s)]
*  collection systems, whether it be human sources, technical collection, imagery, and so on. But the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  IAEA also will be doing some evaluations. So that bomb damage assessment is going to take some time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=332.72s)]
*  But I think unless we have people actually inside of these facilities, we're really not going to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=339.76000000000005s)]
*  have a conclusive view of exactly how extensive and how thorough the damage was. And it's still [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=344.72s)]
*  unclear how far along these programs were. I want to play some sound of what we've heard from the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=351.68s)]
*  Trump administration about their assessment of Iran's nuclear program and its proximity to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=355.52s)]
*  developing a nuclear weapon. Let's listen. The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=368.24s)]
*  suspended in 2003. What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? Your [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=373.52s)]
*  intelligence community has said they have no evidence that they are at this point. Well, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=378.4s)]
*  then my intelligence community is wrong. Who in the intelligence community said that? Your Director [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. She's wrong. What new intelligence does the U.S. have [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  since then that the Iranians have changed their position on nuclear weapons? And does this new [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=392.64s)]
*  intelligence come from U.S. sources and methods, or are we getting this information from other [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=398.88s)]
*  countries? Well, I would just simply say that the President's made it very clear. He's looked at [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=404.24s)]
*  all of this, all of the intelligence, all the information, and come to the conclusion that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program is a threat. Just how important is it to nail down this answer? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=413.92s)]
*  Because right now it's all over the place. Well, it was, I think, very important to nail it down [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=421.36s)]
*  prior to the U.S. decision to carry out the U.S. military strikes. But by all accounts, it's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=426.88s)]
*  apparent that there is no new intelligence that indicates that the Iranians have moved forward [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=431.84s)]
*  with their nuclear weapons program that was suspended in 2003. And unfortunately, I think [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=437.11999999999995s)]
*  this is Bibi Netanyahu and the Israelis that convinced Trump to disregard the position of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=443.28s)]
*  the U.S. intelligence community and to basically move forward and to try to destroy the nuclear [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=449.2s)]
*  program. But again, no indication at all that there was any imminent threat or that the Iranians were, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=454.64s)]
*  in fact, moving forward with their plans to, any plans to fabricate a nuclear warhead. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=459.68s)]
*  Do you think we'd be in this position now if the U.S. had not pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=465.76s)]
*  in the first Trump administration? Absolutely not, because the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=471.2s)]
*  Fordow was prohibited from enriching uranium until 2030. And so Trump's decision to tear up [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=476.08s)]
*  that agreement and to abandon it, the Iranians were adhering to it. The United States was not. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=483.2s)]
*  I think the United States has had a chance to prevent this from happening. But unfortunately, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=488.4s)]
*  I think the Trump administration has decided to go forward with Bibi Netanyahu's plans to do as [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=494.88s)]
*  much damage as possible inside of Iran and go toward regime change. Former CIA Director John [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=500.32s)]
*  Brennan, as always, thank you very much for offering your expertise and your insights. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=506.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzIJzITZLOc&t=517.84s)]
