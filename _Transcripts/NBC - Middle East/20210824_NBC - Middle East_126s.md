# U.S. Has 'Real Leverage' Over Taliban, Rep. Houlahan Says
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA)
*  Do you get the sense that we have any leverage over the Taliban right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=0.0s)]
*  And if so, what is that leverage and is it usable now? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=4.2s)]
*  Yes, we do have real leverage. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=7.84s)]
*  I think it's something like 75% of the Afghan budget is actually money from outside, whether [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=10.96s)]
*  humanitarian efforts or not. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=16.34s)]
*  That's a huge amount of money. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=17.92s)]
*  I think it's estimated that about $9 billion of Afghan resources, money in their treasury [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=19.56s)]
*  is now held outside of the country, which is a significant, significant portion of that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=25.84s)]
*  money and much of that is held by U.S. banks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=30.52s)]
*  So we hold in many ways the thing that's most important to a government, which is resources, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=33.64s)]
*  money, making sure that they can keep their citizenry safe and content. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=39.76s)]
*  And I think those are huge leverage points that we have and that we will use. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=44.36s)]
*  Is there a point where we're going to have to recognize them and sort of deal with them [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=50.2s)]
*  the way we might deal with a country we don't like their leadership with, but it's their leadership? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=53.68s)]
*  That was part of the conversation today and has been part of the conversation over the past week [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=59.96s)]
*  is, you know, at what point do you need to make sure that you recognize no matter how much you [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=65.76s)]
*  don't respect a government, recognize a government. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=71.6s)]
*  And the point I think of recognition is when they follow the rules of civil governments and civil [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=74.16s)]
*  societies that are recognizable by the 140 or so countries that are out there recognizing governments [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=79.96s)]
*  at this time. I think something like 107 countries, they were saying in our briefing, we're all behind [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=85.63999999999999s)]
*  this idea of making sure that we are thoughtful about how we recognize if we recognize whatever [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  government evolves out of this chaos in Afghanistan right now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=95.16s)]
*  That's an awful lot of the world stage that is thinking about this issue of how we recognize and who we recognize [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=98.6s)]
*  and when do we recognize their government. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3g-PmPUgcA&t=104.47999999999999s)]
