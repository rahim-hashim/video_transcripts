# ‘Continued instability and violence in the Middle East’: Sen. Van Hollen on Trump’s Amb. to Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs)
*  And joining us now is Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who serves on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=0.0s)]
*  Foreign Relations Committee, notably. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=4.24s)]
*  Senator, thank you very much. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=6.04s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about Mike Huckabee's appointment to the—to be ambassador to Israel, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=7.72s)]
*  not appointment, I should say, him being chosen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  He has to be confirmed, and you would be one of those voting on this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=16.28s)]
*  He said that Palestinians have no right to the land in the West Bank. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=19.88s)]
*  They just happen to live there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=23.48s)]
*  He's also talking about the possibility of annexing the West Bank, which would abrogate [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=24.96s)]
*  all of these UN resolutions, Camp David, the two-state solution. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  What is your reaction to him? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=35.72s)]
*  He's an evangelical Christian and has, you know, strong religious views about this, based [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=37.64s)]
*  in the Bible. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=44.6s)]
*  Well, Andrea, it's good to be with you, and I definitely have the concerns that you just [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=45.6s)]
*  laid out here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=52.64s)]
*  It's going to be an interesting hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=53.68s)]
*  we get to that point, because anybody who knows the Middle East recognizes that the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=56.64s)]
*  best long-term solution to guarantee both Israel's security and the dignity and security [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=62.72s)]
*  and rights of the Palestinian people is a two-state solution. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=69.92s)]
*  What Mike Huckabee has said is just the opposite. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=75.48s)]
*  He supports this concept of a greater Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=79.72s)]
*  Controlling the entire territory from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  That's a Mike Huckabee vision. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  It's a vision that has been embraced by the far right in Israel, including members of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=91.28s)]
*  the Netanyahu government, like Smotrich and Ben-Gavir. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=96.68s)]
*  So this is a recipe, if he continues to pursue these views, for continued instability and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=100.56s)]
*  violence in the Middle East. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=109.72s)]
*  So this is not a good signal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=112.0s)]
*  Hopefully, you know, we'll see what Mike Huckabee says again at the time of his confirmation [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=116.44s)]
*  hearing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=122.72s)]
*  I will point out, Andrea, that the new Israeli ambassador to the United States that was appointed [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=123.72s)]
*  by Netanyahu after Trump was declared the winner is a super right-winger. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=129.56s)]
*  He was raised in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=137.88s)]
*  He then became part of the JDL, the Jewish Defense League, which was later declared a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  terrorist organization by the United States. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=146.2s)]
*  He was part of the Kahanist movement, which was this extreme right movement in Israel [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  that was actually banned in Israel and on the U.S. terror watch list. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  And he is a settler who believes in annexation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=159.76s)]
*  So in both the Netanyahu appointment as Israeli ambassador to the United States and Donald [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  Trump's appointment as our ambassador to Israel, you see this far-right vision of Israel [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=170.4s)]
*  essentially taking over the entire area of what they call Greater Israel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=177.48s)]
*  That is a recipe for instability and continued conflict. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=183.24s)]
*  There's also the pick of Steve Witkoff as special envoy to the Middle East. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=190.24s)]
*  He is a real estate guy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=196.76s)]
*  He's a Trump friend. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=198.48s)]
*  He's a believe in charge of the Trump inaugural. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=199.48s)]
*  So he's a money man, a donor and a good friend of Donald Trump's golf partner. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  Do we know of any diplomatic experience that he has to be negotiating a ceasefire or any [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  other kind of agreements in the Middle East? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=216.44s)]
*  I've been trying to learn more about him, Andrea. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=217.44s)]
*  I don't think he has any experience in the Middle East. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  As you say, he's a business guy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  One of the many mistakes that the Trump-1 administration made in this area was the idea [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=226.6s)]
*  that somehow if you just put enough money on the table, you will entice the Palestinian [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  people to essentially bargain away their aspirations for political rights and dignity going forward. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=240.12s)]
*  If that's the idea that this is like some big real estate deal where you're just going [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  to again try to pay off people to surrender their dignity and rights, it's not going to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=256.68s)]
*  work. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=262.44s)]
*  And, you know, finally, the choice of Fox News host and military veteran Pete Hegseth [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=263.44s)]
*  as the defense secretary. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=269.48s)]
*  He has denounced diversity, equity and inclusion. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=271.4s)]
*  He disagrees with women in combat. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=274.36s)]
*  I don't know what he would say to Senator Duckworth, you know, and all the other women [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=276.68s)]
*  pilots, some of whom, like Senator Duckworth, you know, were grievously wounded in combat. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=282.14s)]
*  But women have been a key part of piloting these fighter jets. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=289.62s)]
*  And this goes back, you know, more than a decade. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=296.94s)]
*  So this would not be for you to vote on until it would get to the floor if it gets out of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=300.38s)]
*  committee. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, a very troubling history of statements like that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=308.3s)]
*  We know that women can perform incredibly ably in our military, like Senator Tammy Duckworth [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=313.38000000000005s)]
*  did. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=321.38000000000005s)]
*  So this is concerning, just as the earlier conversation you were having is concerning, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=322.94000000000005s)]
*  where the president would try to sort of just pick generals who have personal loyalty to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  him, not to the Constitution. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=333.70000000000005s)]
*  People who are more sort of political cronies rather than people who are best for our national [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=337.14s)]
*  security. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=342.96s)]
*  And we're also, of course, seeing that possibility when it comes to the federal civil service, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=343.96s)]
*  where Donald Trump, the president-elect, is talking about essentially firing people who [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=349.48s)]
*  are part of the merit-based civil service and replacing them with political cronies [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=355.44s)]
*  going forward. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=360.56s)]
*  That would also be very dangerous to our country. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=361.56s)]
*  So lots of very, very bad signs, a lot of things that we were worried about during the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  election seeming to come home to roost. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=371.72s)]
*  A lot of people are saying, though, that the choice for secretary of state, which has not [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=375.92s)]
*  been officially announced as of the last moment I checked my phone, but has been confirmed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  by multiple sources, that that is one positive note of Marco Rubio being someone who has [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=385.36s)]
*  worked across the aisle and has been a very good vice chair of Senate Intelligence and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=390.82000000000005s)]
*  a member of Foreign Relations. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=394.76s)]
*  So I, look, I've worked with Senator Rubio on a number of things, including with respect [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=397.52s)]
*  to China. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=402.32s)]
*  I look forward to the hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to get his full [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=404.76s)]
*  views on a range of issues. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=409.48s)]
*  That's the way the process works. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=411.52s)]
*  I congratulated him on his nomination. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=413.8s)]
*  But you're leaving it there. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=416.56s)]
*  He's more hawkish on China than you, I suspect. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=420.76s)]
*  Well, my view is that there are lots of overlapping views on China. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=424.44s)]
*  I think we all recognize that we have to deal with the challenge that China poses, both [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  on the economic front as well as on the security front. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=435.68s)]
*  So I'm not saying that there's a huge amount of daylight on those issues. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=438.92s)]
*  We have to—there's some overlap. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=444.44s)]
*  There may be some differences. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=445.96s)]
*  But I also want to get a better sense of, you know, how he's going to operate within [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=447.68s)]
*  the Trump administration on a whole range of issues that impact our global interests. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbUhTHlYhs&t=453.44s)]
