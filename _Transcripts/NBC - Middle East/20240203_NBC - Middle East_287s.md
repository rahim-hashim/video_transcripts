Video Description: Iran has long been a great instigator and a major power in the Middle East and beyond. But one thing that gave the U.S. and the West at least some mechanisms to keep Iran at bay was the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, more commonly known as the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal. It loosened sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on the country’s nuclear program. And it opened up a line of communication between the signatories of the deal and Iran. But in 2018, President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement — unraveling the deal and making it nearly impossible for President Biden to undo the damage.

# Velshi: The JCPOA built some good faith between Iran & the West. But not anymore
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM)
*  The United States has retaliated against Iranian targets in Iraq and Syria in response to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=0.0s)]
*  deaths of three U.S. soldiers in Jordan last week. It's President Biden's most forceful response yet [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=5.12s)]
*  to attacks by Iranian-backed militia groups since the Israel and Gaza started on October 7th. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=11.84s)]
*  Iran has long been a great instigator and a major power in the Middle East and beyond, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=18.56s)]
*  but one thing that gave the United States and the West at least some mechanism to keep Iran at bay [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=23.68s)]
*  was the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the JCPOA, more commonly known as the 2015 Iran Nuclear [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=30.16s)]
*  Deal. In 2015, the United States, UK, China, France, Russia, and Germany signed on to the JCPOA, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=40.0s)]
*  which loosened sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on the country's nuclear program. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=47.68s)]
*  The goal of the deal was to prevent the revival of Iran's nuclear program, but the agreement did [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=53.2s)]
*  much more than that. It opened up a line of communication between the signatories of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=58.96s)]
*  deal and Iran. It was a multilateral diplomacy tool that helped reduce the prospect of conflict [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=63.76s)]
*  between Iran and its rivals in the region. It's widely considered one of President Obama's most [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=70.72s)]
*  important international diplomacy achievements of his presidency. And for all intents and purposes, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  the deal was working. In 2016 and 2017, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=82.64s)]
*  that Iran had met its preliminary pledges, agreeing not to produce uranium to the point [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=90.08s)]
*  of nuclear enrichment. But in 2018, President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=96.0s)]
*  unraveling the deal, rendering it ineffective, causing a ripple effect for years to come, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=102.4s)]
*  making it nearly impossible for President Biden to undo the damage. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=107.2s)]
*  Trump called the deal, quote, rotten and one sided. He reinstated devastating banking and oil [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=111.44s)]
*  sanctions on Iran, which crippled its economy once again. At the time of the U.S.'s withdrawal from [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=117.2s)]
*  the deal, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to Twitter to say that Trump's, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=123.68s)]
*  quote, corpse will be worm food before the country of Iran falls. Needless to say, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=129.12s)]
*  Iran was not happy with the pullout. In 2019, Iran began enriching uranium at higher levels [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=136.16s)]
*  and developed new centrifuges for uranium enrichment. And last year, 2023, United Nations [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=143.2s)]
*  inspectors found that Iran was enriching uranium to close to weapons grade levels. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=150.72s)]
*  But Iran's escalations exploded beyond nuclear development. As we're seeing play out now, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=156.56s)]
*  the regime and its proxy groups increased their regional aggression. Iran-backed militias have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=162.56s)]
*  helped fuel insurgencies and civil wars in Syria and Yemen. Iran is now more embattled and it is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=167.2s)]
*  more emboldened. And moderates who existed within the Iranian government when the 2015 nuclear deal [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=174.96s)]
*  was signed are gone. In 2020, a new hardline parliament was inaugurated in Iran. While already [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=182.16s)]
*  existing domestic politics had a lot to do with Iran's shift in government, many experts say that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=189.84s)]
*  Trump's pressure campaign hoisted the hardliners to the front and the top of the Iranian regime. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=195.36s)]
*  So when President Biden came into power, negotiating with Iran was nearly impossible. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=201.52s)]
*  Wasn't for lack of trying, for the first year of Biden's presidency, his administration attempted [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=207.12s)]
*  to resurrect the 2015 nuclear deal. But Tehran refused to engage directly with U.S. diplomats. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=211.84s)]
*  Talks have now been stop and go for several years. And then something happened in 2022, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=218.88s)]
*  which made matters even worse. The war in Ukraine. You see, the original nuclear deal depended on [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=223.36s)]
*  cooperation between the West and Russia. But once Russia invaded Ukraine, any collaboration with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=229.52s)]
*  Moscow was off the table. And now Iran is helping Russia in its war. Iran's attack drones are a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=235.04s)]
*  common feature in Russia's campaign against Ukraine. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal built at [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=242.08s)]
*  least a little good faith between Iran and the West and created an avenue for discussion and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  for diplomacy. Without it, America has no negotiating partner across the table, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  either to bring the temperature down on attacks across the Middle East or to help settle Israel's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  war with Hamas. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJemQ5DFfjM&t=264.32s)]
