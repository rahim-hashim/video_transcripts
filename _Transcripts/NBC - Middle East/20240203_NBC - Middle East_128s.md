# Pentagon deputy press secretary: Airstrikes in Iraq and Syria were 'extreme success'
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI)
*  Join me right now, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh. Welcome, Sabrina, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=0.0s)]
*  on this very sober Saturday. Glad to have you here. You've just heard that report from Keira [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=4.96s)]
*  Simmons. So first, here's what I want to ask. What is the initial assessment of those strikes in the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=9.84s)]
*  light of day there? Did all intended targets get hit? Well, thanks, Alex, so much for having me [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=14.72s)]
*  today. This is something that our team, the central command and also with our joint staff, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=20.88s)]
*  is still assessing the battle damage assessment. So that's ongoing. We feel confident that we were [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=25.44s)]
*  able to strike the majority of our targets. We believe that we had the intended success [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=30.16s)]
*  that the mission had. But again, it's something that we are still assessing, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=36.0s)]
*  and hopefully we'll have more to share in the coming days. How much can you tell us about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=41.04s)]
*  who got hit? Because we know Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the militias, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=46.08s)]
*  they were among the intended targets. Can you confirm whether any Iranian forces died or were [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=51.2s)]
*  casualties to some extent in the strikes? Yeah, I've seen some of those reports about casualties. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=57.6s)]
*  Again, this is something that our team is doing an assessment on to figure out exactly what the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=63.28s)]
*  casualty numbers will be. I don't have those numbers for you. Again, as I mentioned, this is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=68.64s)]
*  something that's ongoing. But we believe we had extreme success in targeting the 85 targets that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=73.12s)]
*  we hit yesterday. But again, this is something that the team is continuing to look at. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=79.68s)]
*  And as mentioned, as Kieran mentioned in his report, this is a multi-prong strategy. This was our [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  first response late yesterday. And we will continue to hold those forces, whether it be [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  IRGC-backed militias or their affiliate groups responsible for the attacks on U.S. forces, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=97.28s)]
*  and of course, for the death of our three service members that we had earlier this week in Jordan. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=103.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrx75g2vGI&t=109.68s)]
