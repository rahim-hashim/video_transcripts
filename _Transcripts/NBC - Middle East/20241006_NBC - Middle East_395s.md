# Ali’s hope for humanity in the next year
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE)
*  Tomorrow will mark one year since the tragedy of October 7th, 2023. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=0.0s)]
*  Much remains unresolved in a part of the world where living without resolution is commonplace. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=5.0s)]
*  Neither Palestinians nor Israelis should be punished, kidnapped, or killed for the misdeeds of their governments, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=10.0s)]
*  or those of the worst among them, or those who came before them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=16.0s)]
*  I had hoped in the days since October 7th that things would have improved in that part of the world [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=21.0s)]
*  and in the way we discuss it here in America. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=26.0s)]
*  But hearts have expectedly hardened, and the collective dehumanization that preceded October 7th is worse than it was a year ago. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=29.0s)]
*  We're not meaningfully better at even discussing this fraught issue, let alone at striving to solve it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=37.0s)]
*  There are no two sides to the Middle East. There are dozens of sides, and we as humans are capable of holding many of them at the same time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=43.0s)]
*  The people who populate that much troubled land, regardless of the political views they hold [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=51.0s)]
*  or the perilous situations in which they live are in many cases genetic cousins. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=56.0s)]
*  And whether they are Jewish, Muslim, Christian, or Druze, they are descended theologically of the same Abrahamic faith. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=61.0s)]
*  And perhaps most importantly, they're all children or grandchildren or great-grandchildren of trauma, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=69.0s)]
*  generational trauma that imprints on one the ability to dehumanize others. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=76.0s)]
*  But it doesn't have to be like this, or at least it doesn't have to end this way. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=81.0s)]
*  Awful things have happened in the last year in a place where awful things have been happening for the better part of 100 years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=86.0s)]
*  There's plenty of blame to go around for the situation in the Middle East, but blame solves nothing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=92.0s)]
*  It is my sincere hope one year later that we reconcile around this matter for the sake of everyone involved, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=98.0s)]
*  that we step back from othering people because of their long-held and possibly valid views on the issue, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=105.0s)]
*  that we cease to see political disagreement on how to solve the Middle East conflict as a battle against an enemy that we must defeat. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=112.0s)]
*  Noh Gatarnapolsky, the Israeli journalist who was on air with us a year ago, reminded me that the problem with competing dialogues, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=120.0s)]
*  the sort of which we've occupied by for the last year, is that while they might be intellectually or emotionally satisfying, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=127.0s)]
*  they're fundamentally unproductive. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=135.0s)]
*  Noga believes we should resist the urge to privilege whatever narrative occupies space in our brains [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=137.0s)]
*  and replace it with the difficult truths that exist on the ground. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=142.0s)]
*  We must admit facts that inconvenience our ideological positions for the sake of those who continue to suffer and to die and to live in fear. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=146.0s)]
*  Noga reminded me of our responsibility as journalists to push away from bias and toward generosity in our public dialogue about the Middle East. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=155.0s)]
*  Deanna Butu, a Palestinian lawyer who was also on air with us one year ago, as this was all unfolding, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=164.0s)]
*  added that the ability to move forward in the region relies on a universal recognition of the most basic and fundamental rights of humans, all humans. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=171.0s)]
*  So my wish is that in this coming year we collectively understand that the region is beset by terrible governance, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=180.0s)]
*  institutions that are not broadly supported by citizens, and a whole lot of really bad actors. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=187.0s)]
*  But despite that, the region is populated by passionate people with the most human of desires to live in peace, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=192.0s)]
*  to control their lives, and to have responsible and accountable government. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=199.0s)]
*  These are people who hold a multitude of political opinions across the entire political spectrum, much like we do in the United States. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=204.0s)]
*  Imagine if those various and multiple views could be well debated both here and there, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=211.0s)]
*  within a context that allows people of vastly divergent political persuasions to live peacefully, either among or adjacent to one another. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=217.0s)]
*  We're in the middle of the days of awe on the Jewish calendar, where we aim to get written into the book of life for the next year. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=228.0s)]
*  My additional hope for this year is that a great and enduring understanding emerges around Israel and Palestine, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=235.0s)]
*  replacing the mistrust and the hatred that is literally killing people daily, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=242.0s)]
*  and that we in the West support and encourage mutual understanding, respect, empathy, pluralism, above all else, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=247.0s)]
*  both in the region and perhaps equally importantly, among ourselves here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=253.0s)]
*  It is our lot in life, and it's not a bad lot, to live among those who have different views. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=259.0s)]
*  It was the basis of the founding of this nation almost 250 years ago. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=265.0s)]
*  When we get it right, which we sometimes do, it is America's finest and most valuable export. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=269.0s)]
*  Now, don't misunderstand me. I know this isn't simple, and there are a lot of non-starters to this conversation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=278.0s)]
*  But a very tough conversation is better than no conversation at all, which is largely where we've arrived. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=284.0s)]
*  Let's resolve to have those truly difficult conversations respectfully, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=290.0s)]
*  and forgo simply scoring points and accusing those with whom we do not agree of having nefarious motives. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=294.0s)]
*  Let's really stretch ourselves to try to understand and maybe even articulate the opinions of those with whom we strongly disagree. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=300.0s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that anyone sacrifice their views or their strongly held beliefs, nor that we overlook atrocities. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=308.0s)]
*  But this is a call to let go of our prejudices and our preconceived notions. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=316.0s)]
*  It's a call to seek a solution above seeking to be right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=320.0s)]
*  For my part, I'm going to contribute to having even better conversations with more people from a broader spectrum of perspectives on the Middle East than I've had until now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=325.0s)]
*  It's not going to be easy, but nothing ever is as it relates to that part of the world. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=334.0s)]
*  The Jewish-American poet Muriel Rukeyser wrote, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=339.0s)]
*  So let's change the world. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=342.0s)]
*  Let's redouble our efforts to look long and hard at one another, to validate one another without accepting opinions which we cannot countenance, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=358.0s)]
*  to respect that conflicting ideas and opinions can be held without resulting in war and death and destruction. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5Y352AWE&t=366.0s)]
