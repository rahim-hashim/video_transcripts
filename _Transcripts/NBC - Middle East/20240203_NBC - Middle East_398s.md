Video Description: MSNBC's Ali Velshi speaks with Sen. Tim Kaine about the U.S. retaliatory air strikes against Iran-backed militias in the Middle East. “I worry that we have lost focus on the hostages,” says Kaine. Kaine says that focusing on efforts for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may be the best chance for wider regional de-escalation. “It would be foolish for the U.S. to be involved in another war in the Middle East.”

# Tim Kaine: Hamas hostage deal is 'only path to de-escalation'
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8)
*  All right, joining me now is the Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. He's a member [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=0.0s)]
*  of some important committees here, the Senate Armed Services and the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=3.68s)]
*  Senator, I want to pick up right from where Keir left off. Keir is saying that it appears [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=8.24s)]
*  the United States is trying to achieve its objective in sending a message to these Iranian-backed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=13.76s)]
*  militias to not get involved and to certainly not attack U.S. installations and troops, at the same [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=19.04s)]
*  time, to not escalate this into a regional war starts to become very blurry as to what an escalation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=24.88s)]
*  is. There have been 160 attacks plus on U.S. troops and then what we saw last night. What's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=31.2s)]
*  your sense of it? Well, Ali, you're asking the right question. There has to be a consequence [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=36.48s)]
*  for anyone that kills American troops, and so going against those groups identified as responsible [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=42.72s)]
*  for the deaths of these three reservists from Georgia, very understandable, and that's within [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=48.8s)]
*  the president's self-defense powers. But the president has said with respect to the attacks [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=54.24s)]
*  on the Houthis in the Red Sea that they don't expect the attacks to de-escalate. More missiles [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=60.56s)]
*  fired at Houthis is likely to lead to more missiles fired on ships in the Red Sea. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=66.0s)]
*  And so the strategy of these attacks and then hoping to de-escalate thus far isn't working. And [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=71.44s)]
*  I think there's only one path to de-escalation right now. The U.S. should pursue it with vigor, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=77.76s)]
*  and that's a hostage deal. To release hostages still held by Hamas. You'll remember that in the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=83.12s)]
*  first hostage release, there was a pause that enabled humanitarian aid to go into Gaza, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  and these groups in the region that were fomenting attacks on the United States [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  dramatically de-escalated their operations. And so CIA Director Burns is in the Middle East [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=101.84s)]
*  working on this. I think all focus now should be on a hostage deal. That would be good for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=108.4s)]
*  hostages and their families. It would likely be accompanied by a significant pause in hostilities [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza. We could get much more humanitarian aid in, and that would be the most likely path [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=120.56s)]
*  to see de-escalation right now. So this is, I'm glad you brought those in. They're two separate [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  issues, but they are deeply connected here. Is there some concern, because I have spent the week [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=131.76s)]
*  feeling more optimistic than I have since October 7th, about this deal that has been starting to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=136.72s)]
*  take form between the CIA, Mossad, the Qatari Prime Minister, and the Egyptians, and the fact [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=143.52s)]
*  that the Israelis, despite Netanyahu's stated public misgivings, have said that they could be [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=148.24s)]
*  on side with something that looks like this deal? And Hamas, not having dismissed it out of hand [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=154.16s)]
*  either, does do these attacks, the attacks on Tower 22 and these retaliatory attacks, tell me [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=159.2s)]
*  the way in which that complicates the possibility of a deal that could end the Israel-Gaza war, at [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=165.6s)]
*  least lead to a ceasefire? Well, it complicates it in one sense, Ali, but it also may underline [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=171.44s)]
*  how critical it is. In a way, I worry that we'd sort of have lost focus on the hostages. We were [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=177.92s)]
*  focused on the military operation in Gaza, and then how do we counter-strike against the Houthis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=184.0s)]
*  But I think hostages are the key to this. First, there's a humanitarian imperative that they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=188.88s)]
*  should be released. So that is the beginning point. But second, the only evidence that we [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=194.4s)]
*  have about what will produce a de-escalation was the first hostage release deal, which did [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=200.16s)]
*  produce a de-escalation. And obviously, if you get into a significant humanitarian pause when [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=206.32s)]
*  hostages are released, you can negotiate to extend the pause. You can negotiate for more robust [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=212.32s)]
*  delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israel has a right to defend itself, but most of us have [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=219.28s)]
*  been extremely disappointed about the way Israel has throttled the delivery of humanitarian aid [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=224.32s)]
*  into Gaza to help suffering people who have nothing to do with Hamas. We need to up the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=230.56s)]
*  pace of humanitarian aid. That can happen during the pause, and that also gives us an opportunity [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  to discuss a lengthening of the pause. That will be the most likely path to de-escalation, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  and it's also the path that I think has the most humanitarian imperative behind it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=247.84s)]
*  So, Senator, you and I have been talking for years, and I love the way you think things [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=253.76s)]
*  through, and I think it makes a lot of sense what you're saying. The one thing that worries me is, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=256.96s)]
*  when talking about Hamas, we talk a lot about Qatar as the intermediary that we use, a country [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=260.96s)]
*  very friendly to the United States where we've got bases. But we do know that Hamas is also [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=267.12s)]
*  influenced by Iran. Is there a danger in these retaliatory strikes that Iran says to one of its [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=272.16s)]
*  allies, one of these proxy groups, Hamas, now is not the time to make a deal as a result of this? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=278.96s)]
*  It's possible, but what we're seeing, Ali, and it's been publicly reported, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=285.84s)]
*  that Iran is also, while they are supporting these Iranian-backed militia groups, or supporting [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah, supporting Hamas, supporting the Houthis, they themselves see danger in a broad [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=298.64s)]
*  escalation in the region. So we're seeing that. And look, from the U.S. standpoint, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=304.32s)]
*  it would be foolish for the United States to be involved in another war in the Middle East. It [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=310.0s)]
*  would be absolutely foolish. We have a very intense focus right now on trying to help Ukraine [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=313.92s)]
*  succeed in its defense of its sovereignty against a dictator who's illegally invaded it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=320.56s)]
*  Vladimir Putin loves the world's attention being drawn to the Middle East. We've said that the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  pacing challenge for the United States in the 21st century is the U.S.-China relationship. Xi [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=331.52s)]
*  Jinping would love for the United States to get bogged down in the Middle East. There's some in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=336.64s)]
*  the Middle East who, for their own reasons, wouldn't mind us getting bogged down there. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=341.28s)]
*  It would be foolish for us to be involved in a war in the Middle East. Should we support [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  democratic allies? Sure, we should. But to have U.S. troops involved in protracted hostilities in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=349.76s)]
*  the Middle East would be foolish, and it would suggest we hadn't learned anything from the last [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=355.84s)]
*  two and a half decades. So there's a lot of danger right now. As Kyr indicated, it's a tense [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=360.56s)]
*  situation, but there is an ongoing discussion about hostages that I believe could be the key [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=367.04s)]
*  to de-escalation. Let's keep our focus on that and not get distracted. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHtFoS7Csp8&t=373.2s)]
