# Israel preparing for retaliatory strike from Iran and proxies
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM)
*  NBC's Ellison Barber is reporting from Tel Aviv, also with us, Jamil Jaffer, founder and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=0.0s)]
*  executive director of the National Security Institute and former counsel to both the House [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=5.44s)]
*  Intelligence and Senate Foreign Relations Committees. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Thank you both for being here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Ellison, we understand the Israeli government is now telling people to stock up on food [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=14.56s)]
*  and water to prepare safe rooms at home. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=19.2s)]
*  What's going on where you are? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=22.32s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, you know, Israeli officials never really doubted that Iran would at some point [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=24.12s)]
*  do what they said. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=30.68s)]
*  From the minute the Supreme Leader of Iran said, we believe since Ishmael Kania was killed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  in our territory and that they believed Israel was behind it, the second that he said, we [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  have no other choice but to take revenge for his death, Israeli officials had been saying [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  consistently they expected Iran to follow through on that and to carry out what they [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  were describing as likely a multi-day attack that also involved Iran's proxies. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=50.54s)]
*  It fluctuated at different points on exactly when it could be, how big it could be, and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  whether or not Hezbollah in Lebanon would do something on their own or started off and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=60.5s)]
*  then Iran would follow. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  But Israel has consistently said they believe that Iran will do something and that they [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=66.14s)]
*  think it will be bigger than the strikes they saw Iran carry out against Israel back in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=70.14s)]
*  April. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=75.04s)]
*  Towards kind of the middle and the end of last week, we had heard Iran sort of soften [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=76.72000000000001s)]
*  some of their rhetoric, at least publicly. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=81.72s)]
*  That wasn't the case with Nasrallah and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but Iran did sort of kind of seem [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=83.72s)]
*  like they weren't as aggressively saying a strike is coming soon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=90.36000000000001s)]
*  Everything changed, though, when that school inside of Gaza, in the area of Gaza City, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=94.36000000000001s)]
*  was struck by three different rockets. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  There are differing accounts of why that school was hit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=102.12s)]
*  Hamas and Gaza health officials, they say this was a school that had been turned into [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=104.88s)]
*  a refugee area and over 4,000 people were displaced and seeking shelter there and that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=109.8s)]
*  those strikes occurred during morning prayers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=115.6s)]
*  Israel claims that this was an area, a school compound that was being used by Hamas as a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=118.4s)]
*  command center and that ultimately they claim they killed about 20 Hamas and Palestinian [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=123.96s)]
*  Islamic Jihad terrorists who they say were inside. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=129.6s)]
*  Hamas denies that, so does Islamic Jihad, and about 100 people, according to Gazans, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=131.92s)]
*  a civil defense, were killed in this strike. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=137.32s)]
*  But it was that moment that we heard Israel go back in on their rhetoric. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  Almost immediately after that strike, a senior political adviser to Iran's supreme leader [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  released a statement saying they viewed that strike as evidence that Israel was trying [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=148.24s)]
*  to ignite a larger regional war and that they said they had already taken the necessary [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=153.2s)]
*  steps required to extract what they described as the harshest punishment on Israel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=159.2s)]
*  We know today Iran's president spoke with the secretary of state from the Vatican and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=165.11999999999998s)]
*  told him in that call, according to reporting in Iranian state media, that Iran does not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=170.48s)]
*  want to go into a war but that ultimately they believe, given the assassination, that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=178.2s)]
*  they say Israel was behind Avishma Khania and also the killings, they say, of women [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=183.16s)]
*  and children inside of Gaza, that their only choice is to respond to that moving forward. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=188.02s)]
*  We have spent time in the last week meeting with volunteer EMTs in Israel and they tell [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=193.82000000000002s)]
*  us the thing they're most worried about right now is that a large scale strike from Iran [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=200.38s)]
*  could target electrical infrastructure and send this country into darkness. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=204.58s)]
*  They say they've staged pop-up areas in the event of a mass casualty event, but they're [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=210.34s)]
*  first thing that could go out and that it could be days would be communications within [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=215.42s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=219.42s)]
*  Chris? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=220.42s)]
*  Ellison, Barbara, thank you for that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=221.42s)]
*  So, Jamil, what do you think Israel should be getting ready for? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=222.42s)]
*  Well, look, I think we have to expect, as Ellison says, a significant attack, either [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=225.89999999999998s)]
*  one from Hezbollah in the north coming across in response to the killing of Fawad Shakur, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=230.77999999999997s)]
*  one of their top military commanders, and or an Iranian response in the form of drone [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  strikes, missile strikes, and the like coming over from the mainland of Iran. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=240.42s)]
*  Israel will almost respond with a direct attack against Iran as well, but the question really [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=244.38s)]
*  is how many Israelis will potentially lose their lives if Hezbollah comes across with [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=248.5s)]
*  those 150,000 rockets that we believe they have stored there just north of the Lebanon-Israel [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=252.9s)]
*  border. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=258.7s)]
*  That, I think, is the biggest question. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=259.7s)]
*  We know that Israel's at all-time lows when it comes to its air defense capabilities in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=261.12s)]
*  terms of David's slaying Iron Dome and the like in terms of those rockets, so that will [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=265.54s)]
*  be a challenge as well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=270.46s)]
*  continue to resupply, but that would be one of the big questions in play over the next [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  few days. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=275.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, in addition to resupplying, as you know, Jamil, the Pentagon confirmed it's sending [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=276.29999999999995s)]
*  a guided missile submarine and another aircraft carrier strike group to the region. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  Does that change the calculation at all on either side? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=285.14s)]
*  Well, you know, Chris, the question, I think, is what the Iranians read that the purpose [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  of those vessels as being. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  In the past, the U.S. has used those vehicles to help shoot down and take down incoming [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  Iranian missiles. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  I think it's highly unlikely the U.S. is looking to get into any kind of a shooting war with [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=299.74s)]
*  Iran unless this tips over into a major regional conflict, which at this point it hasn't. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=311.22s)]
*  I think there's some possibility, but a small possibility that happens. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  I think more likely we'll see a response by Iran, a response by Israel, and then an effort [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=318.06s)]
*  to bring things to a more calm situation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=322.38s)]
*  What that could be done or not is the hard question, Chris. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=324.58000000000004s)]
*  You think there could still be something that happens diplomatically, I mean, given, especially [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=327.44s)]
*  at least in the near term, that those ceasefire talks are set to resume Thursday, but Hamas [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=331.96s)]
*  isn't going? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, look, without Hamas there, it's hard to imagine how those things move forward. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  The real question is how to bring pressure on Iran. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=341.96s)]
*  At the end of the day, Iran is the effort behind Hezbollah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=344.08s)]
*  They're the financial backers of Hamas. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  Unless Iran is held accountable for their bad behavior in the region, whether that's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=349.76s)]
*  Hamas, the Houthis in the Red Sea, Hezbollah in the North, or Hamas in Gaza, you're unlikely [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=352.8s)]
*  to see a larger resolution or return those hostages who both Hamas and Iran see as their [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=357.44s)]
*  key negotiating leverage in this larger conflict. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=362.2s)]
*  Jamil Jaffer, always good to see you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=365.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuty8Um2KqM&t=382.8s)]
