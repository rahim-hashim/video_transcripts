# Israel is ‘bracing for an attack that could come at any time’: Engel
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk)
*  Joining me now from Jerusalem is NBC's chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=0.0s)]
*  and New York Times diplomatic correspondent Michael Crowley. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=4.88s)]
*  So Richard, while I catch my breath, tell us about the additional deployments from the U.S. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=8.64s)]
*  and what you're hearing on the political divisions within Israel about what happened. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Sure, Andrew, and I hope you get a glass of water. It's tough to be talking 24-7, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  and this is about to be potentially a very busy time, because people here are bracing, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=27.76s)]
*  and they are bracing for an attack that could come at any time from any place, really. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=33.44s)]
*  And there's a lot of speculation. I've been speaking to military officials for the last [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=39.84s)]
*  several days. There was thinking that there could be a strike on Israel or U.S. bases in the region [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=44.64s)]
*  on Friday. Then people thought maybe it was going to come on Saturday. Now there's talk it could [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  come tonight or in the next few days. So really, they don't know when, but they're trying to prepare [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=56.72s)]
*  for an attack that could come at any moment. That's why I think we're seeing all of these [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=64.08s)]
*  additional deployments. That's why Israel has just confirmed that General Eric Kurila, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=68.8s)]
*  the commander of CENTCOM, is now in Israel, and that is the same situation that we found ourselves [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=74.24s)]
*  in on April 13th. April 13th is a key day to remember. It was just three and a half months [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=80.64s)]
*  ago now, but it was the first time that Iran attacked Israel directly in response to an Israeli [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  strike on an Iranian diplomatic facility, an embassy annex in Damascus that killed a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=96.72s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard leader. And at the time, Iran fired over 110 ballistic missiles, more than [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  200 drones in Israel, and nearly all of them were shot down. But a war almost broke out, and I think [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=110.4s)]
*  the U.S. and Israel are both scrambling now to prevent a similar situation, to stop any incoming [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=118.0s)]
*  attacks and prevent it from escalating into a much more regional war. There's also diplomatic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=125.2s)]
*  activity going on in the background, a lot of it. And Michael Crowley, on that front, it was very [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=131.36s)]
*  clear from what the president said at Andrews, at Joint Base Andrews the other night when greeting [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=137.76s)]
*  the hostages, when asked a question. He's not happy about the assassination in Tehran of the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=141.92s)]
*  political director for Hamas, who was the chief negotiator on the hostage talks. And a lot of the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=149.04s)]
*  allies are not happy as well, the European allies, from what we're hearing, that, you know, there was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=154.16s)]
*  not criticism of the Hamas attack, the attack on Hamas, rather the Hezbollah leader in Lebanon, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=159.6s)]
*  but there has been a lot of internal criticism, and there was a very tough conversation, we are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=167.2s)]
*  told by a lot of sources, I don't know what you're hearing as well, between President Biden [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  and Bibi Netanyahu, the fact that he was in town all last week and that there was no signal at all. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  And not that the U.S. wants to be told in advance of an attack on Iran, that would make us complicit, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=185.76s)]
*  but they were really upset that it was not discussed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=190.88s)]
*  That's right, Andrea. And, you know, added to that, Prime Minister Netanyahu came and gave a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  speech to Congress that was pretty combative. He thanked the Biden administration for supporting [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=200.4s)]
*  Israel, but overall, I don't think the White House was super happy with his visit. So there was [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=205.84s)]
*  tension already, and of course, tensions going back months now. But definitely the United States [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=211.44s)]
*  was not happy with the strike against the Hamas leader in Iran, because, Andrea, there are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  basically two overriding priorities for the Biden administration right now. Number one is to try to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=221.04s)]
*  get a ceasefire in Gaza to try to bring the conflict to an end and open the door to this [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=226.48s)]
*  larger grand diplomatic bargain that might normalize relations between Israel and Saudi [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  Arabia. They really want that ceasefire. And then number two, they want to prevent an escalation of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  the Gaza conflict into a regional conflict that would involve, that would pit Israel and Iran in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  ongoing warfare that would be very likely to drag in the United States. So Netanyahu goes ahead and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=250.72s)]
*  launches this very provocative strike in Tehran against a senior Hamas leader, which, number one, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=257.04s)]
*  I think U.S. officials assess at a minimum, postpones the possibility of a ceasefire for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=262.8s)]
*  days, weeks, maybe longer. And number two, hugely embarrasses and provokes Iran and puts them, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=268.32s)]
*  puts Iran in a position where it has to strike Israel. So on those two priorities, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=275.76s)]
*  that strike against the Hamas leader, however satisfying it may be and however deserve it, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=280.48s)]
*  it might be in a moral sense, really sets back those two priorities and makes the whole situation [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=285.2s)]
*  much more dangerous and difficult to manage. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYe2wT7hVpk&t=291.36s)]
