# ‘Horrific situation made worse’ with little humanitarian aid going into Gaza: Sen. Merkley
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak)
*  And joining us now is Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, first, we have a lot to get to today, but let me ask you about the lack of progress on getting the food in. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=5.2s)]
*  There's a show of an effort. The last 72 hours, as our correspondent Ralph Sanchez just reported, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  but from all that I'm reading with the U.N. food aid people, the relief organizations are just not seeing it on the ground. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=20.2s)]
*  Well, it has been really a year in which Israel has put up so many obstacles to both nutritional aid, food aid, clean water, medicine in Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=28.4s)]
*  And it has put the United States in the position of being complicit with this horrendous level of suffering. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=41.4s)]
*  So I had hoped that the 30-day notice that President Biden put out in combination with a good outcome in the election might have dramatically changed that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=48.4s)]
*  It's been now at least three weeks that virtually no aid has gotten into northern Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=57.6s)]
*  So a horrific situation has made that much, much worse. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=62.6s)]
*  And unfortunately, it doesn't look like there's going to be much change in that approach. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=68.6s)]
*  We're going to continue to see very little humanitarian assistance make it to the several million people who are there in Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=72.6s)]
*  And of course, if this, as expected, becomes Marco Rubio's State Department, and his confirmation would be relatively easy, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=81.8s)]
*  compared to some of the choices that have been floated, a lot of the career people at the State Department and others are relieved that a senator [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=93.8s)]
*  who was the vice chair of Senate Intelligence and on the Foreign Relations Committee, you've worked with them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=102.8s)]
*  What is your take on Marco Rubio as the next Secretary of State? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=107.8s)]
*  Yes, I think he's a very good nominee. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=111.0s)]
*  I have worked very closely with Marco Rubio on issues from the Uyghur Force Labor Prevention Act. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=114.0s)]
*  We paired up on that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=119.0s)]
*  To the Taiwan Relations Act, we've worked together on issues related to Hong Kong [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=121.0s)]
*  and blocking the provision of tools that the police use in Hong Kong to suppress dissent. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=128.0s)]
*  So there's a human rights element to his work that has been significant. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=135.0s)]
*  He's been the chair or co-chair of the China Commission that I also am a co-chair on. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=140.2s)]
*  So we've worked very closely on these issues. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=146.2s)]
*  He's someone you can sit down and talk to and have, and he's well informed on foreign affairs. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=148.2s)]
*  What do you think of Mike Wall's congressman from Florida, former Green Beret, many Bronze Stars, as National Security Advisor? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=154.2s)]
*  That's not a confirmable post, as you know. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=163.2s)]
*  I do not have any background working with him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  So I'm going to be, obviously, as you point out, it's not confirmational. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  So I won't be spending a lot of time looking into that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  But I am interested to see what his background is, what he will bring to that conversation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  But I don't have any insight to bear on it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, something I know you know very well and are passionate about is the environment. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  And Lee Zeldin, the New York congressman, Republican congressman, who has in the past criticized the EPA, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=190.6s)]
*  been in favor of withdrawing from the Paris Accords, is going to be the new head of the EPA if he's confirmed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=197.6s)]
*  This is obviously a significant concern, but I will say his record is not as extreme as many. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=204.6s)]
*  He was part of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=212.6s)]
*  But when it comes right down to it, what really matters here is the guidance that the Trump administration is sending him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  We saw the friction between, say, Trump and Attorney General Sessions and how they fell out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump is going to be Trump's vision that drives this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  So whatever recognition there might be in terms of Lee Zeldin, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  it's going to be very much the Trump team saying, crank up the fossil fuels and tear down any advancement on going to renewable energy economy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=242.0s)]
*  This is probably the biggest issue humanity faces. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=252.0s)]
*  Seven generations from now, people are going to say, what did you do to stop this runaway warming of the planet? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=257.0s)]
*  And the United States has to be a world leader on this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=263.0s)]
*  I can't expect other countries to act if we're not acting, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=267.2s)]
*  and I'm afraid that that incredibly important effort has been profoundly set back. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=271.2s)]
*  I think we have some comments that Zeldin made in the past about climate change. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=277.2s)]
*  Let me play that for you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=283.2s)]
*  I'm not sold yet on the whole argument that we have as seriously a problem with climate change as other people are. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=286.2s)]
*  That was in 2013, I'm told. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=297.2s)]
*  That is before he joined, I believe, the Climate Solutions Caucus, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=301.2s)]
*  and we saw a lot of additional evidence about climate. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=305.2s)]
*  But on the other hand, those who are seeking to curry Trump's favor have been very reluctant. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=309.2s)]
*  We used to have many Republicans who were climate champions. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=314.2s)]
*  There was a time, if we go back to when Dukakis ran for president, Dukakis ran on coal and Bush ran on climate. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=318.2s)]
*  So we've seen a dramatic change, and it does point to the corruption of our elections by Citizens United [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=325.4s)]
*  and the vast money from the fossil fuel industries that has come into play. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=331.4s)]
*  I think it's important for us to understand there's the science that so many members understand on both sides of the aisle, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=336.4s)]
*  and then there's the politics, and the politics on the Republican side of the aisle don't speak up too loudly on climate. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=343.4s)]
*  And we can also remind people that the Environmental Protection Agency was created by Richard Nixon, a Republican president, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  and that the first head of it was William Ruckelshaus, a well-known environmentalist, I think, from your part of the country as well. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  And the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, so all very much Nixon administration. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJQ41KZLMak&t=381.4s)]
