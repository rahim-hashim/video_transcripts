# 'Let's go make some deals': Trump's Mideast tour
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08)
*  It is day 115 of the second Trump administration, and welcome to the midweek nightcap. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=0.0s)]
*  The president's tour of the Middle East continued with a state visit to the Gulf nation of Qatar, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=6.48s)]
*  which he called a funder of terrorism in 2017. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=11.64s)]
*  Well, fast forward to Trump's second term and his announcement today that the country's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=14.6s)]
*  airline agreed to purchase more than 200 new planes from Boeing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=19.0s)]
*  The luxury jet that Qatar plans to give Trump was not discussed, but the country's prime [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=23.5s)]
*  minister addressed it on Fox News. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=27.92s)]
*  There are really unfair accusations for Qatar's trying to buy an influence. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=29.840000000000003s)]
*  Throughout the last 25 years or 30 years, you will see, you will find Qatar always by [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=35.72s)]
*  the side of the U.S. in many areas and many things. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=42.88s)]
*  That assurance will probably do little to stem the growing concerns about this exchange, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=48.0s)]
*  and NBC News analysis found that it would cost $1 billion and several years to turn [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=52.6s)]
*  the 747 into Air Force One. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=57.64s)]
*  Say that five times. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=61.4s)]
*  And taxpayers would likely have to foot the bill. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  Our own Garrett Haake has more on day two of Trump's mid-each trip. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=64.84s)]
*  Trump is the first president to visit Qatar in more than two decades, which is home to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=70.6s)]
*  America's largest Middle Eastern military base, but has also drawn criticism, including [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=74.36s)]
*  from the president, over its close ties with Hamas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=79.36s)]
*  The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  level. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=90.56s)]
*  And the president facing more Republican blowback over his plan to accept a $400 million luxury [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=91.56s)]
*  jet from Qatar, gifted to the Pentagon to serve as a temporary Air Force One amid Boeing's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=96.72000000000001s)]
*  ongoing delays delivering a replacement. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=102.56s)]
*  How do you know something's not implanted and it doesn't blow it up? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=105.0s)]
*  So obviously there's a concerted security concern there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=109.0s)]
*  I can think of a lot of other things Qatar could do for us, like, for example, quit harboring [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=112.92s)]
*  Islamic jihadist terrorists who are trying to kill Americans. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Overnight, the president defending his decision on the deal, which has not yet been finalized. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=120.88s)]
*  With the United States of America, I believe that we should have the most impressive plan. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=125.28s)]
*  Now, some people say, oh, you shouldn't accept gifts for the country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=129.72s)]
*  My attitude is, why wouldn't I accept the gift? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=135.11999999999998s)]
*  We're giving to everybody else. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=137.11999999999998s)]
*  Why wouldn't I accept the gift? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=138.64s)]
*  Because it's going to be a couple of years, I think, before the Boeing's are finished. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=139.64s)]
*  And this morning, President Trump meeting briefly with the new Syrian president, a former [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=143.64s)]
*  al-Qaeda member who broke with the group and once had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  head before deposing dictator Bashar al-Assad. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  Trump lifting U.S. sanctions on the new Syrian government at the request of Saudi Arabia [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  and Turkey. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=160.88s)]
*  He's got the potential. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=162.28s)]
*  He's a real leader. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=163.28s)]
*  And he led a charge. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=164.28s)]
*  And he's pretty amazing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=167.28s)]
*  With that, let's bring in our nightcap. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=170.28s)]
*  Melanie Zanona, NBC Capitol Hill correspondent, Jason Johnson, politics and journalism professor [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=171.92s)]
*  at Morgan State University. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=177.64s)]
*  He's also an MSNBC political contributor. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=179.44s)]
*  And Sam Stein, managing editor for The Bullwork and MSNBC political contributor. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=181.98s)]
*  Well, well, well, I would like to say that Qatar versus Qatar is the blue dress of 2025 [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  thus far. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  I just want to put that out there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  Okay? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  Sam, okay. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump's foreign policy strategy is touting billions in foreign investment with [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  very few details. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  And to me, it feels like he is not necessarily operating as an American president, but really [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  as an arm of some of his businesses. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=214.48s)]
*  And like, he's a businessman. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=216.88s)]
*  But what are your thoughts on this? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=218.84s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=220.64s)]
*  I mean, I think the central thesis of this trip is let's go make some deals, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=221.64s)]
*  Bring not just world leaders together, but tech leaders, business leaders, cut deals, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=226.88s)]
*  some astronomical sums of money being thrown around or being reported as being thrown around. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=232.2s)]
*  But then if you, of course, get to the details, it's much vaguer. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=236.72s)]
*  And it's, you know, I don't want to sound like I'm adopting a cliche. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=239.88s)]
*  But it is a realignment of basic American foreign policy, the first trip overseas to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=244.84s)]
*  petrostate autocrats, cutting deals with them, cozying up to them, saying of MBS, I [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=248.52s)]
*  may love him too much. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=254.72s)]
*  All the while simultaneously launching trade wars and attacks on democratic allies, it [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=256.64s)]
*  is kind of a dizzying reorientation of U.S. foreign policy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=263.44s)]
*  But it does sort of fit the Trump pattern, which is he kind of marvels at their ability [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=266.36s)]
*  to do what they do. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=271.92s)]
*  He kind of wishes he had the flexibility that comes with an autocracy, and he's not really [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=273.68s)]
*  even hiding it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=278.24s)]
*  You know, one of the Mideast experts told the Washington Post that monarchs in the region [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=279.24s)]
*  really don't distinguish between their personal interests and national interests. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=285.88s)]
*  And Jason, it feels like Donald Trump is like, yeah, we want to do that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=290.72s)]
*  The man showed up and got a free plane, OK, a free plane. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=294.92s)]
*  Let's like, we can stop everything. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=298.44s)]
*  That he might not even take because Republicans and Democrats are pushing back. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=299.44s)]
*  Which makes it worse, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=302.84s)]
*  But because this is, look, the way that these things used to work in a semi-functional, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=303.84s)]
*  non-authoritarian regime is that when you met a foreign leader, they might give you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=308.02s)]
*  like, I don't know, a jersey from a team that won the World Cup or a ring or something else [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=311.3s)]
*  like that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=316.1s)]
*  What they don't do is give you planes, right? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=317.1s)]
*  So that's a sign already of how Trump operates, which we all have problems with. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=319.1s)]
*  But if you get into the details, Pam Bonner used to be on the Qatar payroll. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=323.24s)]
*  The Trump Foundation wants to build like a golf course there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  This is a personal business trip that Donald Trump is taking at the taxpayer's expense. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=330.26s)]
*  That's what this whole thing is about. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  That's what it should be reported as. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=336.14s)]
*  And what bothers me the most is that Republicans can sit there and say, we don't like the plane, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=337.34s)]
*  but all the other deals that are being done, all the other deals that are being done that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=342.42s)]
*  personally benefit him and don't help the taxpayer, they don't have anything to say [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=345.82s)]
*  about it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=348.62s)]
*  You know, and I had lots of qualms with the plane. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=349.62s)]
*  Sam and I were talking about it in the makeup room, and I said, nobody is talking about [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=351.02s)]
*  how this plane, he won't even be able to use it as an Air Force one because it has to be [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=354.18s)]
*  outfitted. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=358.7s)]
*  And Sam's like, lots of people are actually talking about it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=359.7s)]
*  He's like, people are talking about it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=361.74s)]
*  We're talking about it right here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=363.3s)]
*  OK, look, Melanie, we also saw Trump with the new leader of Syria. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=364.7s)]
*  And I do think it is important to note that the president is talking about lifting sanctions. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=369.5s)]
*  Some Democrats are giving cautious praise on this to the president, actually. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=375.3s)]
*  I want to know what you're hearing, because only Congress can take the leader off of that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=380.7s)]
*  terrorist watch list, can lift the sanctions. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=387.85999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump cannot do this, you know, laterally. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  So I'm surprised, actually, by the praise that some Democrats have offered us. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=391.58s)]
*  Yeah, Democrats are pretty reluctant to praise Trump on just about anything. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=395.34s)]
*  So it was interesting to see a handful, not many, but a handful of Democrats come out [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  and praise him on lifting those sanctions from Syria. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=401.97999999999996s)]
*  But Republicans, on the other hand, were not coming out and supporting him for this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=405.97999999999996s)]
*  I think behind the scenes, there is a lot of consternation amongst your more traditional [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=409.78s)]
*  hawks, your old school Republicans, your Lindsey Grahams of the world, for example, who are [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=414.09999999999997s)]
*  still trying to reorient themselves around this new MAGA world foreign policy order. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=418.58s)]
*  And I think this trip in the Middle East is just a perfect example of how Trump has really [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=424.06s)]
*  taken a more transactional approach to the presidency, but also, to Sam's point, you [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=428.53999999999996s)]
*  know, slapping tariffs on allies and then cozying up to people that were once considered, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=433.62s)]
*  you know, taboo to even take meetings with at one point. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  Not even taboo. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=440.73999999999995s)]
*  The current leader of Syria was literally the founder of the Al Qaeda chapter in Syria. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=441.74s)]
*  He was a jihadist. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  He has disavowed, okay, he has disavowed it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=448.86s)]
*  So I guess I can say he was a former alleged jihadist. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=452.38s)]
*  But this is what this is. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=455.86s)]
*  It is unconscionable. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=457.86s)]
*  For me, someone who used to work in the federal government, used to work for an American president, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=458.86s)]
*  this is unconscionable. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=464.7s)]
*  But it's not surprising, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=465.7s)]
*  This is why none of our allies want to share national security information with us anymore. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=466.7s)]
*  This is why, you know, our European allies are like, look, we've got to reorient ourselves [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=471.42s)]
*  for the next 20, 25 years. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=475.36s)]
*  Because you have a foreign policy. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=477.16s)]
*  We don't have foreign policy anymore. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=478.90000000000003s)]
*  What we have is whatever Trump's personal business interests are. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=480.7s)]
*  So since we don't know what that is when he wakes up every day, it leaves the rest of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=484.06s)]
*  the world trying to figure out and scramble one way or another. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=487.5s)]
*  This no longer have foreign policy. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=489.78000000000003s)]
*  And that's the dangerous thing, because this is a part of a world that matters. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=491.88s)]
*  The resources there matter. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=495.18s)]
*  Our relationships there matter. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=496.38s)]
*  But we don't know if we can do anything with it because we don't know what Trump's going [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=497.90000000000003s)]
*  to care about day in, day out. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=500.98s)]
*  Well, you know, I think some people would say, well, we don't have a foreign policy [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=502.18s)]
*  that we're used to, I guess, so we're going to all keep going back to the point Sam made. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=505.06s)]
*  You've got, this is New York Times reporting, and this is, I'm going to read it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=508.54s)]
*  Qatar, or Qatar, depending on who you are today, has continued to try and transform [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  its reputation in the global community, in part by spending millions of dollars on lobbyists [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=516.7s)]
*  in Washington and other capitals. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=521.3000000000001s)]
*  Among those lobbyists was Pam Bondi, now Mr. Trump's attorney general. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=523.3000000000001s)]
*  It seems like their investment has fang off. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=529.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, again, no one knew she was going to be the attorney general. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=532.1s)]
*  She was not the first pick, to be clear. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=534.5s)]
*  She was the second. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  True. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=537.42s)]
*  But, you know, when foreign governments make these investments, it's long-term investment [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  here. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=542.2199999999999s)]
*  I agree, keep going back to the same word transactional. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=543.2199999999999s)]
*  And I think that's really what defines this, which is, if you're the government of Qatar, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=545.5799999999999s)]
*  you look at Donald Trump, you say, what's the best way to earn his favor? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=549.54s)]
*  And it's not, you know, by appealing to his epic humanitarian record or his morality [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=554.14s)]
*  or anything like that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=560.02s)]
*  It's to give him a gift. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=561.02s)]
*  Or it's to hire a lobbyist who has good access to him. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=562.46s)]
*  Or it's to hire a lobbying shop that has good access to Washington, D.C. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=565.62s)]
*  And so, in each of these cases—and I would even tie it back into the decision to lift [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=569.4200000000001s)]
*  the Syrian sanctions—what Trump is doing is he's saying, what's the most immediate [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=573.78s)]
*  need that I have to satisfy, and how can I get through that transaction? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40vlutCUE08&t=578.1800000000001s)]
