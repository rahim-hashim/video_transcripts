# UK Amb. To The U.S.: Need Commitments For 'Safe Passage For Afghans'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA)
*  And joining us now is Ambassador Karen Pierce, the British Ambassador to the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=0.0s)]
*  and the former British Ambassador to Afghanistan. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=4.46s)]
*  Ambassador Pierce, thank you very much. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=7.48s)]
*  There are reports, of course, that the prime minister did not want the U.S. to withdraw. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  There was certainly a discussion in Parliament by that August 31st deadline. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=13.08s)]
*  Do you think that the final word is that the U.S. is going to pull out? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=17.28s)]
*  Well, a lot of leaders, including Boris Johnson and Andrea, have been seeing if it is possible [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=21.04s)]
*  to stay beyond 31 August. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=28.16s)]
*  I think, as your report has said, the Taliban have been clear they don't want to extend [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=30.6s)]
*  Western U.S. military beyond that date. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=36.4s)]
*  So the important thing is to ensure we have commitments that safe passage for those Afghans [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=39.2s)]
*  who want to leave will continue. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  And we need all parties to recommit to that, and we need to make that a reality. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=48.68s)]
*  In the immediate term, in the next few days, we'll be making sure every minute counts [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=53.72s)]
*  to get out our own nationals, those Afghans who've worked for us, and those Afghans and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=58.76s)]
*  others who are most at risk of human rights abuses. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=64.44s)]
*  So everybody on the ground in Kabul working round the clock, and I pay tribute to our [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=67.68s)]
*  ambassador, Laurie Bristow, but also his military and other colleagues, including U.S. colleagues. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=74.16s)]
*  There's very good coordination on the ground between us, but it is an urgent task still. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=80.16s)]
*  And you've been managed to extricate some of your personnel and some of your Afghan [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=86.32s)]
*  allies from elsewhere in the country to get them to the Kabul airport. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=90.64s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=95.44s)]
*  We have a plan to call people forward. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  I think other countries, including the U.S., are doing similar things. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=100.36s)]
*  The congestion has typically been at the gates into the airport rather than the holding [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=104.72000000000001s)]
*  system bringing people forward. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=110.56s)]
*  We've managed to get 8,500 people out so far. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=112.92s)]
*  I think the U.S. has managed to get over 50,000 since evacuation began in early August. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  But as I say, we're making every minute count in the hope that we can get thousands more [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=125.12s)]
*  out in the next few days. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=130.16s)]
*  And then we look to this commitment to safe passage to continue. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=133.0s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=137.12s)]
*  All parties on the ground in Kabul work towards that so that those Afghans who want to leave, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=138.68s)]
*  who are still very vulnerable, can actually do so. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  You know Bill Burns, of course, such a veteran diplomat that you are and that he was before [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=149.28s)]
*  becoming CIA director. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Are you encouraged that he actually met with Mullah Baradar, the founder, then jailed in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  Pakistan, then freed, and part of the Doha negotiations that frankly went nowhere? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=162.48s)]
*  But are you encouraged that this may mean there is some accord for safe passage now [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=168.72s)]
*  and even after the deadline? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=176.0s)]
*  Well Director Burns, I pay tribute to him also. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=179.04s)]
*  He's an outstanding diplomat and public servant. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=182.12s)]
*  And I know that he, along with our people who are working with the Americans on this, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=186.16s)]
*  will be trying everything they can to get that safe passage commitment solidified. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=191.12s)]
*  There have been Taliban statements that people will be allowed to leave probably on commercial [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=196.8s)]
*  flights after 31 August. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=202.08s)]
*  The important thing is to codify and solidify that commitment and to carry on with as many [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=205.0s)]
*  efforts as we can manage in the next few days. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=210.84s)]
*  And then there's something very important about talks looking to the future. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  That's one reason why Boris Johnson called today's G7 meeting. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  He wants to talk not just about evacuation and resettlement and humanitarian assistance. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  He also wants the international community to come together with a clear plan for holding [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=230.11999999999998s)]
*  the new regime in Kabul to account, for protecting human rights, and for looking to future engagement. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  He very much believes that this has to be something we can only do on a united and coordinated [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  basis. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=248.56s)]
*  And to that point, you were an ambassador in Afghanistan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=249.56s)]
*  You know the realities of the Taliban regime. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=253.28s)]
*  We've also seen Russia making moves to recognize the Taliban as the government. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=256.64s)]
*  The U.S., the Secretary of State had been telling us that our key leverage on the Taliban [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=260.92s)]
*  was not recognizing them, not letting them have resources until they commit to these [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=265.48s)]
*  things, to human rights. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=270.76s)]
*  But how likely is that? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=272.4s)]
*  That's, of course, the prime minister's hope. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=274.2s)]
*  It's something G7 leaders will be discussing in great detail today, I think. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=278.08s)]
*  And in fact, a readout of the meeting should issue shortly. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=283.08s)]
*  So I don't want to preempt what the leaders have said. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  But I do think it's important that everyone understands we will judge the Taliban by their [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=290.56s)]
*  actions. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=295.12s)]
*  It is important to uphold Afghanistan's international human rights and other obligations. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=296.12s)]
*  We will be looking very carefully at how human rights are playing out on the ground, particularly [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=303.9s)]
*  for those most vulnerable like women and girls. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=308.46s)]
*  And that will be a very important factor in how we calibrate our relations with the new [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=311.14s)]
*  regime and eventually with the new Afghan government going forward. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=317.7s)]
*  You know, it's important that that government is inclusive, that it's representative, and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=321.46s)]
*  that it upholds Afghanistan's international obligations. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=327.46s)]
*  And we will take all of that into account when reaching our decisions about what sort [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=330.9s)]
*  of relationship we want to have, can have, with the new regime in Kabul. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=335.94s)]
*  There have been voices in the UK saying that this evacuation should have been planned and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=340.94s)]
*  started a lot earlier, under the US leadership, at least. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=345.78s)]
*  I think the speed and scale of the Taliban advance that they took over the whole country, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  including the capital, in just 11 days, I think that did catch everybody unaware, not [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=358.86s)]
*  just in Western capitals. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=364.74s)]
*  I think probably in Beijing and Moscow, they were surprised by the speed and scale as well. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  As soon as we could, we got evacuation plans underway, and we've been evacuating people [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  since 13 August. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=378.3s)]
*  We're not letting up for an instant. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=379.86s)]
*  We recognise there's more to do, but part of the future on this is that important commitment [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  to safe passage that we were talking about earlier. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=387.94s)]
*  Dame Karen, Ambassador from Great Britain to the US, we really appreciate your being [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=392.02s)]
*  with us on a very busy day in all of our worlds. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=397.14s)]
*  Thank you very, very much. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=400.06s)]
*  Thank you, Andrea. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tdh9Tgz_eA&t=402.14s)]
