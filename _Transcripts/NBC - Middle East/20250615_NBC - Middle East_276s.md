# Trump rejected Israeli proposal to assassinate Iranian supreme leader
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM)
*  And for that we go to NBC's Von Hilliard who's at the White House with an update on the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=0.0s)]
*  Von where do things stands? What are we learning right now? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=6.4s)]
*  Alex we're just learning here this afternoon from a US official that Israel had approached the United States the president [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=9.3s)]
*  About a potential plan to assassinate the supreme leader of Iran [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=16.98s)]
*  Ayatollah Khamenei this would have amounted to a regime change in Iran if [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=22.8s)]
*  Israel and the US had agreed to move forward with such a military effort as this in these last days of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=29.02s)]
*  Course that sort of action has not been executed upon here at this time [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=34.9s)]
*  But this comes three days now after those initial airstrikes were launched in a surprise attack on Iran [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=39.54s)]
*  And since there have been retaliatory airstrikes going between the two countries here [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=46.56s)]
*  Well for President Trump on his part here just a few hours ago in the social media posts [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=51.54s)]
*  He suggested that he still believes that there could be a quote deal between [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=56.26s)]
*  Israel and Iran to bring an end to this war at the same time this White House has indicated [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=61.18s)]
*  Repeatedly that they are in the position where they have made a case to Iran that they must halt all uranium [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=68.82s)]
*  Enrichment and stop all efforts to build nuclear bomb capabilities [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=76.74s)]
*  I want to let you listen to BB Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister in his first [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=81.38s)]
*  First interview on Fox since those initial airstrikes three nights ago in which he was very specific in talking about [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  The US's cooperation with Israel in why he decided to proceed with this attack before if folks will recall [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=93.5s)]
*  Today was supposed to be the sixth round of talks between the US and Iran on a potential nuclear agreement [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=101.14s)]
*  But the Israelis went forward with their airstrike early nonetheless take a listen [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=107.0s)]
*  I [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=112.38s)]
*  Think we achieved a great surprise the other day when we started [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=113.46s)]
*  You know we could wait and wait and wait they'd string along the negotiations. We gave them a chance [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=116.82s)]
*  I gave them a chance, but it was clear they were not serious about it [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  It became clear I think to the United States as well because the president was very clear [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=125.56s)]
*  He said you can't have nuclear weapons and in order not to have nuclear weapons [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=130.06s)]
*  You can't enrich uranium and they basically strung everybody along and it was clear to us. It was going nowhere [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=134.5s)]
*  Alex it's a serious question now the extent to which the US will militarily involve itself with Israel's future [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=142.38s)]
*  military plans of course in the same interview the Prime Minister suggested that this war would continue on Iran until [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=149.54s)]
*  They end all uranium enrichment and yet clearly your Iran has not agreed [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=157.98s)]
*  To move forward with any such plan to halt those efforts there and for the US's parts [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=164.14s)]
*  They at least presently continue to defend Israeli airspace with the US military using [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=169.54s)]
*  Pilots to shoot down drones, so there's a lot of big questions ahead here for this White House [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=176.18s)]
*  But one that US official tells us that they pushed back against a plan to take down the ayatollah and kill Iran's supreme leader [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=180.18s)]
*  Absolutely, so clearly no cessation of activities expected anytime soon very quickly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  G7 the president heads to Canada for that meeting. What are the expectations? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  Expectations there is in terms of the top issue [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=196.66s)]
*  They'll be talking about right the president is leaving just three four hours from now or so to head up to Canada [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=199.86s)]
*  We should note that it's not just the g7 leaders that will be there [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=206.1s)]
*  But other other global leaders including the Ukrainian president Zelensky have been invited to attend these talks as well [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=209.62s)]
*  This is of course the president's first trip since [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=216.58s)]
*  His economic coercion campaign to try to force Canada into becoming the 51st state of the United States [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=219.46s)]
*  so of course this will that will be on the table and undoubtedly what is unfolding in the Middle East will also be a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=226.18s)]
*  paramount concern to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=232.74s)]
*  European allies especially here as the US has really kind of made its posture of going it alone in so many regards in terms of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=234.74s)]
*  negotiations on these various [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  Conflicts overseas the question here is to to what extent do they turn to some of these other? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=244.66000000000003s)]
*  Allies and leaders to help put pressure on Russia for example to try to bring some of these wars here to an end [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=249.86s)]
*  you [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JshlYIIZmM&t=255.86s)]
