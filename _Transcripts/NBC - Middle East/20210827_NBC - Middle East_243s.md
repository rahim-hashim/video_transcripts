# Fmr. Afghan Translator Details 'Nearly Impossible' Escape From Kabul
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4)
*  Joining me now is Haroon Zubrifi, who served as a translator for the United States Marines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=0.0s)]
*  and Air Force in Afghanistan and managed to get out of Kabul with his wife and their two [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=4.4s)]
*  daughters, ages two and four, only days ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=8.68s)]
*  Haroon, I'm glad that you're out safely, but you went back to Afghanistan to help your [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=11.52s)]
*  sick father. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=16.4s)]
*  You were scheduled to fly out tomorrow. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  He was scheduled to get out tomorrow. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=20.12s)]
*  How did you get your family out? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=22.38s)]
*  What are you going to do about your other relatives behind? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=23.38s)]
*  It was, I'll tell everyone first, it wasn't really hard. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=28.04s)]
*  It was really tough to get out as everyone sees what's going on there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=32.6s)]
*  Going through all that by helping Tom Cotten's office, he helped me to get out of there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  I tried a few times before that, at least one time with my family, my wife and my child, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=45.64s)]
*  but it was really, really hard. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=51.56s)]
*  I was about to lose my daughter, as I mentioned many times. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=54.12s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=59.12s)]
*  It was impossible to get in for me with the two children to go through those crowds. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=60.12s)]
*  Eventually, Tom Cotten's office, he reached out to me and after a couple of days I was [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=66.32s)]
*  there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=73.56s)]
*  When the Taliban arrived, he managed it and he helped me to get out of there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=74.56s)]
*  We went through one of the gates. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=83.04s)]
*  We went through that crowd, but it was easier because they already managed it somehow. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=85.84s)]
*  We got closer to the American soldiers and I showed them our passports and all the documents [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=90.14s)]
*  we had. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=95.28s)]
*  They let us in and still we had to climb on the fence, which was with the barbed wire, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=96.28s)]
*  the wall. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=103.2s)]
*  They bring down the ladder, so we have to get on the ladder and go on the other side. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=104.2s)]
*  This is how I got in. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=108.76s)]
*  What about your father? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=111.4s)]
*  What news are you hearing now after the explosions? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, the other day, my father, since I was there, he was trying to go in with me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=116.4s)]
*  It was impossible, as I mentioned, that crowd. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=122.24s)]
*  It's really, really risky with the Taliban checkpoints and all that stuff in there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=126.72s)]
*  Still they're trying their best to get in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=132.48s)]
*  Even the other day when the suicide bomb happened, my two brothers, they were in there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=137.24s)]
*  One of my brother, he got injured and he's okay. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=142.0s)]
*  It was just not that bad, but he's doing okay. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=146.08s)]
*  He's fine. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=150.0s)]
*  He was there when the bomb went off? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=151.0s)]
*  Yes, he was there. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=153.44s)]
*  Two of my brother, they were in there, so they were trying to see if they can show their [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=155.32s)]
*  paperwork to someone and if they let them in so they can call the rest of the family [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=159.08s)]
*  to get in with them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=164.52s)]
*  Unfortunately that happened and they were too far because they were not able to get [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=166.16s)]
*  that close from the crowd. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=170.72s)]
*  But still, when the bomb, the suicide bomb happened, they were there and one of my brother, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=173.32s)]
*  he got hurt. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=179.0s)]
*  Well, we're hoping that he is better and that you can somehow manage to get your father [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=180.0s)]
*  out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=186.48s)]
*  It's got to be terribly traumatic for you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=187.48s)]
*  It's not only my dad and my father-in-law is the same and there's a thousand other Afghans. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=192.0s)]
*  They have their special immigration visa documents ready. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=196.12s)]
*  They're qualified to come to the United States, but it's taking time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they're trying to get in. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=205.52s)]
*  We are running out of time, so we don't have time. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=207.44s)]
*  Time is limited. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=210.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=211.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=212.32s)]
*  The window is closing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=213.32s)]
*  And they're trying to get people in because their citizens, they have to get a visa. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=214.32s)]
*  We wish you all the best. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=217.32s)]
*  Thank you very much, Haroun Zarifi, for being with us today. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmGgVemlfB4&t=220.28s)]
