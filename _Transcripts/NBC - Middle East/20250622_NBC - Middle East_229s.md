# 125 military aircraft and 25 minutes. How Operation Midnight Hammer unfolded
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI)
*  Joining us now, pending on a report of Courtney Qubee, who was in the room for NBC. Courtney, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=0.0s)]
*  what did you hear in the briefing, and more importantly, what did you not hear, and what [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=5.92s)]
*  questions do you still have? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=9.76s)]
*  Yeah, so the chairman of the Joint Chiefs laid out some of the details about this, sort [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  of the more finite things that we've all been wondering all night long. First of all, it's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=15.16s)]
*  called Operation Midnight Hammer. That was a new detail for all of us. It involved a [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=19.6s)]
*  number of B-2 bombers. That was something that we were tracking, but we found out that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=23.36s)]
*  in fact, they dropped 14 of those massive ordnance penetrators. Those are those giant [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=26.8s)]
*  bombs that we've been calling bunker busters and talking about for the last week or so. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=31.92s)]
*  They, of course, are the ones that are about 30,000 pounds, but they're only about 5 or [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=35.76s)]
*  6,000 pounds of actual explosive. Most of that weight is made up of this very strong [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=39.56s)]
*  alloy and material on the outside of the bomb that allows it to penetrate deep into the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=45.32s)]
*  earth before exploding. That allows it to go as far down as about 200 feet before the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=49.72s)]
*  explosive actually detonates. It's a capability that, as far as we know, the United States [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=55.64s)]
*  is the only country in the world that has the ability to do it. And it's why it was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  so critical at Fordow, because as we've been hearing, it is buried deep underground, upwards [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=64.12s)]
*  of about 300 feet below the surface and underneath a reinforced concrete for the most of that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=68.72s)]
*  way. A couple of things that stood out to me, the United States had about 125 different [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=73.12s)]
*  aircraft involved in that. Now, that includes everything from the bombers to additional [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=78.56s)]
*  fighter aircraft to the refuelers in the air and to drones that were put up to help protect [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=82.72s)]
*  that package. A couple of things that I was also really struck by is General Cain, the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=87.52s)]
*  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, this is the first time that we've heard from him in the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=92.88s)]
*  briefing room. He's only been on the job for a matter of weeks now. He said that when the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=95.0s)]
*  bombers went in, there were a number of additional tactical fighter aircraft that were up with [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  it. They moved ahead of the bombers to essentially protect what he was calling the package. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=104.0s)]
*  So, he said that the aircraft was moving into the targets, those bombers with those big, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=109.52s)]
*  heavy bombs. They moved in and they laid out what's known as suppressive fire on the ground, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=113.52s)]
*  meaning that they struck areas that could have presented a problem or a danger to those [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=119.16s)]
*  bombers, making it all the way to their target and dropping those 30,000-pound bombs. In [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=124.92s)]
*  addition to that, he also explained that as the entire package of aircraft were moving [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  into the airspace, they have no indication that the Iranian military at any point detected [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=135.76s)]
*  those aircraft or fired anything up at them. If in fact that is the case, that is significant. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=139.76s)]
*  It means that these U.S. aircraft were able to get in past any kind of Iranian air defense [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=145.2s)]
*  systems and radars and get back out. Now, what he didn't say and we didn't get a chance [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=149.32s)]
*  to ask was whether the U.S. actually suppressed any of those air defense radars or systems [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=153.48s)]
*  on the ground there. A couple of other things that really stood out to me here was something [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=158.72s)]
*  that I've never heard happen in a military operation like this and it was very openly [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=163.88s)]
*  explained by General Cain, is that the U.S. had a deception tactic as part of this. So [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=167.56s)]
*  they had B-2 bombers that took off out of Whiteman, went towards the Pacific, officials [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  telling us that they were headed to Guam, while the actual bombers that were going in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=178.72s)]
*  basically went in the other direction. While we were all kind of looking left, they went [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=183.28s)]
*  right for all intents and purposes. That was one of the ways that they were able to get [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  in. Last thing, 25 minute total time frame from the time that they started dropping those [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=190.64s)]
*  bombs until the final tomahawks launched off the submarine from off the coast. That's a [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=196.16s)]
*  remarkable amount of time, 25 minutes, to conduct as many as 75 different strikes in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  these three locations, guys. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pBZSEYOdI&t=208.04s)]
