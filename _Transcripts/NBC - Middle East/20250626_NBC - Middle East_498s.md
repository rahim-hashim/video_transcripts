# Yikes! Fox News’ Brit Hume slams Fox vet Hegseth for berating Fox reporter at Pentagon
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04)
*  Here are some basic facts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=0.0s)]
*  We have major problems in the Middle East on a ton of fronts. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=2.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has pursued these policies to try to contain Iran and had some [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=6.32s)]
*  success. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=11.52s)]
*  And yet the Trump administration is right now clashing over its own intelligence leaks, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=13.02s)]
*  which the government is responsible for, and clashing with reporters, which is a kind of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=18.28s)]
*  odd place to be at the highest levels of government amidst all of these important Middle East [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=24.3s)]
*  and international issues. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=29.44s)]
*  At the Pentagon today, things got downright chaotic when the Defense Secretary took on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=30.84s)]
*  reporters. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=35.56s)]
*  Because you, and I mean specifically you, the press, specifically you, the press corps, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=38.68s)]
*  because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=45.72s)]
*  against Trump, because you want him not to be successful so bad, you have to cheer against [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=51.64s)]
*  the efficacy of these strikes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=58.12s)]
*  You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=60.12s)]
*  That's a major allegation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=64.28s)]
*  That press room that he is admonishing, it's full of Pentagon reporters who do some of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  the toughest reporting out there, people who have experience dealing with intelligence, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=70.56s)]
*  military affairs, some people who end up going abroad sometimes, or their colleagues who [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=75.36s)]
*  serve in war zones where many reporters have lost their lives. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=80.1s)]
*  So saying without evidence that they are just hoping that something doesn't work or rooting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=83.56s)]
*  against the country that they are a citizen of the U.S. is a major charge when you think [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=88.44s)]
*  about it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=92.28s)]
*  Even in this time where people are used to the rhetoric, it is downright Nixonian. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=93.28s)]
*  And there is a debate over just how successful this initial Iran strike was. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=97.08s)]
*  Journalists are going to cover that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=105.0s)]
*  Some of the debate is coming from inside the Trump administration, because again, it's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=106.36s)]
*  the intelligence they oversee that had a leak that said maybe this was not as effective, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=111.2s)]
*  obliterating everything as the president had claimed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=115.76s)]
*  And yet, let's remember, across our coverage, there are plenty of experts who say that containing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=120.28s)]
*  Iran at all or setting back the nuclear program at all is, from a general U.S. and safety [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=125.12s)]
*  perspective, a positive. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=130.56s)]
*  We've heard that from experts. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=132.12s)]
*  You know, we've had actions for the last 70 years in the Middle East, and Israel and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=134.04s)]
*  the United States have always been successful. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=143.68s)]
*  It may be that we did more damage than what the Defense Intelligence Agency thinks. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=146.16s)]
*  Is this a significant foreign policy win for the Trump administration? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  It is, but let's look at it from, it is, to be fair. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=156.88s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=160.88s)]
*  Send a message to Iran that the United States is willing to do just about anything to protect Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=162.48s)]
*  Those are just three examples here on our air on MSNBC with experts we call upon, some [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=169.12s)]
*  of whom have government experience, including General Clark, talking positively about aspects [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=174.44s)]
*  of this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=179.0s)]
*  And yet, this is an administration that, as you just saw in that odd or unusual hectoring [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=180.68s)]
*  presentation from a Pentagon chief who used to be at Fox, wants to debate the role of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=186.48s)]
*  the press or try to give out orders. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=191.48s)]
*  And I don't care which party is in power, the government doesn't give out orders to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=193.48s)]
*  the press about how to cover things in the United States. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=196.76s)]
*  As for the Trump administration overseed intel, it was leaked from inside the Trump administration [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=199.94s)]
*  to the New York Times stating that the initial assessment thought those strikes partially [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=205.6s)]
*  damaged the nuclear facilities, setting them back by, quote, a few months. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  Financial Times reported on early assessments in Europe indicating that Toronto was able [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  to actually move some of the Iranian stockpile ahead of the strikes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=218.3s)]
*  Satellite images showed a convoy of trucks outside one of the facilities days before. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=222.18s)]
*  You can see that there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=226.34s)]
*  This is how intelligence works, kind of a piecemeal, a mosaic, if you will, to try to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=227.34s)]
*  understand what happened. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=232.26000000000002s)]
*  And a new CIA report seems to push back on what was that initial leak and discusses how [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=234.06s)]
*  they view the Iran site as severely damaged, key aspects destroyed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=239.9s)]
*  Now, that's a little bit of the picture. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=247.06s)]
*  And General Clark also told us over time intelligence tends to hopefully get better, so you get [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=250.1s)]
*  more of the picture. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=255.66s)]
*  The administration, though, courted this clash by, according to their own initial assessment, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  overstating the success with Trump claiming, quote, obliteration. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=270.62s)]
*  We believe we achieved destruction of capabilities there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  We have obliterated the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=279.02s)]
*  We are confident, yes, that Iran's nuclear sites were completely and totally obliterated. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=281.02s)]
*  Those pilots hit their targets. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  Those targets were obliterated. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=287.9s)]
*  Obliterated. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=289.9s)]
*  It's not a coincidence when five different people who work together keep saying obliterated. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  Obliterated and totally destroyed is a factual claim. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  And the Trump administration oversees intelligence that doesn't match that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=301.58s)]
*  And the history of misstating or spinning intelligence in the Middle East is a long [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=307.38s)]
*  and big problem, one that Trump used to criticize when it was done in the Bush administration. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=311.74s)]
*  Trump is now attacking specific journalists, trying to use government power to oust or [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  get fired, a reporter at CNN, over this issue. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  Greg Seth, you saw, calling out outlets, launching probes about the leak of the preliminary intelligence. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=325.3s)]
*  Senators also discussing the apparent uncertainty here after a briefing today. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=334.42s)]
*  To me, it still appears that we have only set back the Iranian nuclear program by a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=341.62s)]
*  handful of months. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=347.7s)]
*  There's no doubt there was damage done to the program. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=348.7s)]
*  But the allegations that we have obliterated their program just don't seem to stand up to reason. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=352.82s)]
*  Let me turn to the press clash, which so much has been normalized lately, but there's nothing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=363.14s)]
*  acceptable about the Pentagon trying to lecture reporters about how to cover facts, especially [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=369.46s)]
*  in concert with the intimidation tactics. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  And interestingly, it's even gotten into a bit of a civil clash at Fox, where of course [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  Pete Hegs has most recently worked. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=386.18s)]
*  Take a look at this exchange. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=388.42s)]
*  Jennifer, you've been about the worst, the one who misrepresents the most intentionally. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=391.82s)]
*  What the president says. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=398.3s)]
*  I'd like to say a word, if I may, Dana, about Jennifer Griffin, who was attacked by the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=399.3s)]
*  defense secretary today, an attack she certainly, in my view, did not deserve. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=404.54s)]
*  Her professionalism, her knowledge and her experience at the Pentagon is unmatched. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=409.02s)]
*  And I have then have had and still have the greatest regard for her. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=414.06s)]
*  The attack on her was unfair. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=417.97999999999996s)]
*  Is the Pentagon under Trump here and Hegs set out of line? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=420.62s)]
*  And is this a negative for an informed, accountable foreign policy to have the government trying [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=424.29999999999995s)]
*  to crack down on reporters and in this case, former colleagues? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=429.74s)]
*  Well, I also have worked with Jennifer Griffith at Fox News and Natasha Bertrand at CNN. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=434.62s)]
*  They are two pros, superb reporters, nonpartisan, really hardworking. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=441.46s)]
*  They do a great job. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=448.98s)]
*  And so I think, as you alluded to earlier, Ari, the politicization of intelligence is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  very dangerous. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=459.54s)]
*  It's not in the national interest to do it, whether you're saying that Iraq does have [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=460.66s)]
*  WMD or Iran's nuclear program has been obliterated, it doesn't serve the national interest. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwE69v9Nb04&t=465.38s)]
