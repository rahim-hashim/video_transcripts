# Israel claims to strike Houthi targets in Yemen
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s)
*  Turning now to breaking news out of the Middle East, where Israel says it has hit Houthi [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=0.0s)]
*  targets across Yemen with airstrikes. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Iran describes the attack by Israel against Yemen as a violation of peace and security. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=6.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, Palestinian officials say overnight five journalists were killed in a strike on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=11.84s)]
*  a press van in Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=16.16s)]
*  But Israel says it struck militants posing as journalists. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=17.76s)]
*  NBC's Raf Sanchez is live from Jerusalem with more. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=21.36s)]
*  Raf, what do we know about these strikes in Yemen? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  So, Christine, in just the last couple of minutes, the Israeli military confirming that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=26.88s)]
*  it was responsible for these strikes, not the first time the Israelis have attacked [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=33.68s)]
*  the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=37.6s)]
*  But this appears to be on a much wider scale than the strikes we've seen before. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=40.16s)]
*  The IDF is saying they hit the main airport in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=45.36s)]
*  They're saying that they hit two power stations, as well as what they're calling military infrastructure [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  at three different ports along Yemen's western coastline. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=56.8s)]
*  Now, they are saying all of this was being used by the Houthis for military purposes, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  that they were points of entry for Iranian weapons being smuggled in. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=66.32s)]
*  But we will see what kind of impact this has on the civilian population in what is the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=71.2s)]
*  poorest Arab country in the Middle East, a country that has been going through a decade-long [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=76.72s)]
*  rolling humanitarian crisis. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=81.84s)]
*  The Houthis have been in the sights of both Israel and the United States for nearly a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=84.48s)]
*  year—more than a year now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  But especially in the last couple of weeks, the Houthis firing a series of ballistic missiles, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=92.72s)]
*  two of them last week, broke through Israel's sophisticated air defenses and hit in the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  Tel Aviv area. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=103.2s)]
*  Nobody was killed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=104.4s)]
*  But this was pretty alarming for Israel, especially given that they have really diminished the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=105.92s)]
*  capabilities of Iran's other proxy groups, Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=110.32s)]
*  to say nothing of the Assad regime collapsing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=116.8s)]
*  So we have seen both Israel and the United States striking against the Houthis in the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=119.44s)]
*  last couple of weeks very intensively. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=124.16s)]
*  The Houthis so far seem undeterred, undefiant, continuing to fire these missiles and these [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=126.56s)]
*  drones. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=132.48s)]
*  You mentioned, Christina, the ceasefire negotiations, which are still continuing in Qatar. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=133.44s)]
*  There was a senior Israeli delegation there led by the head of the Mossad spy agency. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=138.32s)]
*  That delegation has now returned to Israel for consultations with the political leadership, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=143.44s)]
*  including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=148.4s)]
*  And we will see whether this is just a temporary stall in these ceasefire negotiations or it [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=150.72s)]
*  is something more serious, both Israel and Hamas publicly accusing the other side of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=156.4s)]
*  making last-minute demands, which are slowing down this process. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=162.24s)]
*  And at this point, it is looking very, very unlikely that we are going to get to any kind [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=166.72s)]
*  of deal before the end of the year, which is the hope that the Biden administration [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=171.28s)]
*  had expressed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=174.96s)]
*  Christina. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=175.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=176.42s)]
*  Ref Sanchez, thank you so much. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=176.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwDD0suOs0s&t=196.72s)]
