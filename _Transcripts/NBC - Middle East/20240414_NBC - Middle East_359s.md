# Israeli 7-year-old wounded during Iranian aerial attack
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI)
*  Joining me now from Tel Aviv is NBC News international correspondent Raph Sanchez. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=0.0s)]
*  Raph, with welcome to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=4.2s)]
*  So morning is broken there, and despite the size of the attack, there appears to be minimal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  damage inside of Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=10.0s)]
*  Tell us about the atmosphere on the ground right now in Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=12.68s)]
*  What's it like? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=15.88s)]
*  Well, Alex, there was real terror here last night. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=17.92s)]
*  This was a slow-motion, unfolding attack. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=21.88s)]
*  Israelis knew well before they went to bed last night that Iran had launched at that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=25.6s)]
*  point it was just hundreds of drones. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=29.6s)]
*  They knew it was going to take several hours for those drones to reach Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=31.92s)]
*  What they did not know is what would happen when they arrived. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=34.92s)]
*  So there was real fear here overnight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=38.44s)]
*  This morning, I would say that has given way to a strong sense of relief. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=41.72s)]
*  I'm just looking out over one of the main roads in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=46.36s)]
*  It's kind of quiet but calm here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  What we are not hearing, Alex, is a real clamor for retaliation against Iran from ordinary [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=52.68s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=59.8s)]
*  People I've been speaking to here in Tel Aviv say they are relieved this is over. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=60.8s)]
*  They don't want to see further escalation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=65.5s)]
*  But that obviously is going to be a decision that is up to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=68.14s)]
*  and the Israeli War Cabinet. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=72.44s)]
*  They're meeting not far from here at the Defense Ministry as we speak. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=74.08s)]
*  We have heard from some of the more far-right members of Israel's government that there [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=78.7s)]
*  should be a major response. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  But nothing that has been said by the Prime Minister or other members of the War Cabinet [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=85.66s)]
*  at this stage indicates that Israel is preparing to retaliate immediately. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  There is a lot of concern, Alex, for that seven-year-old girl from a Bedouin community [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  down in the south of Israel. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  She suffered a very serious head wound from shrapnel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  There was an interception overhead. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=106.28s)]
*  Shrapnel fell on her house. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=108.56s)]
*  She is in a hospital in the south of Israel now, and she is fighting for her life, according [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=109.62s)]
*  to doctors. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=114.12s)]
*  In terms of the other damage caused by this attack overnight, I just spoke to an Israeli [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=115.52s)]
*  military spokesman. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=120.76s)]
*  He says that there was limited damage at the Nevatim Air Base, which is down in the southern [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=122.36s)]
*  desert in Israel. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=128.5s)]
*  He says none of those impacts, which were caused by ballistic missiles, are actually [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=130.46s)]
*  affecting the operations at that air base. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=134.4s)]
*  It's a key base. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=138.04s)]
*  It's where a lot of Israel's F-35s are based out of. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=139.04s)]
*  He says there was no damage to those fighter aircraft or to any other aircraft as a result [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=142.36s)]
*  of that Iranian attack. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=147.24s)]
*  And, Alex, one of the first indications that ordinary Israelis had of how serious this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=148.72s)]
*  was last night was Israel has a government plane. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=153.8s)]
*  It's called the Wing of Zion. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  It's basically the equivalent of Air Force One. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=159.12s)]
*  It carries senior Israeli government officials around. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=161.12s)]
*  That plane took off from that southern air base around 1030 last night, and it is pretty [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=164.66s)]
*  clear now in retrospect that they were getting that plane off the ground so it wouldn't be [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=170.56s)]
*  damaged by any of these incoming missiles or drones. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=175.44s)]
*  But that was visible to Israelis on Flight Tracker on other sites, and it was a first [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=179.16s)]
*  sign at how serious this attack might be. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=184.28s)]
*  Alex? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=187.12s)]
*  Alex, I appreciate you updating us on what is happening right now with that war cabinet [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=188.12s)]
*  in Israel underway. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=192.12s)]
*  I want to ask you about one statement we have gotten. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  It's from an Israeli official who essentially called Iran's attack a failure and said that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=195.88s)]
*  Iran has made a mistake by exposing itself to the world. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  That kind of rhetoric, is there any concern about Iran not taking kindly to it and therefore [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=207.16s)]
*  creating further tension? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=215.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think Alex, the U.S., President Biden making pretty clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=218.32s)]
*  that they don't want to see further escalation, and I don't think it is helpful to have Israeli [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=225.44s)]
*  officials crowing, as it were. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=230.28s)]
*  But the Iranians made pretty clear even before any of those first drones or missiles landed [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=233.28s)]
*  last night that this was, from their perspective, a one-and-done, that they considered this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=238.16s)]
*  to be a proportional military response to what they say was that Israeli airstrike near [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  their embassy in Damascus back on April 1st. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  That was a strike that killed seven senior members of the Revolutionary Guard, and Iran [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=255.32s)]
*  says it has the right to respond militarily to that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=261.18s)]
*  In terms of where Israel goes next, it is worth noting that the Israeli government has [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=265.96s)]
*  called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=271.24s)]
*  That appears to be an indication that at least initially they want to talk about this diplomatically. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  I think if Israel wanted to respond militarily, they could have done so overnight in the darkness. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=281.8s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself has been fairly quiet today. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=291.8s)]
*  He put out just a single tweet in Hebrew basically saying, we stopped the attack and together [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=295.08s)]
*  we will win. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  He did not commit himself to any kind of large-scale military response, and we are expecting President [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=302.34s)]
*  Biden and other G7 leaders to meet today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=308.76s)]
*  So it looks like for now there is going to be a series of diplomatic meetings ahead, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  and there is nothing at this moment that indicates Israel is planning any kind of large-scale [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=319.24s)]
*  response. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=324.08s)]
*  Ralph Sanchez, excellent reporting. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=325.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, my friend. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=326.56s)]
*  Appreciate that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5j67XVgGI&t=327.4s)]
