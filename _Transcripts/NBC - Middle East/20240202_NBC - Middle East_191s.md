# Col. Jack Jacobs: Fallen soldiers in dignified transfer today ‘made the ultimate sacrifice’
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c)
*  I also want to bring in our MSNBC military analyst and Medal of Honor recipient, Colonel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=0.0s)]
*  Jack Jacobs. I want to just say a little bit about the three people who lost their lives in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=4.88s)]
*  service of our country. Sergeant William Jerome Rivers, he is 46 years old. They are going to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=9.68s)]
*  add their name to the Wall of Fallen Heroes at the Carroll County Veterans Memorial Park. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=16.8s)]
*  Sergeant Kennedy Sanders was just 24 years old. She was so proud to be in the military [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=22.96s)]
*  that she went in uniform to visit schools and talk to students there. And she was close friends, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=29.44s)]
*  we are told, with Sergeant Brianna Moffat, 23 years old. They spent a lot of time together. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=35.36s)]
*  The Bonds, it's just not a band of brothers anymore, right? Everyone becomes very close [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=44.0s)]
*  when you are in service in this way. They were hoping to come home together this summer and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  attend a Nicki Minaj concert. Instead, they are coming home in this dignified transfer. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=54.32s)]
*  Tell us about the importance of seeing this, of understanding that there are, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=61.12s)]
*  all across the world, people who are willing to put their lives at risk [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  for our democracy, for our freedoms. Yeah, that's a very good point. We forget about that, you know. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=73.68s)]
*  Real people with lives and families. You know, back in the Second World War, everybody served. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=78.48s)]
*  We had something like 19 or 20 million people in uniform. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=84.08s)]
*  And then, after Vietnam, we decided that we were going to outsource the defense of the country [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=90.24s)]
*  to a very small number of young men and women who were willing to do it, because we didn't have the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=95.76s)]
*  political will to have a draft. And we attracted large numbers of kids who were willing to give [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=99.76s)]
*  up whatever they were going to do to join the military and put on the uniform, and for a wide [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=106.24s)]
*  variety of reasons, decide that they were going to defend the republic. Statistically, most Americans [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=114.0s)]
*  do not know anybody in uniform, because we don't have universal service. And as a result, we forget [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=120.72s)]
*  about them. We forget that there are kids, and even if you're, as far as I'm concerned, even if [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=128.0s)]
*  you're 46, you're a kid, there are kids who are out there right now, all across the world, defending [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=133.52s)]
*  us, the United States, our interests and the interests of our allies, and we forget about them [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=140.56s)]
*  because we don't know them. And it's only in circumstances like this, when they will have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  given, made the ultimate sacrifice, when they've given of themselves for our interests, that we [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  pay attention to them. And it's really, really important that we see this and see the results [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=160.24s)]
*  of their decision and of our decisions here back at home, Chris. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmCjALx0k_c&t=166.16s)]
