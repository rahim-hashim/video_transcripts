# 'They are the experts': Initial intel report counters Trump's big Iran claims
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU)
*  It is day 156 of the second Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, NBC News is reporting. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=3.84s)]
*  An initial assessment by U.S. intelligence concluded that President Trump's strikes on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=6.28s)]
*  Iran only set back the country's nuclear program by months, as opposed to Trump's claims that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=11.68s)]
*  it was obliterated. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=17.64s)]
*  The White House is already pushing back, calling the assessment flat out wrong. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=18.64s)]
*  My colleague Kelly O'Donnell has all these details. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=23.16s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=25.88s)]
*  Tonight, President Trump in the Netherlands for the NATO summit wielding a diplomatic [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=27.84s)]
*  win on the world stage, with the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran still holding. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=32.04s)]
*  The ceasefire is very much in effect, and I think we're going to keep it there for a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=37.96s)]
*  long time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=42.12s)]
*  The president projected more confidence that the U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=43.12s)]
*  sites, which included B-2 bombers, 14 bunker buster bombs, delivered a fateful blow. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=47.8s)]
*  Photos before and after appear to show significant destruction at the sites. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=54.76s)]
*  However, in a new development tonight, a preliminary assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=59.08s)]
*  estimates that the Iranian nuclear program has been delayed by three to six months, according [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=64.48s)]
*  to three people with knowledge of the report. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=70.68s)]
*  The White House disputes that initial assessment, calling it flat out wrong. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  Iran will never rebuild its nuclear. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  From there, absolutely not. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=79.36s)]
*  That place is under rock. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=81.4s)]
*  That place is demolished. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=83.12s)]
*  The B-2 pilots did their job. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=84.84s)]
*  And this tonight from the director of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=87.2s)]
*  What we see is a very important degree of damage. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  The Iranian nuclear program has been set back significantly. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=93.68s)]
*  Still, his all-cap style of diplomacy understressed tonight. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=97.48s)]
*  The red carpet European welcome, quite a contrast to the blunt and profane way he left Washington [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=102.4s)]
*  today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=109.0s)]
*  Curious over additional strikes by both Israel and Iran after he outlined his ceasefire plan. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=110.08s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=115.8s)]
*  don't know what the f*** they're doing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=121.56s)]
*  In flight on Air Force One, he recounted a tense call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=123.72s)]
*  There was going to be a retaliation this morning. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=129.0s)]
*  Behind the scenes, a senior White House official says the president over the past 48 hours [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=132.0s)]
*  had called Netanyahu with a clear demand. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=145.4s)]
*  No more war. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=148.52s)]
*  Then a trio of top officials, Vance, Rubio and Witkoff, were directed to reach out to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=149.52s)]
*  Iran to deliver the message that a ceasefire was expected. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=155.36s)]
*  We got a lot to cover tonight, so let's get smarter with the help of our leadoff panel [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=161.32s)]
*  this evening. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=164.56s)]
*  Jeff Mason joins us. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=165.56s)]
*  White House correspondent for Reuters, Kara Lenig. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=166.56s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter with the Washington Post, Lieutenant General [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  Mark Hurtling, retired commander of the U.S. Army in Europe and former Republican Congressman [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=173.12s)]
*  David Jolly. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=177.84s)]
*  He is running for Florida governor. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=178.84s)]
*  Wait for it, as a Democrat. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  All right, General, let's start with you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  This early U.S. intelligence reportedly found the strikes only sealed off entrances to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=184.84s)]
*  the facilities but did not collapse them and much of the near bomb grade uranium was already [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=191.0s)]
*  taken out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=196.88s)]
*  What is your reaction to all of this? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=197.88s)]
*  It's an early assessment, Stephanie, first of all. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=200.76s)]
*  Secondly, it's conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, that agency is not as sexy as the CIA. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=206.32s)]
*  Not many people know what they do, but they are the experts primarily at a bunch of things [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=209.52s)]
*  one of which is bomb damage assessment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=214.9s)]
*  They use different kinds of ints, the intelligence systems. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=217.14s)]
*  They use imagery intelligence coming from satellites, from overhead platforms. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=220.82s)]
*  They use signals intelligence that captures communications both before and after a strike [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=225.62s)]
*  from the area. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=230.98s)]
*  And it basically allows you to determine what's going on at the place. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=231.98s)]
*  They use something called MAZINT, measurement and signals intelligence, which can detect [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=236.82s)]
*  chemical, radiological and physical changes to the surface. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=241.9s)]
*  They have human intelligence that falls in on this, reports from the ground, agents on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=245.94s)]
*  the ground, people who are reporting back to the defense headquarters. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  They use open source intelligence using Twitter feeds and all kinds of social media to go [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=255.34s)]
*  bouncing back and forth to determine what's real and what's not. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=260.78s)]
*  And finally, they use cyber intelligence. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=264.7s)]
*  And that confirms or denies the use of command and control assets. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=267.18s)]
*  So this has a lot of substance to it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=272.46s)]
*  It's a low confidence in the early report, but it is an early report. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=276.98s)]
*  And as many of us in the military have been saying the last couple of days, when the president [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=281.54s)]
*  said obliterated, it was way too early to say that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=285.42s)]
*  We were much more confident when General Cain the next day said, we're waiting and seeing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=288.82s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=293.94s)]
*  All of those things are important and you can't judge. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=295.38s)]
*  Yeah, the first reports are always wrong, always to the military guys. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=298.61999999999995s)]
*  So you got to wait for a little bit more information before you start proclaiming victory. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, let's assume this report is near correct or mostly correct. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  How far are we basically going to be in the same place we were, we are with Iran six months [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=314.82s)]
*  from now, if it only sets them back a few months in their nuclear development plans? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  Could be. But what I suggest is what's going to happen over the next couple of days in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  weeks are going to be important because it changes the dynamics. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  If the nuclear capability is still there and President Trump is declaring a ceasefire between [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  the two nations, this is not going to please Israel all that much. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=339.9s)]
*  They're going to continue to strike because their mission was to destroy the nuclear capabilities [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=343.34s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=348.34s)]
*  Iran is going to probably have a whole lot of pressure on saying, hey, we've just been [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=349.34s)]
*  bobbed into oblivion and it didn't strike anything and we still have the capability [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=353.82000000000005s)]
*  to produce. So let's hurry up and get one quick. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  So all of those things play into a part, a bunch of what ifs that military planners, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=361.62s)]
*  defense planners, government planners have to take into account. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=367.26000000000005s)]
*  And it changes the dynamic of the situation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=370.42s)]
*  This is where prior to the strike, red teaming would have been a whole lot better off to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  predict the kinds of dynamics that would occur if you don't get the effects that you're [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=376.98s)]
*  looking for in these bombing runs. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=382.66s)]
*  Jeff, you are in the Netherlands covering President Trump at the NATO summit. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=384.66s)]
*  We know his inner circle here is already pushing back on this intelligence assessment, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=388.86s)]
*  but the assessment is from the Pentagon. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=394.38000000000005s)]
*  Right. How is that going to go over with the exception of I'm sure the White House is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  mad at them? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=401.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'm anticipating that it's not going to go over well. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=404.62s)]
*  The president is scheduled to do a press conference later in the day. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=407.3s)]
*  It's the next day here in the Netherlands today after meeting with NATO leaders. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=411.78s)]
*  And no doubt this is one of the top questions that will come up. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=418.38s)]
*  He expressed a great deal of dissatisfaction from the White House. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  And that was in Kelly's report earlier with the media and with news networks for casting [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  doubt on the success of the strike when he was talking about that just as he was departing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=432.97999999999996s)]
*  the White House for NATO. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=439.73999999999995s)]
*  And so I'm sure that he will be dissatisfied. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=441.62s)]
*  There's probably a polite way of saying that he will express that again with regard to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=445.42s)]
*  this report in general. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=450.26s)]
*  Look, the president is a all caps. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=452.98s)]
*  I loved how Kelly said that person and his initial response is always going to say or [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=455.5s)]
*  to be one of taking full credit and often exaggerating the success of whether it's a [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=462.58s)]
*  military mission or whether it's something else that he has gotten behind. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=470.1s)]
*  That is harder to do when it's something that has intelligence or actual evidence of the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=475.06s)]
*  rate of success that you're talking about. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=485.22s)]
*  And now, you know, within days of the strike, which the president portrayed, as we've been [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=487.22s)]
*  saying, as a major success, we're getting more intelligence and more information about [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=493.34000000000003s)]
*  what actually happened and the impact that it has. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=498.34s)]
*  I also spoke to an analyst this week who before this report came out, said the question [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=501.09999999999997s)]
*  remains whether or not whether this strike will deter Iran or lead it to even double [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=506.53999999999996s)]
*  down in terms of pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapon and whether or not this bombing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=513.3s)]
*  helped or hindered that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=521.5799999999999s)]
*  So this is just one more piece in the puzzle of kind of raising the question of whether [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=523.2199999999999s)]
*  the strike was successful in pursuing U.S. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=529.4599999999999s)]
*  aims or not. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=532.26s)]
*  Carol, you have covered the president's relationship with the Intel community. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=533.62s)]
*  It wasn't good. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=538.06s)]
*  But after this, I'm guessing it's going to be significantly worse. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=539.38s)]
*  It's such a critical point about this president, both in Trump point, you know, one point [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=546.02s)]
*  and Trump two point. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  Oh, he distrusted intelligence officials from the get go when he got into the presidency [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=552.1s)]
*  the first time around. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=558.02s)]
*  And now he's just openly rejecting that intelligence, which doesn't match his political [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=559.42s)]
*  talking points. I mean, Jeff is so right that this is a president who wants always to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=565.98s)]
*  project strength and to score. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=571.22s)]
*  I'm trying to think of all the hyperbolic words I could think of about how he wants to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=575.62s)]
*  basically have a touchdown every single time he makes a move. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=580.26s)]
*  And there is where you get the word obliterated. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=584.9399999999999s)]
*  But keep in mind, Steph, on intelligence, the question you asked, Tulsi Gabbard came [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=587.74s)]
*  out with a statement before all of this happened in her testimony in which she said that it [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=593.1s)]
*  was a real question about whether Iran was able to produce a weapons grade nuclear bomb [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=600.06s)]
*  in any kind of near term. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=607.06s)]
*  And Donald Trump rejected that because he was already on the path, along with Hawks in [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=609.3399999999999s)]
*  the Pentagon and along with Benjamin Netanyahu's strong encouragement to execute a [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=615.06s)]
*  strike. And so intelligence is less and less important to Donald Trump. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=622.38s)]
*  And optics are really critical. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=627.58s)]
*  The problem is you need good intelligence to make good decisions, not just for tomorrow [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=629.66s)]
*  or the next day, but for the security of the country for months and years to come. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUy23KGh-YU&t=634.98s)]
