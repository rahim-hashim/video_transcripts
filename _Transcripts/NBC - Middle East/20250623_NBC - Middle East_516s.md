Video Description: Rachel Maddow reviews the cast of characters that staff important national security roles in the Trump administration, and whose lack of qualifications for their jobs matters even more now that Donald Trump's bombing of Iran has raised the threat level for Americans everywhere in the world.

# Trump's poor choices for national security staffing have new relevance after Iran bombing
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc)
*  We, the American people, have a couple of situations at hand, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=0.0s)]
*  First of all, we've got this person as director of national intelligence and everything that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=4.48s)]
*  means. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=8.76s)]
*  Less than two weeks ago, for instance, it meant that our director of national intelligence [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=9.76s)]
*  posted a bizarre video online in which she said that the, quote, political elite and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  warmongers are actively right now trying to bring about nuclear war on earth. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=20.12s)]
*  Quote, perhaps it's because... [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=26.12s)]
*  This is what she said. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=28.8s)]
*  Perhaps it's because they are confident that they will have access to nuclear shelters [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=29.8s)]
*  for themselves and for their families that regular people won't have access to. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=34.84s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=43.36s)]
*  I mean, to be clear, this is not the YouTube comment section I'm reading on an InfoWars [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=45.88s)]
*  post. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=50.96s)]
*  This is the director of national intelligence for the United States government in what appears [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=51.96s)]
*  to be some sort of official straight-to-camera video proclamation basically telling the American [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=57.16s)]
*  people that there are secret, impenetrable nuclear shelters just for the elite, just [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=63.44s)]
*  for the warmongers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=69.36s)]
*  And because of that, they are... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=71.16s)]
*  Well, the warmongers and their families. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  And so the warmongers and the elite are planning a nuclear war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=75.84s)]
*  They are planning to deliberately destroy the earth with nuclear war so they can rule [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=79.8s)]
*  the rubble from their secret, impenetrable underground cities. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=84.56s)]
*  Or something. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=90.44s)]
*  That is the director of national intelligence for a country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  For our country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=98.28s)]
*  Which is a country that just bombed Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=101.4s)]
*  After President Donald Trump said he didn't care what U.S. intelligence said about Iran, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=106.36s)]
*  he knew, he knew somehow from mysterious other sources. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  He knew that Iran was on the brink of a nuclear weapon and therefore we had to bomb them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  Now tonight he says there will be a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=121.56s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister just moments ago said on social media that there is no ceasefire [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  agreement. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=131.08s)]
*  But that if Israel stops attacking Iran, Iran will stop responding. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Quote, the final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=136.8s)]
*  So we don't exactly know what that means. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=143.84s)]
*  We will see. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  But here in the United States, this follows a new national terrorism advisory alert from [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=148.28s)]
*  our government's Department of Homeland Security, which advises that Trump's decision to bomb [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=155.52s)]
*  Iran, quote, could contribute to U.S.-based individuals plotting violent attacks here [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=159.8s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=165.12s)]
*  So again, if you're the U.S. government, think about what you're going to do to respond [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  to circumstances like this, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  How do you prepare us as a country? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=176.6s)]
*  How might you harden our defenses or try to avert any such attack, which our government, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  again, is now warning about? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=184.68s)]
*  Well, again, it depends on who is running the U.S. government. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=186.56s)]
*  And in the case of President Donald Trump, the way he has been preparing the government [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  for this eventuality is by forcing out the head of the National Security Branch at the FBI. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=194.08s)]
*  Don't worry, though, there's also a National Security Division at the Department of Justice. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, Trump demoted the acting head of the National Security Division at the Department [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  of Justice, apparently because that acting chief didn't move quickly enough after the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=209.68s)]
*  inauguration to take down the picture of President Biden and put up the picture of President Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=215.68s)]
*  And so he was demoted out of that job. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  That said, the FBI also has its own specific counterterrorism division. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=225.16s)]
*  He appears to have been pushed out. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  He left the FBI last month. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=231.36s)]
*  Ah, but don't worry, there is at least one senior counterterrorism position in the United [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  States government that has been definitively and deliberately filled by this president. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=238.44s)]
*  It's at the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=244.6s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security's domestic counterterrorism hub leads nationwide efforts [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=247.12s)]
*  to prevent targeted acts of violence of all kinds. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=252.56s)]
*  President Donald Trump, in his infinite wisdom, has put this man in charge of that at Homeland [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=256.12s)]
*  Security. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  Feast your eyes. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=262.68s)]
*  He's 22 years old, one year out of college with no evident national security experience [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=263.88s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=269.68s)]
*  Before volunteering for the Trump campaign, his LinkedIn page reportedly explains that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=270.8s)]
*  his work experience includes, quote, long care work around my neighborhood. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=275.36s)]
*  Also, working part time as a clerk at an H.E.B. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=280.44s)]
*  supermarket. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  He also apparently once had an internship at the Heritage Foundation, an internship. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=284.92s)]
*  And according to a recent ProPublica profile of this young man, again, who is Donald Trump's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=290.56s)]
*  best guess at who would make a good counterterrorism chief for the United States government at [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  this moment in time, according to ProPublica, quote, the bulk of his leadership experience [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=300.56s)]
*  comes from having served as secretary general of a model United Nations club in school. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  But now that is who Donald Trump has running domestic counterterrorism efforts for the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=315.92s)]
*  U.S. government, for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=322.0s)]
*  I feel duty bound to inform you that the left eyebrow is itself registered as a lethal [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=325.8s)]
*  weapon. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=330.92s)]
*  So underestimate him at your peril, ladies. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=332.12s)]
*  In April, there was an arson attack targeting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and his [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=338.6s)]
*  family at the governor's mansion in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=344.36s)]
*  Four days later, a self-proclaimed white supremacist shot up the campus of Florida State University, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=348.0s)]
*  including six people and killing two. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=354.64s)]
*  ProPublica notes that he used a picture of Hitler as the profile picture for his online [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=356.88s)]
*  accounts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=361.52s)]
*  In May, there was a car bombing of a fertility clinic in California for somebody who ascribes [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=362.52s)]
*  to some sort of anti-natalist bizarre extremist ideology. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=368.08s)]
*  In late May, two employees of the Israeli embassy were murdered in Washington, D.C. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=373.44s)]
*  In June, an event in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza was the target of a bizarre firebombing [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=380.48s)]
*  attack in Colorado in which 12 people were injured. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=386.56s)]
*  Last weekend, one Minnesota Democratic leader and her husband were assassinated. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=390.88s)]
*  Another Minnesota Democratic legislator was shot nine times and has thus far survived. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=396.12s)]
*  His wife was shot eight times. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=402.12s)]
*  She has just miraculously been released from the hospital. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=404.52s)]
*  So it's not like domestic counterterrorism is a niche concern in America right now. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=408.76s)]
*  Even before the new and explicit warning about potential revenge inside this country for [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=416.08s)]
*  Trump's decision to bomb Iran. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=421.68s)]
*  But from the office of the director of national intelligence, where the director is off the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=426.08s)]
*  quiet skies air marshal list herself now and Trump has thrown out that whole program for [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=430.84s)]
*  the whole country because who cares about that stuff? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=436.04s)]
*  Where they are now unleashed at the office of the director of national intelligence so [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=438.84s)]
*  the office can be on full alert for the lizard people to move their power centers into the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=443.36s)]
*  secret underground cities. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=447.92s)]
*  From the DNI to the decimation of the Justice Department and particularly the FBI, which [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=450.72s)]
*  is now led at the director and deputy director level by two right-wing podcasters, to the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=457.32s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security where a long boy and model UN kid has been appointed to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=463.44s)]
*  lead counterterrorism in every element of its responsibility to keep the American people [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=469.44s)]
*  safe. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=474.84s)]
*  The US government under Donald Trump is, I guess, doing the best they're capable of. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=477.79999999999995s)]
*  This is the best they can do. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=485.23999999999995s)]
*  This is your government under Trump Republican leadership, working to keep you safe. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDyat4dOUvc&t=490.04s)]
