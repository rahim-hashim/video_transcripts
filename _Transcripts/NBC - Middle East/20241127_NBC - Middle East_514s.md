# ‘This Lebanon deal is a key moment’ to get a hostage deal in Gaza: Mideast Envoy Hochstein
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA)
*  The U.S. brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah ends the deadliest war in decades [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=0.0s)]
*  between the two sides. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=4.76s)]
*  The deal is fragile, nearly a year in the making after painstaking negotiations that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=6.42s)]
*  intensified in just the last two months. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=10.92s)]
*  Joining us now is the lead U.S. negotiator for the deal, U.S. envoy Amos Hoekstein. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=13.76s)]
*  Amos, congratulations for now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Fingers crossed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=22.16s)]
*  Fingers and toes crossed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=23.16s)]
*  This is Lebanon. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=24.78s)]
*  It's the Middle East. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=25.78s)]
*  You know it better than anyone. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=26.78s)]
*  But you have been shuttling back and forth between Beirut and Jerusalem and other capitals [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=28.28s)]
*  for a long time to make this happen. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=33.04s)]
*  What do you think was the key breakthrough? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=34.64s)]
*  I think this has been a very difficult year, right? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=38.08s)]
*  So this, Hezbollah joined in, for those who don't remember, Hezbollah joined in this conflict [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  within hours of Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  So 2, 3 a.m. on October 8th, they started that front. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=49.34s)]
*  So we've been in a two front war ever since and been devastating. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=53.44s)]
*  Over the last couple of months, we felt that there was enough. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=57.68s)]
*  Israel has degraded Hezbollah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=61.8s)]
*  It achieved a lot on the battlefield against Hezbollah, eliminated most of its leaders [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=63.2s)]
*  and taken out a lot of its capabilities. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=68.6s)]
*  And on the other hand, there was a, you're not going to get security in Israel or in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=71.76s)]
*  Lebanon with only military options. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=76.28s)]
*  And so if you want to get people back to their homes and repair their lives in Israel, you [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=80.52s)]
*  have to get to a political deal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  So I felt that there was a moment in time that we reached that was the right moment [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=86.96s)]
*  to press hard to get there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=91.8s)]
*  And that's where we intensified the negotiations over, I would say, the last six weeks with [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=94.0s)]
*  a lot of active support from the president to be able to get to the decision yesterday. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=98.52s)]
*  Was it a hard decision to try to get Hezbollah off of demanding a ceasefire, a full ceasefire [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=103.32s)]
*  by their Iranian allies, proxies, Hamas, to get that first, which was proving to be so [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=111.24s)]
*  intractable? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  So yeah, that was one of the key problems was Hezbollah for Nasrallah, the now deceased [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  leader of Hezbollah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=126.56s)]
*  Well, assassinated by the Israelis and so forth. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=127.56s)]
*  He kept saying there will never be, an Iranian official said it too, there will never be [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=131.04s)]
*  a ceasefire in Lebanon without a ceasefire in Gaza, which meant that he was, look, the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=136.62s)]
*  Lebanese people actually never wanted this conflict. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=142.94s)]
*  They didn't ask for it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=146.34s)]
*  Hezbollah forced it on them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=147.34s)]
*  And the majority of Lebanese never wanted this war. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=148.7s)]
*  So tying it to a intractable other conflict didn't make a lot of sense. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  And breaking the linkage was critically important. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=157.7s)]
*  And that paved the way to this deal here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=161.66s)]
*  But this is a very complicated deal. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  People are saying it's a 60-day deal. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=167.1s)]
*  It is not a 60-day deal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  It is a permanent ceasefire with a 60-day deployment plan for the Lebanese army to take [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=169.82s)]
*  over its territory and the Israelis to depart. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=176.42s)]
*  How challenging is it going to be for the Lebanese army to stand up? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=180.42s)]
*  And it's really the first step towards Lebanon reestablishing its sovereignty, because Hezbollah [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=184.38s)]
*  has so permeated Lebanon politically, economically, and militarily. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, Andrea, you think about the fact that, in 1975, we had a civil war in Lebanon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=194.22s)]
*  We've had Israeli invaders, Syrian invaders, Iranian invaders through Hezbollah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=199.9s)]
*  The Lebanese army has not been in full control of its own territory in decades. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=205.82s)]
*  This is the moment of opportunity for Lebanon to have, the Lebanese people, to have sovereignty [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=210.74s)]
*  over their country from foreign invaders as well as internal, and to rebuild their country. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=215.9s)]
*  But as you just said, the Lebanese army is not equipped to go in on day one and to have [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=223.14s)]
*  a massive force that it needs to accomplish. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=228.38s)]
*  How are they going to get equipped? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  So we're going to support them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=233.54s)]
*  We have a 60-day plan for them to be able to deploy. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=235.7s)]
*  And as they deploy, the Israelis withdraw. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=238.45999999999998s)]
*  So within the first several days, the Israelis will start withdrawing from the areas that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=241.06s)]
*  the Lebanese army will go in. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=245.42s)]
*  And we are going to provide, together with our international partners, support, financial [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=247.34s)]
*  training, equipment, and the particular training for doing this kind of a job. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  2006, the war ended. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=258.1s)]
*  And the mediators left and didn't return from that day on. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=260.5s)]
*  And so there was zero implementation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=266.06s)]
*  We were determined not to make that mistake again. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=268.62s)]
*  So we're going to have implementation here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  We're going to pay attention to what happens on the ground and not allow Hezbollah or other [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=272.82s)]
*  organizations to reestablish terrorist infrastructure. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=276.58s)]
*  One of the ways Hezbollah won the support of some of the Lebanese people is by helping [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=280.26000000000005s)]
*  them rebuild after the last Israeli occupation and providing food and other services, schools. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  How do you prevent that from happening again? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, that's exactly my point. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  We reached a deal in 2006 to end the war. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  The mediators just left. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  They didn't implement the agreement, and they didn't support those whose homes were destroyed, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=300.44000000000005s)]
*  mostly people who actually didn't participate in the war, but their homes were destroyed. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=305.22s)]
*  We have to do two things. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=309.08s)]
*  One, support the Lebanese army, and the second, support the Lebanese economy and the Lebanese [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=310.28s)]
*  people. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  That's the responsibility of the United States and the international community. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  And if we don't do it, we'll be back at this conflict in a few years. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=318.08s)]
*  And I was talking to Ruby Henn, a very strong advocate for the hostage families. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=321.28s)]
*  They feel abandoned and left behind in this, although congratulating the peace that is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=328.26s)]
*  going to be brought to Lebanon in the north and to the Israelis in the north, rather. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=336.16s)]
*  What hope is there for Gaza? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=340.92s)]
*  Look, I think this is actually, this Lebanon deal is a key moment to change. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  We're stuck in Gaza. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=349.12s)]
*  And Hamas has always believed, I have the support of Hezbollah and Iran supporting me, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=351.32000000000005s)]
*  distracting Israel into a two-front war and supporting. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=355.68s)]
*  They woke up this morning at 4 a.m. local time knowing they're alone. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=358.34000000000003s)]
*  And so I think that we believe, the president believes, and he said it yesterday, that this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  is the moment that we need to leverage that, to try to put whatever pressure we can to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=366.48s)]
*  get those hostages. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=371.44s)]
*  The president believes that he may be in a transition period, but getting the hostages [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=372.44s)]
*  home is something he's going to work on to the last. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  Hamas said that they're willing to negotiate now with Turkey, Qatar. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  We don't know who that is. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=383.36s)]
*  I mean, there were reports in Israel, but is there a spokesperson? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=384.36s)]
*  I mean, Israel has killed Sinema, they've killed Mohammed Deif. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, the president said yesterday quite openly that Hamas is not negotiated in good faith [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=391.56s)]
*  in months. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  If they want to come and negotiate in good faith, there is a deal to be made now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=398.44s)]
*  And the president also said, we are going to use this moment to go talk to Turkey, to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=402.08s)]
*  work with Turkey, with Qatar, with Egypt, with anybody else who can help to get this [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=406.67999999999995s)]
*  deal done. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=410.88s)]
*  I believe it is possible and that this Lebanon deal now is the moment that could break the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=411.88s)]
*  logjam that we were on. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=417.67999999999995s)]
*  Can the Trump people be helpful? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  Look, they weren't involved in this negotiation, but after the election, we have definitely [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=421.32s)]
*  briefed them. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=426.35999999999996s)]
*  I briefed them on this deal. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  I thought it was fair if we're going to make commitments on how this ends. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  They should know about it and support it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=432.68s)]
*  They've been supportive. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=434.24s)]
*  And I think that we are trying to make this a seamless—on the national security front, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  at least, it should be a seamless transition. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=440.91999999999996s)]
*  And if we can—if they can be helpful, I think that would be advisable. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=444.02s)]
*  The most important thing is to get these—look, people are—these hostages are sitting in [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klii22YBdlA&t=449.03999999999996s)]
