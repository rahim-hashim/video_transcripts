# U.S. and U.K. forces carry out retaliatory strikes in Yemen
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8)
*  We do have some other breaking news right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. officials tell NBC News U.S. and British forces are conducting more retaliatory strikes [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=3.24s)]
*  against Houthi rebels in Yemen tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Courtney Cubie joins us now with more details. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=11.48s)]
*  Courtney, what can you tell us? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=15.4s)]
*  Yeah, we're just starting to get some of those details in right now, Jonathan, literally [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=17.12s)]
*  moments ago. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=20.46s)]
*  We know that these strikes were against at least 18 different targets, Houthi targets, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=21.46s)]
*  at eight separate locations. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=26.76s)]
*  And they went after things like Houthi military capabilities. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=28.6s)]
*  Now, what might you may recall, I'm sure you both recall, that there have been a number [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=31.68s)]
*  of these coalition strikes, that's the U.S. and the British military together, conducting [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=36.44s)]
*  these airstrikes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=41.5s)]
*  There have been a number of these in the past several months. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=42.5s)]
*  What sets this one out a little bit is it seems that there was a little more emphasis [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=45.2s)]
*  on underground storage facilities. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=48.64s)]
*  So that is that the Houthis have been putting some of their missiles, some of their one-way [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=50.8s)]
*  attack drones, storing some of those parts underground to keep the U.S. from striking [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=57.16s)]
*  them in between these attacks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  And we've been hearing over the last several weeks, as the U.S. has been taking what they [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  call self-defense or more dynamic strikes against the Houthis pretty much on a daily [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  basis, we've been hearing that the Houthis have been adapting their tactics. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  So they will pop out from these underground facilities that will carry out a strike, whether [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=76.96s)]
*  it's an anti-ship ballistic missile or launch off a drone, and then they'll quickly retract [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=81.12s)]
*  back down. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=85.84s)]
*  The difference about these strikes is that so far what we're learning is that they are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=87.0s)]
*  going after more of these underground sites. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=90.28s)]
*  So again, trying to take out the Houthis' military capabilities so they can't continue [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=92.2s)]
*  to carry out attacks and target and threaten shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  We've seen a real uptick in those kinds of attacks just in recent days. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=102.16s)]
*  Jonathan and Jen. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97_Vpldl1J8&t=105.36000000000001s)]
