# Pentagon: U.S. Will Hold Taliban Accountable For Safe Passage Of Remaining Americans
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 31, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4)
*  Joining us now, Pentagon Press Secretary, retired Rear Admiral of the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=0.0s)]
*  Navy John Kirby. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=6.08s)]
*  Admiral Kirby, thanks for your time this morning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=7.08s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=9.72s)]
*  Do you have a sense this morning as you talk to people on the ground and you talk to people [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=10.92s)]
*  across the Defense Department about how many Americans remain in Afghanistan today? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=14.96s)]
*  I don't think there's an exact figure, Willie. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=20.48s)]
*  We believe we got the vast, vast majority of American citizens out, something to the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=22.78s)]
*  tune of 6,000 of them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=27.36s)]
*  And we think it's probably in the low hundreds that are still there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=29.72s)]
*  And there were also several hundred others that didn't want to leave. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  I know this is now a diplomatic mission, as you all have said, and this is for the State [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=38.56s)]
*  Department, but if those 200 or so Americans are going to be extracted from the country, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  it would make sense that there'd be some military effort behind it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=48.2s)]
*  Do you expect that you will have a role in getting those people out of the country? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=51.28s)]
*  Willie, right now, I think the tools we have available to us and that we're going to use [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  as a U.S. government is going to be more in the diplomatic, economic lanes, and we don't [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=58.96s)]
*  really see a military role right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=64.72s)]
*  So what does that look like? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=68.08s)]
*  How does diplomacy get those people out of the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=69.12s)]
*  It's not completely unlike the way we do it elsewhere around the world. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=74.08s)]
*  We have Americans that get stranded in countries all the time, and we do everything we can [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=77.36s)]
*  to try to facilitate safe passage. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  We have made it very clear what our expectations are to the Taliban, and if the Taliban want [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=85.16s)]
*  to govern, and they say they do, and if they want to not retaliate when they say they do, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  obviously we're going to hold them to their deeds, not just those words. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=94.36s)]
*  And so there are leverage tools we have available to us to hold them to account. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  But that's the effort. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  It's going to be a whole-of-government effort, but I really don't see a military role at [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  this time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  So President Biden, as you know, said in his interview with ABC News a couple of weeks [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=109.08s)]
*  ago that America would stay until every last American was out of the country. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  Was there any consideration of extending the deadline until you got Americans out, until [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  you got some of those wartime partners out? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, you heard the president himself say that he was willing to have the Pentagon come [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=124.44s)]
*  up with contingency plans in case we needed to go past the 31st, but you also saw, Willie, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=128.8s)]
*  in the last couple of days just how dangerous and perilous the environment was getting, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=133.96s)]
*  not just for our troops at the airport or the operations at the airport, but for local [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=138.56s)]
*  citizens near and around the airport. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=142.34s)]
*  I mean, there was a very incredible, very specific increasing threat stream by ISIS [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=144.32s)]
*  that was making the entire operation more perilous, and we had to make some decisions [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=150.52s)]
*  in the last couple of days to make sure that we could get everybody out as safely as possible [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=154.38s)]
*  and not imperil civilians any more than they already were. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=158.62s)]
*  With the last American troop now out of Afghanistan, as you look back on it now, would it have [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=163.1s)]
*  made sense to start these evacuations earlier so that you could hold to the August 31st [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=168.9s)]
*  deadline and still get everyone out of the country who wanted to leave the country? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  I think there'll be time to sort of do the forensics here, Willie, and see what might [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=178.74s)]
*  have been done differently, and those are fair questions. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=183.12s)]
*  We're asking ourselves the same questions as you might imagine, but what I can tell [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=186.14s)]
*  you is we went within 48 hours, we went from believing we had a capable long-time ally [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=189.4s)]
*  in the Ghani government and the Afghan forces to having to develop a pragmatic relationship [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=195.2s)]
*  with a long-time enemy, which was the Taliban, and things moved very, very quickly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  I will tell you that non-combatant evacuation operations was not something the Pentagon [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=206.2s)]
*  wasn't thinking of. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=210.68s)]
*  We had been thinking about this all the way back into the spring to the degree to which [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=211.68s)]
*  that we actually flowed forces into the theater off of ships to put them closer to Afghanistan [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=215.14s)]
*  so that if we had to do this, we could do it quickly. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=220.27999999999997s)]
*  It turned out within 48 hours we actually did have to do it, and that's why we were [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=222.73999999999998s)]
*  able to get 3,000 troops on the ground literally within two days and not only defend but secure [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=226.17999999999998s)]
*  and continue the operations of a major international airport. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  A lot of planning went into this, Willie, and we'll have time to do the forensics, but [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  we moved as fast as we could. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  We had Kristen Rouse on the show a few minutes ago. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  She served three tours in Afghanistan. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=243.52s)]
*  She's part of a group called Digital Dunkirk that's trying to get interpreters, people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=245.68s)]
*  they worked with, Afghans who put their lives on the line to fight alongside the United [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  States to try to get them out of the country, but hopes are dimming. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=254.72s)]
*  She's not quite sure how to get those people out now that the American military has gone. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=258.3s)]
*  What is your message to those Afghans whose lives are now in danger, quite literally moment [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=262.76s)]
*  to moment, who fought alongside us and believed that they had a commitment from the United [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=268.36s)]
*  States to help them get out when it was time? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  I would tell them, Willie, that they still have that commitment. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=275.56s)]
*  We thank them for their service. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  We're grateful for what they did, and we moved out an incredible number in a span of two [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  weeks, 123,000, the vast majority of which were Afghans, Afghan allies, people like them [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  who helped us. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=290.52s)]
*  As General McKenzie said yesterday, we're heartbroken that we couldn't get everybody [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  out, but they still have our commitment. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=295.28s)]
*  They still have the commitment of this administration and the United States, and we're going to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  do everything we can to continue to try to get them out of that country and out safely. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=300.4s)]
*  Admiral, what does that look like? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  I'll just use Kristen's example. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=308.96s)]
*  Her personal interpreter, someone who she considered family because of the work he did, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  and it's just one story among thousands in that country. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  What does that American commitment mean? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=318.12s)]
*  What does it look like? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=319.96s)]
*  What can you do? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=320.96s)]
*  We have tools available to us across the range of the levers of power of a government. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  We're going to use those tools to the maximum extent that we can, and we're going to hold [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=327.44s)]
*  the Taliban to what they've committed to, which is this safe passage of American citizens [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=331.8s)]
*  and our allies in Afghanistan to get out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=337.36s)]
*  We're going to hold them accountable to that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=340.68s)]
*  What does it feel like to you from the Department of Defense to put that level of faith in the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=343.64s)]
*  Taliban, the medieval cult that treats brutally women and children and anyone who was seen [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=349.64s)]
*  as working with America? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  There's nothing about faith here, Willie, nothing at all. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=358.18s)]
*  It's not about trust. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=360.58s)]
*  We developed a pragmatic relationship that we had to do over the last couple of weeks [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  to help get people safely to the airport and get them out of there, and it worked. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=366.18s)]
*  But believe me, nobody's resting on laurels here, and nobody's just going to take it at [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=370.5s)]
*  face value what the Taliban say. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=375.97999999999996s)]
*  We're going to hold them accountable for their actions, not just their words, their actions. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=378.14s)]
*  And again, we have tools available to us across the range of our government to do that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=382.54s)]
*  Admiral Mike Barnacles here with a question for you, Mike. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=386.98s)]
*  Admiral, your career, your life, and the building that you work in have been and are built on [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=391.94s)]
*  a core, a core that resounds throughout the military. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=399.42s)]
*  We leave no one behind. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=402.94s)]
*  What is the mood these past couple of days, what is the mood this morning in the E-ring [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=405.42s)]
*  of the Pentagon as people walk around knowing that thousands have been left behind? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=411.46000000000004s)]
*  And what is the relationship today between the Pentagon, the top brass in the Pentagon, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=417.14000000000004s)]
*  and the American State Department? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  I think we are grateful for the incredible teamwork we've had with the State Department [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  on the ground, certainly in Kabul over the last couple of weeks, but at large across [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=430.46000000000004s)]
*  the world. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=434.36s)]
*  I mean, it's a team effort, and it absolutely was. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=435.36s)]
*  Each of those gates at the airport, there were consular officers working side by side [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=437.42s)]
*  with Marines and with soldiers trying to do the best they can to process as many people [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=442.18s)]
*  as possible. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=447.38s)]
*  As for the mood here, look, we're grateful that we got everybody out safely yesterday. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=448.38s)]
*  That was no small feat, moving those last 800 troops out of the airport safely and efficiently [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=452.65999999999997s)]
*  with nobody getting hurt. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of relief in that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  But there's also, as you heard General McKenzie say, there's heartbreak. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=463.06s)]
*  Sure, we certainly would have liked and preferred to get more people out if we could, but the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=466.02s)]
*  time just wasn't there. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=471.41999999999996s)]
*  And I don't just mean the time on the clock. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=472.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean the time in terms of the threat. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=474.41999999999996s)]
*  And it was something we had to keep mindful all the time. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  You don't want to do anything that's not going to put your troops in danger, but also people [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=478.91999999999996s)]
*  around the airport and more civilians in danger. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=482.85999999999996s)]
*  So it was a tough decision, a tough couple of days, but we are re-energizing our commitment [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  to the entire government to continue to work to do what we can to help those that weren't [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=491.46s)]
*  able to make it out. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPcfZyaeS4&t=495.78s)]
