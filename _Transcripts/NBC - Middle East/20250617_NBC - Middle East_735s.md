# Trump becomes ‘center of the story of the G7’ following abrupt exit due to Israel-Iran conflict
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y)
*  Let's bring in NBC's Monica Alba from the White House, international correspondent Matt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Bradley from Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Also with us, PBS NewsHour coanchor Jeff Bennett and Victor Cha from the Center for Strategic [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=6.88s)]
*  and International Studies. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=12.64s)]
*  Thank you all for starting us off here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=14.68s)]
*  Monica, are any more details emerging about the president's decision to cut the G7 trip [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=16.8s)]
*  short and ready a situation room meeting? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=21.8s)]
*  Well, look, Ana, the official explanation was that he did need to return to Washington, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=24.28s)]
*  according to his top White House aides, to deal with very important matters specifically. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=28.72s)]
*  They later attributed that to, quote, what's going on in the Middle East. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=33.16s)]
*  But the president overnight, as he was returning, landing here just before 5 a.m., was asked [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=36.48s)]
*  by reporters to elaborate on that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=41.68s)]
*  And he said he couldn't really share more specific information, but that he wanted to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=43.4s)]
*  be monitoring it all, saying that Iran still had a chance to try to reach some kind of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=47.64s)]
*  a, quote, peaceful outcome, that that is what he's trying to still push for diplomatically [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  as challenging and difficult as that might be. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  But he didn't really offer more details on some of his other really significant comments [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=61.0s)]
*  and posts yesterday where he warned the entire city of Tehran, more than 10 million people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=65.72s)]
*  reside there to evacuate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=71.84s)]
*  And all he said about that was that he just wanted to make sure people were, quote, safe. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=74.36s)]
*  He also said, then refuted some reporting that's out there about the idea that he wanted [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=78.84s)]
*  to push for a complete ceasefire. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=84.28s)]
*  What he's saying again is that he's still trying to get the parties back to the table [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=86.84s)]
*  to discuss curbing Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=90.84s)]
*  But he was cagey on whether that meant he's going to send his vice president or his top [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=94.16s)]
*  envoy, Steve Wittkopf, to resume those conversations to meet with Iranian officials. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  So there's still a lot up in the air here on him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=104.0s)]
*  We don't even have a sense of a schedule for the president today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=106.56s)]
*  He did indicate he wanted to meet with his top national security advisors and officials [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=109.88s)]
*  here in the situation room. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=115.12s)]
*  So that's something that we could likely see in the coming hours. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=116.4s)]
*  But at this point, we don't have any other information about when we may see him or hear [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  from him next. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=122.48s)]
*  OK, so Matt, it is day five of this fight. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=123.48s)]
*  What more can you tell us about what's happening on the ground right now? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=125.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's been surprising last night. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=131.0s)]
*  I mean, it was quite a bit less terrifying than some of the previous nights when even [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=132.8s)]
*  inside these barricaded rooms that we see in almost every building in Israel, you could [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=136.72s)]
*  still hear impacts outside. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=141.8s)]
*  It was pretty frightening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  Last night, and we had three sirens, we went into these shelters and then we heard about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  after 10 or 15 minutes that it was OK to go. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=152.88s)]
*  And then according to the IDF today, last night was the latest Iranian assault on Israel [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=157.0s)]
*  since this all began with Israel's attacks against Iran on Friday morning. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=162.16s)]
*  So we even heard from the Ministry of Health here in Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  They said that 154 people came into the hospitals, but they were injured just trying to get to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  their safe rooms or they were experiencing anxiety. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=175.64s)]
*  So this was a very light night. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=179.44s)]
*  Now, whether or not this means that the Iranians are running out of steam, that's really hard [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  to say. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=184.6s)]
*  The Israelis have said that they've managed to eliminate about a third of Iran's ballistic [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  missile capability. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=190.55999999999997s)]
*  And it sounds like they're able to, as you mentioned, they enjoy total dominance in the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=192.11999999999998s)]
*  air over Tehran, the capital, and a lot of Western Iran. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  So it looks as though they have whatever targets they want. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=200.32s)]
*  This is according, of course, to the Israelis. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=203.76s)]
*  Now, we're still hearing about the death toll in Iran increasing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=205.96s)]
*  Now it's several hundreds, well more than 200 at this point, and that's probably likely [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=211.2s)]
*  to go up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=215.88s)]
*  Both sides seem as though we're not getting any closer to some sort of negotiated deal. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=217.2s)]
*  And Jeff, President Trump, you sparked a lot of questions and alarm, frankly, when he wrote [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=221.8s)]
*  that cryptic post last night saying everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=226.12s)]
*  This coming in the middle of the night for Iranian residents, here's how he explained [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=232.16s)]
*  it this morning. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  I want people to be safe. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's always possible. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  A thing like that could happen. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  I just want people to be safe. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  I just want people to be safe. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  Jeff, he seems to be sort of making a nothing burger of that ominous post. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  We're talking about millions of lives affected here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  How much do words matter, especially coming from the American president? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=257.2s)]
*  They matter immensely, Ana. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=261.56s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=263.56s)]
*  The president has offered a wide ranging at times conflicting set of options here, not [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=264.56s)]
*  just the truth social post advising people in Tehran, as Monica mentioned, a city of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=269.56s)]
*  more than 10 million people to evacuate immediately in that post giving no explanation as to why. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  But when speaking with reporters last night on Air Force One said that he didn't necessarily [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=280.36s)]
*  want a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=284.76s)]
*  What he wanted was an end to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=287.56s)]
*  And then he added walking away is an option too. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=290.76s)]
*  So the president, it's hard to get a read on where his head is right now, but I can [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=294.76s)]
*  tell you based on my reporting, the administration broadly believes that they want Israel to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=298.76s)]
*  continue this fight. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=303.76s)]
*  They believe that Israel has the air superiority, as Matt mentioned, that it has the intelligence [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=304.76s)]
*  dominance, that it has the personnel on the ground to continue degrading and debilitating [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=309.76s)]
*  Iran's ballistic missile system and its nuclear capability. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=314.76s)]
*  The question now is, will the U.S. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=317.96s)]
*  help Israel take out this site called Fordo? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=319.96s)]
*  This is a deeply buried nuclear site. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=322.96s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=325.96s)]
*  has the 30,000 pound bomb needed, ballistic bunker, ballistic missile that would take [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=326.96s)]
*  out that site. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=335.96s)]
*  Only the U.S. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=336.96s)]
*  has that bomb. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=337.96s)]
*  Israel does not. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=338.96s)]
*  But if the U.S. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=339.96s)]
*  were to engage in that way, it would bring U.S. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=340.96s)]
*  forces directly into this fight. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=343.96s)]
*  President Trump, as you well know, campaigned against having the U.S. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  get involved in foreign wars. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, now Israel v. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  Iran will certainly be a test of that pledge. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  Victor, there's the president leaving the G7 early. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  There's that post he put out last night. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  He's calling a meeting with his situation room team. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  How much of this is theatrics? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  It's hard to know. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  How much is actual urgency? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  We know he likes to keep his adversaries guessing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  But does it also make it harder for allies at the G7, for Israel to get involved? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  For Israel to work with the U.S. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=375.36s)]
*  or to game plan? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=377.36s)]
*  I certainly think in terms of the potential negotiations, he's basically using, I think, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=380.36s)]
*  Israel's coercive actions as a way to set the table for negotiations with Iran. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=387.36s)]
*  During the JCPOA, previous administrations used sanctions pressure to get Iran to the table. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=392.36s)]
*  And Trump is basically using Israel's coercive force to try to get a deal that goes beyond the JCPOA. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=399.56s)]
*  In terms of the G7, you know, the leaders, many of them saw a meeting with Trump as very important [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=405.56s)]
*  for Japan to try to get a trade deal, Canada as well. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=411.56s)]
*  Germany wants the U.S. to back more sanctions on Russia. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=414.56s)]
*  The U.K. did get their trade deal. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=418.56s)]
*  And then two leaders, Zelensky of Ukraine and the new president of South Korea, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=420.56s)]
*  wanted a meeting with Trump on the last day of the G7. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=426.76s)]
*  So none of that happens because he left early. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=429.76s)]
*  But it does become the story of the G7 summit, just like it was when he was last in Canada for the G7 in 2018, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=432.76s)]
*  where he left a day early also, that time for his summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=439.76s)]
*  you'll remember, Anna, in Singapore in 2018. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=444.76s)]
*  So whether he likes it or not, he becomes the center of the story of the G7, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=448.76s)]
*  whether he's there or whether he's not there. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=452.76s)]
*  And Monica, we've heard so many mixed messages on whether the U.S. and Iran are planning to reopen negotiations. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=454.96s)]
*  You touched on this earlier, but the president was asked about it this morning. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=460.96s)]
*  What more is he saying? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=463.96s)]
*  Yeah, and he actually is also taking this in a broader way to a fight that he's picking [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=464.96s)]
*  with French President Emmanuel Macron, saying that something he had said at the summit was incorrect [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=469.96s)]
*  when it comes to his desire to pursue a ceasefire. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=475.96s)]
*  Here's a little bit more of what the president had to say on Air Force One last night with reporters. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=478.96s)]
*  We're not looking for a ceasefire. I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=484.96s)]
*  That was Emmanuel, nice guy, but he hasn't got it right too often. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=487.96s)]
*  But we're looking for better than a ceasefire. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=492.96s)]
*  What specifically is better than a ceasefire? What are you looking for here? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=496.96s)]
*  An end, a real end, not a ceasefire, an end. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=501.96s)]
*  So something that will be permanent? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=504.96s)]
*  Yeah, or giving up entirely. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=506.96s)]
*  Is that OK, too? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=510.96s)]
*  And all the G7 leaders did end up signing a proclamation yesterday that condemned Iran [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=512.16s)]
*  as this source of regional instability and terror. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=519.16s)]
*  And remember, this was something where perhaps the president in the past has signaled he wouldn't sign on to something like that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=522.16s)]
*  It was an open question going into this, but he was attached to that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=528.16s)]
*  And then also, Ana, we should point out that he has said last night, just a few hours ago, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=531.16s)]
*  that he did believe that Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=536.16s)]
*  which is in contradiction to his own DNI director, Tulsi Gabbard, who had said differently. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=540.36s)]
*  And when he was asked specifically about that, he said, I don't care what she said. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=546.36s)]
*  I do believe they were very close. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=550.36s)]
*  So that's another fracture and dynamic and storyline we're watching here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=551.36s)]
*  So, Victor, let's talk about how Iran might be assessing the current situation. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=555.36s)]
*  Why would Iran agree to negotiate with the U.S. if they were already doing that and the result was to get attacked by America's ally? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=559.36s)]
*  Well, I think right now the pressure that Israel is putting on Iran in terms of all of the course of military activity is much deeper than economic sanctions, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=567.5600000000001s)]
*  things of that nature, which in the past was what brought Iran to the table for JCPOA. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  So I think when President Trump says that he's looking not for a ceasefire, but to an end of it all, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  I think he's referring both to the end of hostilities, but more importantly, to a complete verifiably and irreversible dismemberment, dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=590.76s)]
*  I think all the G7 leaders, Israel, the United States, are united on that particular point. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=602.76s)]
*  And it just so happens that for whatever intel they had, the Israelis believe that they need to take a preemptive military action now. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=607.76s)]
*  And the president will use that as a way to try to bring Iran to the table for serious negotiations on complete dismantlement. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=615.96s)]
*  He's already said he doesn't want to see enrichment in Iran, so not even a latent capability, let alone an actual weapons capability. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=623.96s)]
*  Jeff, let's zoom out. Bigger picture here. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=631.96s)]
*  Israel is now part of another escalating conflict, talks in Gaza's stall, talks with Iran, no guarantee. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=633.96s)]
*  And then you have a similar scenario playing out in Ukraine. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=639.96s)]
*  Deadly attacks escalating by both sides, talks stalled. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  President Trump promised to end big global wars, but they seem to be expanding. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=653.1600000000001s)]
*  It's when the campaign hits the reality of governing on it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=655.1600000000001s)]
*  And so even as President Trump espouses this America first ideology and he has people in his corner like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson advising him to let these other countries fight their own wars and keep the U.S. out. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=659.1600000000001s)]
*  The U.S. for generations has not always had that luxury. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=673.36s)]
*  I mean, that's the burden and blessing of being a world power. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=677.36s)]
*  And so the president, yes, he's having to face all of these many crises simultaneously, even with Israel fighting a war on three fronts. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=682.36s)]
*  I mean, Gaza, Hezbollah at one point, and now Iran. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=690.36s)]
*  But when it comes to the specific issue of a nuclear capable Iran, both the U.S. and Israel believe that an autocratic government like Iran having a nuclear weapon is an existential threat. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  And so the question now becomes to what degree will the U.S. involve itself in this fight to keep Iran's nuclear program from evolving even further? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM069EjJB6Y&t=724.36s)]
