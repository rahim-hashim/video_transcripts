# ‘At long last’: Biden speaks on Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ)
*  As at long last, I can announce a ceasefire and a hostage deal has been reached between Israel and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas. More than 15 months of conflict began with Hezbollah's brutal massacre on October the 7th. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=7.84s)]
*  More than 15 months of terror for the hostages, their families, the Israeli people. More than 15 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza. Fighting in Gaza will stop, and soon the hostages [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=23.28s)]
*  will return home to their families. The elements of this deal are what I laid out in detail this past [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=32.0s)]
*  May, which was embraced by countries around the world and endorsed overwhelmingly by the U.N. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=39.28s)]
*  Security Council. The deal is structured in three phases. Phase one will last six weeks. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=47.2s)]
*  It includes a full and complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=55.2s)]
*  populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including women, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=60.72s)]
*  and elderly, and the wounded. And I'm proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  in phase one as well. And the Vice President and I cannot wait to welcome them home. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=74.24s)]
*  In exchange, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. And during phase one, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=81.52s)]
*  the Palestinians can also return to their neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza. And the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=86.72s)]
*  surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza will begin. And the innocent people can have greater [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=92.8s)]
*  access to these vital supplies. You know, during the next six weeks, Israel will negotiate the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=99.52s)]
*  necessary arrangements to get phase two, which is a permanent end of the war. Let me say it again, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=106.56s)]
*  a permanent end of the war. There are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  phase two. But the plan says if negotiations take longer than six weeks, the ceasefire will continue [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  as long as the negotiations continue. I've spoken to the Emir of Kuwait and the President of Egypt, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=128.64s)]
*  and we have pledged to make sure the negotiations will keep moving forward for as long as it takes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=136.72s)]
*  Then, when phase two begins, there will be an exchange for release of the remaining living [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=144.08s)]
*  hostages, including male soldiers, and all remaining Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Gaza. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=151.12s)]
*  And a temporary ceasefire will become permanent. And finally, phase three, any final remains of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=157.76s)]
*  hostages who have been killed will be returned to their families. And a major reconstruction [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=166.24s)]
*  plan for Gaza will begin. This is the ceasefire agreement I introduced last spring. Today, Hamas [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=172.16s)]
*  and Israel have agreed to that ceasefire agreement and the whole ending of the war. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, those of you who have followed the negotiations can attest the road to this deal [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=188.56s)]
*  has not been easy. I've worked in foreign policy for decades. This is one of the toughest negotiations [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=193.36s)]
*  I've ever experienced. I've reached this point because of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  backed by the United States. Hamas's longtime leader, Sinwar, was killed. Hamas's strongest [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=207.27999999999997s)]
*  supporter, Iran, launched attacks on Israel. And those attacks failed after my administration [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=214.48s)]
*  organized a coalition of nations to stop them. And after I ordered the U.S. ships and planes [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=220.55999999999997s)]
*  to come to Israel's defense, we also shaped Israel's strong and calibrated response, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=226.48s)]
*  destroying Iran's air defenses, but avoiding an escalatory cycle of an all-out war. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=232.24s)]
*  The United States also organized a coalition of 20 countries to stand up to attacks by the Houthis, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  including their missile attacks on Israel. Then Hezbollah, another of Hamas's strongest backers, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=246.72s)]
*  was significantly weakened on the battlefield. And its leadership was destroyed with our support [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=255.36s)]
*  Israel negotiated a ceasefire with them. And after that, Lebanon finally elected a new president [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=262.0s)]
*  who's not beholding Hezbollah. And he can begin a new chapter for the Lebanese people. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=269.28s)]
*  All told, these developments in the region, which the United States helped to shape, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  changed the equation. And so now, the terror network that once protected and sustained Hamas [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=281.76s)]
*  is far weaker. Iran is weaker. Iran is weaker than it's been in decades. Hezbollah is badly [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=287.76s)]
*  degraded. And after more than 15 months of war, Hamas's senior leaders are dead. Thousands of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=295.12s)]
*  Hamas fighters are dead. And the military formations have been destroyed. With nowhere to turn, Hamas [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=302.56s)]
*  finally agreed to releasing hostages. You know, there was no other way for this war to end [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=310.64s)]
*  than with a hostage deal. And I'm deeply satisfied. This day has come, finally come, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=318.8s)]
*  for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=325.2s)]
*  the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=331.2s)]
*  The Palestinian people have gone through hell. Too many innocent people have died. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=337.04s)]
*  Too many communities have been destroyed. And this deal, the people of Gaza can finally recover [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  and rebuild. They can look to a future without Hamas in power. You know, the Bible says, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=350.0s)]
*  blessed are the peacemakers. Many peacemakers helped make this deal happen, including an [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  extraordinary team of American diplomats who have worked nonstop for months to get this done. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=363.6s)]
*  Secretary Blinken led the effort. Secretary Jake Sullivan, NASA Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=370.56s)]
*  Bill Burns, John Finer, Brett McGurk, Amos Hochstein, and the Vice President worked [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=378.0s)]
*  relentlessly as we worked to deliver this deal. I'd also note this deal was developed and negotiated [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=382.88s)]
*  under my administration, but its terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=392.24s)]
*  administration. In these past few days, we've been speaking as one team. This has been time of real [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=397.92s)]
*  turmoil in the Middle East. But as I prepare to leave office, our friends are strong, our enemies [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  are weak, and there's genuine opportunities for a new future. In Lebanon, there's an opportunity [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=412.72s)]
*  for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah. In Syria, a future free from the tyranny of Assad. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=419.6s)]
*  And for the Palestinian people, a credible, credible pathway to a state of their own. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  And for the region, a future of normalization and integration of Israel and all its Arab neighbors, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=433.12s)]
*  including Saudi Arabia. At the G20 in Delhi in September 23, I rallied key countries behind [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=439.68s)]
*  a vision of an economic corridor from India across the Middle East to Europe. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=447.84s)]
*  That vision can now become a reality. There are risks as well, including ISIS in Iran, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=453.28s)]
*  even in a badly weakened state. But, but, we're handing off to the next team a real opportunity [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  for a better future for the Middle East. I hope they will take it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  Let me close with this. My friend for years in the United States Senate, former Senator George [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=470.64s)]
*  Mitchell, who did so much to forge peace in Northern Ireland once said about diplomacy, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=476.4s)]
*  said it is a 700 days of failure and one day of success. 700 days of failure and one day of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=482.96s)]
*  success. Well, we've had many difficult days since the mosque began its terrible war. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  We've encountered roadblocks and setbacks. We've not given up. And now, after more than [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=495.76s)]
*  400 days of struggle, a day of success has arrived. God bless all the hostages and their families. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=502.72s)]
*  May God protect the troops of all those who work for peace. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you see the future of Gaza now? As you were saying, the implementation of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=515.52s)]
*  this deal will be in the hands of the next administration and basically, they will shape [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=520.88s)]
*  the future of Gaza. So how do you see this future? And also, how much credit do you give to the Trump [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=525.84s)]
*  team for this deal? Trump is a very taking credit for this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=532.32s)]
*  Well, you know, this is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May. Exact. And [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  and we got the world to endorse it. Secondly, it's America's support for Israel that helped them [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=546.1600000000001s)]
*  badly weaken the mosque and its backers and create the conditions for this deal. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=554.08s)]
*  And thirdly, I knew this deal would have to be implemented by the next team. So I told my team to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=559.68s)]
*  coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  because that's what American presidents do. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  How many Americans will be released when the hostages are being released? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=576.64s)]
*  All the exact detail of how many people are being held, how many bodies will be returned, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=586.8s)]
*  and less will all be forthcoming. All of it. All of it. Thank you. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=592.24s)]
*  I'm confident. Thank you. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=600.4s)]
*  Who is the books credit for this, Mr. President, you or Trump? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  Is that a joke? Oh, thank you. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=607.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navPwPFi5UQ&t=615.92s)]
