# Militant commander killed in U.S. drone strike in Baghdad
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ)
*  We have an update on the breaking news reported at the top of the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  In a statement released just moments ago, the U.S. military says that an airstrike by the U.S. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=3.92s)]
*  has killed a commander belonging to an Iranian-backed militia group [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  believed to be responsible for strikes against forces in the Middle East. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=12.8s)]
*  The U.S. military says that there are no indications of civilian casualties at this time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=16.8s)]
*  They add, quote, we will not hesitate to hold responsible all those who threaten our forces' safety. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=21.68s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=27.2s)]
*  Interbile Iraq and National Security and Global Affairs reporter Dan Deluse for us at the Pentagon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=30.96s)]
*  Dan, what more do we know? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=36.48s)]
*  Well, this is what they're calling a unilateral strike. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  The U.S. Central Command says that they have taken out the commander of Qahtab Hezbollah, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=42.24s)]
*  this Iranian-backed militia that has been blamed for many attacks, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=48.4s)]
*  dozens of attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=52.48s)]
*  And as you said, they believe at this point there were no civilian casualties or collateral damage. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=56.31999999999999s)]
*  And they, of course, say that they will continue to take these strikes as necessary to, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  as they say, protect our people, American service members. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=67.84s)]
*  Important to point out here that this campaign started on Friday [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  after three U.S. service members were killed and dozens of others were wounded in an attack [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=75.6s)]
*  at a U.S. outpost in Jordan. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=81.44s)]
*  And those retaliatory airstrikes targeted militias back by Iran in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  And then today they're saying they targeted and killed this commander of this Iranian-backed militia. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=90.24s)]
*  Dan, help me understand, though, is this part of the tiered attack? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=97.68s)]
*  Is this part of that ongoing campaign? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=101.36s)]
*  I think very much so, very much so. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  This is about holding accountable those who the U.S. believes have been conducting [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=106.32s)]
*  rocket and drone attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  And then, of course, there was that lethal attack that killed three American troops in Jordan. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  So this is part of this reprisal campaign, which is continuing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  And of course, they're trying to calibrate it so that they do not trigger some wider conflict. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  The strikes so far have not been conducted or targeted anything inside Iran. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=134.0s)]
*  They're going after these proxy networks that the U.S. says are armed and trained and financed by Iran. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=139.84s)]
*  Kier, what more can you tell us from Iraq, from Syria? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=146.56s)]
*  Well, at least here in Baghdad, the first we heard was of this explosion, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  a car on fire in eastern Baghdad. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=157.12s)]
*  It's in a mixed neighborhood, Sunni, Shia, Christian. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=159.28s)]
*  But as Dan was reporting there, it looks like this hit a vehicle that was carrying [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=163.76s)]
*  members of Qatab Hezbollah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=170.08s)]
*  Now, one of those killed is Abu Bakr al-Assadi. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=172.32s)]
*  And he is a leader of that group, as far as we can see. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=176.64s)]
*  This is being reported on telegram channels. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  We have to get confirmation from the U.S. that, if you like, they hit who they intended to hit. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  But it does appear as if what has happened here is that the U.S. has specifically targeted and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=190.64s)]
*  assassinated a member of a group that they believe is responsible for that attack on Tower 22. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  And just to add to what Dan was reporting there in terms of what CENTCOM is saying, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=203.2s)]
*  what we're being told by people, eyewitnesses, people in Baghdad who are talking to eyewitnesses, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  is that it does look as if it hit specifically this car. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  And even a car right next door didn't sustain damage. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  Now, that's not to say, even if there weren't any civilian casualties, that there isn't a huge [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  amount of anger, crowds around shouting no to America, no to Israel, as ambulances took [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=225.6s)]
*  these bodies away. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  Some reports that three people were killed in this vehicle. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=233.44s)]
*  I don't have confirmation of that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=236.72s)]
*  But that's being reported. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=238.0s)]
*  Obviously, in this opening hour, after something like this has happened, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  a lot is being reported that we can't necessarily confirm. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=243.6s)]
*  But it does look as if this has been a specific target on a specific member of this group [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  that the U.S. accuses of carrying out this attack on Tower 22, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  where those three servicemen and women were killed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=259.28s)]
*  Dan, what more can you tell us about Gataib Hezbollah and or this senior military commander? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=261.68s)]
*  The commander... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=269.84s)]
*  When this group is won... [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=271.52s)]
*  ...I'm sorry. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=271.92s)]
*  No, go down. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=274.8s)]
*  Fire away. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=277.12s)]
*  Keir, let's start with you and then we'll bounce over to Dan. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=279.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=283.68s)]
*  I mean, you know, this group is one of many, Iranian backed militia. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  It is under an umbrella group here in Iraq. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  And it has been... [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  These groups have been continuing to carry out attacks on bases sporadically, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=297.76s)]
*  even since that U.S., those U.S. strikes on now just last Friday. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  So this, you know, this is one of many groups that are backed by the Iranians. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=309.68s)]
*  They have some autonomy, but ultimately the U.S. clearly holding them responsible [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=315.76s)]
*  for what happened at Tower 22. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=322.0s)]
*  Dan, what more can you add? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=323.76s)]
*  No, I think the problem is here, the challenge is going to be, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=326.08s)]
*  does this actually deter and halt these attacks from these Iranian backed groups? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=329.44s)]
*  So even if they do succeed in killing this commander or other leaders of these militia groups, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  does that mean that these attacks on U.S. forces stop? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=344.56s)]
*  And it's just too early to say, but it's a very difficult challenge [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=348.0s)]
*  because there are years of this kind of thing going on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=352.32s)]
*  Iran uses these proxies to exert influence and create huge headaches for its adversary. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=355.68s)]
*  So it's truly to say how effective this will be over time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=362.56s)]
*  And again, I think the administration is really putting its chips on the idea of diplomacy, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=366.48s)]
*  that they can help forge a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=371.28s)]
*  and that will reduce tensions and that will sort of take away this, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=375.6s)]
*  stop this cycle, this escalatory cycle we're in right now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbVMi7CiBQ&t=380.0s)]
