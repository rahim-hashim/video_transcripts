Video Description: A year on, the devastation and suffering in Gaza continues. But this week, nearly 100 American healthcare volunteers who treated patients in Gaza are trying to put an end to it. Together they sent a letter to President Biden and Vice President Harris urging a ceasefire and arms embargo to Israel. One of those volunteers, Dr. Mark Perlmutter, recounts what he saw firsthand.

# 'Their brains were missing': doctor says he treated child patients who were targeted in Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs)
*  Razan Barbach is a three-year-old Palestinian girl whose life has been forever altered by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=0.0s)]
*  an Israeli airstrike in Khan Yunus. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=5.48s)]
*  Her mother said she woke up in a hospital bed and said, Mom, extend my feet. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=7.98s)]
*  When the video was taken, Razan didn't know yet that she had lost both of her legs. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=13.24s)]
*  Her mother didn't know how to tell her. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=17.56s)]
*  This is the devastating new normal for the children of Gaza one year into this war. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=19.92s)]
*  A new report by humanitarian group Oxfam International says more women and children have been killed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=24.44s)]
*  in Gaza than in any other conflict in the world over the past two decades. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=29.76s)]
*  Oxfam reports more than 6,000 women and 11,000 children have been killed, but those figures [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=34.9s)]
*  are a conservative estimate because they don't include tens of thousands of children who [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=40.6s)]
*  remain missing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=45.74s)]
*  This comes as nearly 100 American healthcare volunteers who travel to Gaza sent a letter [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=47.14s)]
*  to President Biden and Vice President Harris urging an immediate arms embargo to Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=52.52s)]
*  In that letter, Dr. Mark Perlmutter writes, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=57.78s)]
*  We wish you could hear the cries and screams our conscience will not let us forget. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=59.98s)]
*  We cannot fathom why you continue arming the country that is deliberately killing these [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=65.1s)]
*  children en masse. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=70.17999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Perlmutter joins me now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=72.02s)]
*  Doctor, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=74.1s)]
*  You also wrote in that letter, we wish you could see the nightmares that plague so many [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=76.98s)]
*  of us since we have returned. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=81.92s)]
*  Does it feel maddening to you, Doctor, to see this level of devastation and not see [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=84.54s)]
*  anything significantly change in terms of how the U.S. treats Israel? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  Oh, we're—it's horrible. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=95.18s)]
*  The United States is responsible for 80 percent of the bombs that have dropped on the innocent [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=99.26s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  We are conflating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=106.86000000000001s)]
*  And every time the students protest or anybody protests, we're told that this is anti-Semitic, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=112.78s)]
*  when in fact what we're witnessing is a pure Israeli right-wing government's land grab [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=118.3s)]
*  of innocent Palestinian land. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=124.69999999999999s)]
*  And we're enabling that by buying 2,000-pound bombs that were meant to penetrate, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=127.52s)]
*  granite in Afghanistan and bust bunkers. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=133.18s)]
*  And they're dropping them on tent cities, killing untold numbers of human beings, innocent [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=136.22s)]
*  human beings. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=142.14s)]
*  This is not Israel looking for the isolated Hamas soldier. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  This is Israel deliberately killing the Palestinian civilians, deliberately targeting. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=146.88s)]
*  You and your fellow health care workers also write that the death toll in Gaza is far greater [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=152.45999999999998s)]
*  than the numbers we have from the Palestinian Health Ministry, currently around 41,000 people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  You all estimate that it's closer to or more than 118,000. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  That is about 5 percent of Gaza's total population. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=167.7s)]
*  How do you explain that huge gap? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=170.74s)]
*  How did you get to that number? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=172.22s)]
*  That was calculated by researchers that published it recently in Lancet. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=174.54000000000002s)]
*  And all one has to do is look at the early figures after the Haitian earthquake or the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=179.5s)]
*  earthquake that was recently in Turkey. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=185.38s)]
*  The numbers climbed exponentially. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=189.06s)]
*  And those are bodies that were recovered from excavation of the rubble. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=191.3s)]
*  There's hundreds of millions of tons of rubble that have never — it may be decades before [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=195.34s)]
*  it's excavated in Gaza. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=200.3s)]
*  We dropped — and most Americans don't appreciate this — we dropped the equivalent of not [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=204.26s)]
*  just the bomb that fell on Nagasaki, which is bigger than the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=209.22s)]
*  We dropped the equivalent of the atomic bomb that fell on both Hiroshima and Nagasaki on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=214.68s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, in the equivalents of TNT. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  The amount of destruction that American tax dollars have paid for is immeasurable. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=225.98s)]
*  In a political — sorry, go ahead. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  I was just going to say the number of people that will never be accounted for is huge. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=234.62s)]
*  I myself have seen people that were brought to the ER that were shredded like paper. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=239.94s)]
*  There's no way to identify them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=244.7s)]
*  Yeah, and I wanted to actually ask you about that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  It's a striking point that you made in this letter to Biden and Harris, that every one [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=250.42s)]
*  of you who worked in an emergency room, intensive care or surgical setting treated children [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  with shots to the head and chest on a regular basis. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=259.82s)]
*  We've heard accounts like this, of course, from other doctors who volunteered in Gaza, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=265.06s)]
*  but I wanted to ask you specifically about your own experience. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=269.34s)]
*  Tell us about what it is that you saw that made you believe these young children were [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=272.06s)]
*  targeted with shots to the head and the chest. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=277.38s)]
*  Well, first of all, everybody that was with our team has vast experience with high-velocity [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=281.06s)]
*  bullet wounds. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=285.58000000000004s)]
*  And there's a distinct difference between a pistol round and a high-velocity bullet [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=288.1s)]
*  wound. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=291.42s)]
*  We had children that were hit with such high-velocity bullet wounds exactly where I would put my [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=292.42s)]
*  stethoscope. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=297.94s)]
*  And when we rolled them over, the entire chest cavity is missing from them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=299.74s)]
*  Everything between their shoulder blades, their spinal cord, their lungs, their hearts [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  is never even brought into the operating room. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  And then they were shot perfectly in their temple and their brains are missing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=310.94s)]
*  No child could shot twice by mistake by a sniper. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=317.26s)]
*  One child was ripped out of his father's hand as he was walking them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=321.42s)]
*  He went looking for them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=326.38s)]
*  Ten meters away, he found his child. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=327.5s)]
*  And as he looked over for him, he was shot the second time in the head. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=329.38s)]
*  He didn't even know he was shot in the chest first, but he saw the head hit. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=333.1s)]
*  And then he was brought to our ER. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=337.70000000000005s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=339.70000000000005s)]
*  Dr. Mark Perlmutter, I can't even begin to imagine the horrors that you and other doctors [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=340.70000000000005s)]
*  have seen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for sharing your experience and your insights with us. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=348.06s)]
*  Dr. Mark Perlmutter. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=350.98s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=351.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNk7YDq_Axs&t=352.98s)]
