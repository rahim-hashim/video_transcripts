# 'The big winner is Bibi Netanyahu': Rick Stengel on Netanyahu's praise of President Trump
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo)
*  Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is understandably singing President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=0.0s)]
*  praises for the airstrikes in Iran. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=5.88s)]
*  Netanyahu said, quote, President Trump is fiercely leading the free world. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=8.44s)]
*  He's a great friend of Israel like no one before him. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=13.4s)]
*  Rick Stengel is back with us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=16.6s)]
*  Rick, is this effectively mission accomplished for Israeli President Netanyahu? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=18.64s)]
*  Oh, Catherine, I'm glad you brought up Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=23.88s)]
*  I remember when I was editor of Time, we used to do every week winners and losers. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  The big winner is Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=33.6s)]
*  He is essentially functioning as our director of national intelligence. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=36.56s)]
*  I mean, the president is listening to him rather than our own gigantic intelligence agency. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  I remember when I was in the State Department, John Kerry used to come into the morning [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=46.68s)]
*  meeting shaking his head because he just got off the phone for 45 minutes of being berated [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=50.56s)]
*  by Bibi. I'm sure Tony Blinken had the same experience. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  But the downside of a president like President Trump, who thinks foreign policy is about [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=58.63999999999999s)]
*  personality rather than a nation's interest, is why he succumbs to Bibi's view of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  situation. Netanyahu has tried to persuade the last three presidents, including Trump [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  in his first term, that Iran was this far away from having a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=75.8s)]
*  Well, he finally persuaded Donald Trump in his second term. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=81.28s)]
*  That's not a president who is representing America's interests. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=85.27999999999999s)]
*  That's a president who's doing the bidding of the head of a foreign government. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think that happens, Rick? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=92.72s)]
*  I mean, as somebody who understands American politics and certainly understands the laws [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=95.28s)]
*  in this country, the intelligence agency, our diplomatic objectives, why is it that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  time and time again, American presidents going back to Barack Obama get outmaneuvered, if [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=107.24s)]
*  you will? They, you know, Prime Minister Netanyahu came and basically lobbied Congress [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=113.96s)]
*  to not go along with the JCPOA. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=118.8s)]
*  He infamously defied President Biden's red lines in Gaza. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=121.36s)]
*  And yet, once again here, he managed to find in President Trump somebody who was willing, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  as you said, go with his intelligence over the American community's intelligence. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=130.12s)]
*  Well, and as you know, he's very persuasive and kind of his secret sauce is he grew up [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=138.04s)]
*  here. He went to high school in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=143.56s)]
*  He understands America as well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  He understands Israel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=147.32s)]
*  He knows that being close to the U.S. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=148.84s)]
*  is absolutely important for an Israeli prime minister. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  We are Israel's big brother. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=154.76s)]
*  He needs to look out for us just the way we look out for him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  But again, other presidents, Barack Obama, who I worked for, was always very wary of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=160.04s)]
*  trying to get locked in by Bibi into the point of view where he is representing Israel's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=166.92s)]
*  interests. Israel's interests are not necessarily America's interests. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  So quickly, Rick, if he's the winner right now, is he done making requests of President [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  Trump? What more might he ask of the United States? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=183.68s)]
*  Look, I think it depends on what Iran does and it depends on what what happens in the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=189.44s)]
*  next weeks and days. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=193.44s)]
*  I mean, the critical thing now, I think, and you guys have been talking about this, is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=194.8s)]
*  does Iran's reaction try to get the United States involved in a larger Middle East war? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=199.64s)]
*  Or will they show some restraint in terms of calculating what their response is so it [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=207.0s)]
*  doesn't doesn't get a U.S. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=212.48s)]
*  response? Remember, I don't even know what what how Bibi wants to do that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=213.96s)]
*  Donald Trump seems to feel that this raid is a one and done and then Iran will come to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=219.44s)]
*  the table. Well, that would be that would be the best possible outcome in my opinion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=225.2s)]
*  Rick Stengel, thank you so much for joining us this evening. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ88XlrUCgo&t=229.16s)]
