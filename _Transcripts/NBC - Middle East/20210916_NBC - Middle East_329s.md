# Taliban Makes Promises Of Peace To Women
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s)
*  This week in Kandahar, Afghanistan thousands protested against the Taliban as it forcibly evicted more than 3,000 people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=0.0s)]
*  Demonstrators took to the streets in front of the governor's office after thousands in a government-owned residence were given three days to leave. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=7.84s)]
*  This, as rumors circulate, that the Taliban is in the midst of internal conflict between hardliners and pragmatists. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=14.92s)]
*  Joining me now is Mahbubu Siraj. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=21.28s)]
*  She is the founder of Afghan Women's Network and was just highlighted in Time's 100 Most Influential People's List. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=23.28s)]
*  She remained in Kabul as the Taliban took over that country, dedicated to her work and to holding the Taliban to their promises to women. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. I know it is late there in Afghanistan. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=38.56s)]
*  What does life look like in Afghanistan right now for you and women? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=48.0s)]
*  Life for women, for the women of Afghanistan and me at this point, it's kind of, how shall I say, foggy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=50.48s)]
*  We really don't know what is going to be happening, really. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=60.08s)]
*  So we are kind of, you know, taking every day as it comes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  Every single day there are new news or new, how shall I say, maybe they're not real news, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  but people are talking about it and things are happening. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=78.64s)]
*  And none of them are really that very, how shall I say, very happy for the women. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=82.64s)]
*  But life goes on and we are kind of, you know, going on with it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=88.88s)]
*  There's not there's not really much I can say because not a whole lot is happening because the government that it is right now, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=95.08s)]
*  the Taliban government, they are not really taking any decisive decisions and they are not coming up with rules and regulations, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=102.52s)]
*  how they want it, what do they want and what is happening. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=113.08s)]
*  So it still is kind of unknown. Some parts of the city, some people are doing certain amounts of things to people and other parts of the city. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=116.24s)]
*  Things are people are doing some other things. So the same way with the provinces. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=124.36s)]
*  So it really depends on who you're dealing with. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=129.44s)]
*  So really, that's what was your personal calculation as to whether or not you were going to leave Afghanistan? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=132.92s)]
*  Did that thought ever cross your mind and tell us why you decided to stay despite the risk of what the Taliban represents for women? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=140.8s)]
*  Well, you know, you see, in 1978, when I had to leave Afghanistan, that was a time when I did not have much of a choice about that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=149.68s)]
*  And although the United States accepted me as a, you know, as a and then I became a citizen and I lived in this country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=158.4s)]
*  But all of my life, I really felt like like a refugee. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  And then when I came to Afghanistan in 2003 and I started living here, you know, with the Afghans and and life was started becoming very different. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=169.12s)]
*  I really, I really felt a sense of belonging. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=178.96s)]
*  And that sense of belonging is something that at this point in my life, at this age of mine, I really didn't want to give up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=182.28s)]
*  Although although I wasn't sure about how I would have that feeling when the Taliban comes, how it's going to be. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=189.68s)]
*  But that was the risk I took. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=198.72s)]
*  And I decided to stay because it's becoming very important to me to be in this country, to be a witness, to see what is happening. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=200.8s)]
*  And if there's anything I can do to help maybe ease the blow of some of the things that are happening or maybe make a sense out of it and maybe talk to people or whatever. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=211.12s)]
*  Somebody has to do it. And I thought I thought I want to do that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=224.8s)]
*  So I'm very gladly staying in Afghanistan. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=228.56s)]
*  Yeah. And your work is obviously being recognized now around the world. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=231.56s)]
*  As I mentioned, Time magazine listed you on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=234.72s)]
*  As you are being recognized, this and perhaps as the spotlight shifts away from Afghanistan, what message do you want people around the world to hear about you and your organizations? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=239.4s)]
*  Well, you know, the message that I want the people of the world to hear is that, you know, it's for them to try not to let their governments to make the same mistakes, the mistakes that have been done in Afghanistan over and over again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=250.76s)]
*  Because if we if we allow it, that's if we allow our governments, that's what they're going to be doing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  My message is really for the people of the world, for the men and women of the world to to really stand next to each other, especially to the woman. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  I want to I want to solidarity with the women of the world, something that I always knew it is very possible. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=280.88s)]
*  But now now I can see it being very possible. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  Just to be watchful for each other and not to let things go so much out of hand that it will be hard to fix it or whatever happens as a mistake. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=290.72s)]
*  The result of it will be something that will be thousands of times worse than we got into it or when we started. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5npR3dohQ-s&t=301.88s)]
