# ‘What peace?’: MAGA demands Nobel Peace Prize for Trump after bombing Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Do you remember like three nights ago when Donald Trump ordered the US to bomb Iran and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=0.0s)]
*  How very clear he was the US had obliterated Iran's nuclear capabilities. They were gone. They were done [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=6.24s)]
*  It was over and then they bombed a US base and cutter and retaliation [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=12.56s)]
*  Although no one was heard and then he announced a ceasefire that would last for eternity [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=17.12s)]
*  Today our president screamed obscenities on TV because it didn't last for eternity doesn't maybe even exist now [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=23.0s)]
*  unclear [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=29.84s)]
*  Cover your ears because we were also learning that obliterated might not be exactly accurate either [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=31.84s)]
*  As Trump travels to Europe for a meeting with NATO partners US officials are telling multiple outlets that according to a new [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency those strikes only set Iran's nuclear program back by about six months [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=44.0s)]
*  Six months the finding suggests that President Trump's statement that Iran's nuclear facilities were obliterated was overstated [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=51.52s)]
*  Wait Trump overstated it. No [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  In response White House spokeswoman Caroline, Lievit said no obliterated [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  Demean President Trump and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=73.28s)]
*  program [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=80.6s)]
*  I shouldn't hear note the mission was run by bomber pilots not fighter pilots, but I digress she went on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=81.64s)]
*  Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets total obliteration [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=87.72s)]
*  But it didn't deny the content of that classified report or its existence [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  We should note she simply said it should not have leaked to the public which I have to say is in line with what the Trump [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=100.28s)]
*  Administration has been out there saying [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=105.96s)]
*  Are you saying there that the United States did not see intelligence that the supreme leader had ordered weaponization [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=109.96s)]
*  That's irrelevant I think that question being asked on the media all that's any relevant question [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=119.88s)]
*  That is the key point in US intelligence assessment. You know, it's not yes. It was no, it's not [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=123.56s)]
*  That's not how intelligence is read. That's not how intelligence is used [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=128.44s)]
*  Here's what the whole world knows [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=131.48s)]
*  Forget about intelligence [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=133.08s)]
*  Forget about intelligence remember when Trump was read back what his own intelligence estimate was and said it's wrong [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=135.08s)]
*  This morning Trump was worked up not at internal reports that the strikes were a limited success at best [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=141.08s)]
*  But the news outlets that were reporting on it [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=147.08s)]
*  Iran will never rebuild its nuclear from there. Absolutely not that place is under rock that place is demolished [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=151.08s)]
*  The b2 pilots did their job. They did it better than anybody could even imagine they hit [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=159.08s)]
*  Late in the evening. It was dark with no moon and they hit that target with every one of those things and that place is gone [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=163.08s)]
*  But when I see CNN all night long, they're trying to say well, maybe it wasn't really as demolished as we thought [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=171.08s)]
*  It was demolished that you take a look at the pinpricks and you see that place is gone [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=177.08s)]
*  And I will say I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the beat news. I think that MSD and CO to apologize [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=183.08s)]
*  I think these guys really these networks and these cable networks are real losers. You really are [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=191.08s)]
*  You're really [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=199.08s)]
*  Now we're in the middle of a dynamic situation with contradictory accounts coming out of the US government [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=201.08s)]
*  It is genuinely difficult to know what is going on in the world right now [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=205.08s)]
*  I'll just be clear with you as someone whose job is to sort of consume this and synthesize it and talk to people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=209.08s)]
*  It's just not clear at this point. That's really where we are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=215.08s)]
*  But there is something that's clear. The one constant in all this is Donald Trump's ego [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=217.08s)]
*  His words and his actions in this crisis suggest he wants to be seen as both the Churchillian wartime leader and also the great peacemaker [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=225.08s)]
*  And so after bombing Iran and Iran retaliating and bombing our base and then Trump declaring on social media a forever ceasefire [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=233.08s)]
*  No war will ever happen again. And then this morning he seemed pretty angry. It wasn't working [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=241.08s)]
*  Again warning some of our viewers. He used some choice language [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=247.08s)]
*  Do you believe that Iran is still committed to peace? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=251.08s)]
*  Yeah, I do. They violated it, but Israel violated it too [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=255.08s)]
*  Israel as soon as we made the deal they came out and they dropped a load of bombs the likes of which I've never seen before [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=259.08s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=267.08s)]
*  You know when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=271.08s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=277.08s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't go out this morning [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=281.08s)]
*  Because the one rocket that didn't land that was shot perhaps by mistake that didn't land. I'm not happy about that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=287.08s)]
*  You know what, we basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=295.08s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=304.08s)]
*  Now just to be clear that like there were actual casualties, there was damage, people died in those exchanges that happened after Trump had announced the ceasefire [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=307.08s)]
*  The forever peace that he took credit for overnight on social media [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=316.08s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it's happening [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=320.08s)]
*  It's not even the first time in the past week he has vented about not getting recognition as the peace president [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=322.08s)]
*  Well they should give me the Nobel Prize for Rwanda and if you look at the Congo or you could say Serbia, Kosovo, you could say a lot of them [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=330.08s)]
*  You could say, I mean the big one is India and Pakistan. I should have gotten it four or five times. I should get it for the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=340.08s)]
*  I would think the Abraham Accords would be a good one too. They won't give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=349.08s)]
*  Yeah well tell that to Henry Kissinger [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=357.08s)]
*  Just two days before bombing Iran, Donald Trump clamoring for a Nobel Peace Prize which he says he should have gotten four or five times [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=359.08s)]
*  Now I gotta say in fairness to him, this is not a new obsession [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=366.08s)]
*  When Obama got it, here are the headlines, President Obama gets the Nobel Prize [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=369.08s)]
*  Obama got it like in his first couple of weeks and nobody knew why he got it, including him. Remember, he couldn't tell you why [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=376.08s)]
*  He won the Nobel Peace Prize, oh do you know this? Can you believe it? He won the Nobel Peace Prize [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=384.08s)]
*  They probably will never give it to me even what I'm doing in Korea and Idlib province and all of these places [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=390.08s)]
*  They probably will never give it to me. You know why? Because they don't want to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=397.08s)]
*  I think I'm gonna get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things if they gave it up fairly, which they don't [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=402.08s)]
*  In fact this week the MAGA right went out demanding Trump get a prize for a strike that again nobody's sure achieved his objective [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=407.08s)]
*  And a ceasefire that nobody's sure really exists where we're holed [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=414.08s)]
*  I think we're gonna see the fruits of this decision tonight play out for many many years to come [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=418.08s)]
*  And if the Nobel Peace Prize were worth anything anymore, I would say the President certainly deserves one [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=423.08s)]
*  President Trump is going to win the Nobel Peace Prize, no doubt [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=428.08s)]
*  Rather than World War III, we may get more peace [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=432.08s)]
*  And rather than 34 felony counts, President Trump may end up with 34 Nobel Peace Prizes [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=435.08s)]
*  Now the reason we're showing you all this is because there's sort of a consistent theme here, sort of key to understanding what we're seeing [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=440.08s)]
*  It's a dynamic that we've seen in other Trump-caused crises [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=446.08s)]
*  Do you remember the way that he risked nuclear war with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in the first term? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=450.08s)]
*  This has all been kind of memory-holed, but it was a huge deal [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=455.08s)]
*  Do you remember Trump threatening fire and fury and like going off half-cocked on social media? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=457.08s)]
*  And then doing a 180 became the first president to eagerly meet with Kim and subsequently bragged about the love letters between them [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=462.08s)]
*  And in the end, nothing really changed [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=470.08s)]
*  North Koreans are still under sanctions. They still have nuclear weapons [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=475.08s)]
*  Trump's fire and fury and then his pivot as big peacemaker, it was all basically content [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=479.08s)]
*  It was an episode in the show [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=484.08s)]
*  And you could see it in the way Trump campaigned on ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, saying they'd never happen on his watch [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=487.08s)]
*  He'd get them solved on day one [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=492.08s)]
*  Instead, on Ukraine, he had a disastrous, embarrassing meeting with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=494.08s)]
*  And then basically just lost interest after like giving it like a week of effort [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=500.08s)]
*  His solution for Gaza, which he kind of just announced with Netanyahu there in the White House, was a plan to essentially ethnically cleanse it to turn it into a luxury development [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=505.08s)]
*  That's gone nowhere so far, thankfully [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  He also reportedly told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to bomb Iran [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=517.0799999999999s)]
*  That failed [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  Then he ordered American bombs and seems furious that his mere involvement has not solved Middle East peace [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=523.0799999999999s)]
*  Statesmanship and diplomacy take a lot of hard work [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=529.08s)]
*  It takes more than a few hours or a few minutes of watching TV to understand the stakes and the stakeholders [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=535.08s)]
*  Trump talks about every conflict kind of the same like about these warring parties like school year brawlers or the subject of thousand year enmities [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=542.08s)]
*  And if it takes more than a minute and a minimum of effort to get them separated, he just loses interest [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=551.08s)]
*  He looks for the next opportunity for glory and that's why we are here [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=556.08s)]
*  But again, it's not a show [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=560.08s)]
*  It's very real [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=563.08s)]
*  Actual war, actual people dying, a dangerous moment of confusion and uncertainty about what exactly comes next [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=565.08s)]
*  You [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpVIu1LdYhE&t=586.08s)]
