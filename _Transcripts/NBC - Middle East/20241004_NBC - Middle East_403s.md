# ‘This could escalate very quickly’: Council on Foreign Relations Pres. on Israel-Hezbollah conflict
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk)
*  And joining us now is Michael Froman, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=0.0s)]
*  and the former U.S. trade representative. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=4.66s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=7.84s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=8.84s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=9.84s)]
*  Well, this is a fraught time in the region. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=10.84s)]
*  There are economic implications, of course, as well. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  The Persian Gulf neighbors are nervous, but actually would not mind if Iran was seriously [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=16.6s)]
*  defeated, very frankly. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=23.04s)]
*  Netanyahu, according to a lot of reporting and some of my conversations with officials [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=26.36s)]
*  there and elsewhere in the region, he sees an opportunity here because he believes very [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=30.84s)]
*  strongly that Iran is the head of this axis with all of their proxies that were determined [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  to destroy Israel, to eliminate Israel entirely, according to Israeli officials who talked [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=43.84s)]
*  to us last week in New York at the UN, by 2040, that they had a timeline and that the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=49.66s)]
*  attacks from Hezbollah were about to become that, that Hamas jumped the gun on Hezbollah [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  and its allies on October 7th, a year ago. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=63.16s)]
*  So they feel justified in that there's a window here in our own election calendar. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=67.48s)]
*  Well, it is a fraught time, as you said, Andrea. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=72.36s)]
*  Hezbollah has always been Iran's second strike capability. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=76.2s)]
*  They wanted Hezbollah to be there and be strong in threatening Israel so that Israel did attack [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=79.2s)]
*  them and their nuclear sites. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=84.2s)]
*  They could retaliate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=85.68s)]
*  Now they're seeing Hezbollah seriously degraded with the political and the military leadership [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=86.68s)]
*  largely eliminated. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  A lot of their military capabilities also degraded. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  On one hand, in Iran, it may be pushing them to the decision that they need to cross over [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=97.4s)]
*  into the nuclear threshold because they no longer have that second strike capability. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=102.0s)]
*  On the other hand, as you said, that's the one thing Israel has said they will not permit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=106.4s)]
*  It's for Iran to get a nuclear weapon, not just Israel, but the United States and others [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=110.22s)]
*  have said the same. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=113.92000000000002s)]
*  And so it's a very fraught time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=115.36s)]
*  We don't know yet, as your reporter said, what Netanyahu intends to do in terms of retaliation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=116.92s)]
*  But this could escalate very quickly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=122.76s)]
*  And interestingly, the US does not know. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=124.56s)]
*  They have very little, it's proved that they have very little leverage in terms of either [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=127.08s)]
*  the ceasefire in Gaza, more humanitarian aid getting into Gaza, the timing of what happened [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=131.2s)]
*  with Hezbollah, the pagers they didn't know about. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=137.64s)]
*  They didn't know about the Haniya assassination. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=140.36s)]
*  They didn't know about the Dezraala assassination in advance. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=142.16s)]
*  We don't know all the conversations that might be happening behind the scenes, but certainly [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=145.1s)]
*  the US is not calling the shots here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=148.42s)]
*  And there's a lot of deference to Israel for them to figure out what's in their security. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=150.78s)]
*  The president has said he doesn't want the nuclear sites attacked. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=154.62s)]
*  But there was discussion, including as recently as last night, about whether oil infrastructure, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=158.22s)]
*  refineries, export terminals might be on the list as well as military targets. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=162.78s)]
*  What if there is a hit on the oil strikes or some really large hit on Iran, which then [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=167.96s)]
*  there's a tit for tat, then they go back and forth, and then you're in a regional war? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=176.96s)]
*  That could affect the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  It certainly could affect the Red Sea with the Houthis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=184.0s)]
*  We have a lot of forces there, and we've been taking American citizens out by charter. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=187.52s)]
*  But you're talking about big implications. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=192.5s)]
*  What do you see in the oil markets, for instance? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=197.4s)]
*  Prices going up with all of this talk, the war talk. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=199.34s)]
*  But experts are telling me that there's so much overcapacity in the oil supply and that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=202.28s)]
*  the Saudis and the US could quickly ramp up production. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=207.68s)]
*  Oil is up this week, almost 10 percent. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  But what's remarkable is with all the tension in the Middle East over the last year, that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=214.56s)]
*  oil is only $75 a barrel or so. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=219.36s)]
*  And as you said, the excess capacity in Saudi Arabia, in the United States and elsewhere, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=222.4s)]
*  plus the reduced demand, particularly in China, where the economy has slowed, is affecting [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=227.36s)]
*  the overall macroeconomic environment around the oil markets. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=232.28s)]
*  I want to talk to you about your article in Foreign Affairs, because you talk about the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  economic challenges to whoever is elected the next president, and you have very divergent [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=238.4s)]
*  proposals, economic proposals, from these two candidates. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  You warned that the Biden administration has embraced a range of economic tools, export [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=248.92s)]
*  controls, restrictions on inward and outbound foreign investment tariffs, industrial policy, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=254.2s)]
*  antitrust enforcement. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=259.4s)]
*  The next president, whether Trump or Kamala Harris, are going to need to develop a more [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=260.96s)]
*  systematic approach. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  There's not a real integration in all of these different tools. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=265.96s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=269.47999999999996s)]
*  I think the Biden administration has been quite targeted in their approach. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  They focused on very key technologies in order to both reduce their export to China. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=273.0s)]
*  Chips and the most advanced chips, and also to restrain foreign investment into our country [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=278.64s)]
*  and outward foreign investment. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=284.96s)]
*  But the question is, what would the next administration do? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=287.32s)]
*  And having opened the Pandora's box, does this become an excuse for broader protectionism? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  Are we trying to prevent China from getting the materials they need to compete with us [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=294.55999999999995s)]
*  militarily or to strengthen their intelligence capability or to compete with us in general? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=297.76s)]
*  And those lead to very different kinds of restrictions. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=302.32s)]
*  All of these may make sense, but there's a trade-off involved. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=305.92s)]
*  And one thing that the next president is going to have to do is address the issue of, well, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=308.92s)]
*  we want to reduce our dependence on China. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  We also don't want to have inflation and high cost of living. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=315.44s)]
*  And the things that we do to reduce our dependence on China almost certainly are going to raise [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=319.02000000000004s)]
*  the cost of goods ultimately for the consumer. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=323.16s)]
*  And that's just a trade-off that we have to have a political discussion about. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  And what about the Trump proposal, which relies on tariffs so broadly and says this is a revenue [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=329.12s)]
*  razor rather than talking about it as a tax on American consumers? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=334.52s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  He's proposed a 60 percent tariff on anything coming from China and up to a 20 percent tariff [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  on the rest of our imports, including from allies and partners around the world. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=344.35999999999996s)]
*  That would be quite disruptive. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=348.68s)]
*  It would cost the average American family at least $2,600. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=350.09999999999997s)]
*  It is a tax on the American family. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=353.52s)]
*  And despite what the former president says, it's ultimately the consumer or the importer, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=355.58s)]
*  the manufacturer who needs that input in order to be competitive in the market that's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=360.4s)]
*  ultimately paying that cost. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=364.96s)]
*  Again, there may be cases where tariffs might be appropriate, but we ought to make sure [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=366.67999999999995s)]
*  we're doing it clear-eyed with what the costs are ultimately going to be. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  Michael Froman, what a pleasure to have you here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=375.08s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=376.76s)]
*  The new president, not so new, a couple of months now, of the Council on Foreign Relations. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=377.76s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiQOq4fGdk&t=390.4s)]
