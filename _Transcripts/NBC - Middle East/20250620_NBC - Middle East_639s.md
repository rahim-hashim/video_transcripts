# 'The U.S. is complicit': Iran casts blame for Israeli attacks on Trump, U.S.
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo)
*  It is day 152 of the second Trump administration and week one of the war between Israel and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Earlier today, the president spoke to reporters and said Iran could have a nuclear weapon [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  within months or even weeks. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=12.56s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=14.64s)]
*  What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=16.6s)]
*  Your intelligence community has said they have no evidence that they are at this point. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=19.32s)]
*  Well, then my intelligence community is wrong. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=22.88s)]
*  Who in the intelligence community said that? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=25.28s)]
*  Your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=27.96s)]
*  She's wrong. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  But the president also said he still wants to be a peacemaker. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=33.32s)]
*  When asked about his two week deadline on a possible U.S. strike, Trump said he's giving [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=37.04s)]
*  Iran a period of time and two weeks would be the maximum. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=41.44s)]
*  My colleague, Andre Mitchell, spoke to the Iranian foreign minister about that looming [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=45.0s)]
*  threat earlier today. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=48.92s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=50.56s)]
*  I think it's up to, you know, Americans, the United States, I mean, to show their determination [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=52.36s)]
*  for going for a negotiated solution. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=65.84s)]
*  We were in the middle of diplomacy when Israel attacked us. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=72.4s)]
*  They had perhaps this plan in their mind and they just needed negotiations, perhaps, to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=77.16s)]
*  cover it up. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=90.28s)]
*  We don't know how we can trust them anymore. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=92.44s)]
*  What they did was in fact a betrayal to diplomacy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=99.28s)]
*  There are sayings by President Trump, his tweets, his interviews, who is clearly saying [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=104.2s)]
*  that we have done this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=109.08s)]
*  Obviously, he's very clearly saying that the United States is leading this war. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=110.48s)]
*  So as far as we are concerned, you know, the U.S. is complicit to this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=116.68s)]
*  European officials also gathered in Geneva today to press Tehran on both its nuclear [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=125.16s)]
*  program and the possibility of a diplomatic path to end the conflict. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=129.8s)]
*  But Iran made it absolutely clear there will be no negotiations as long as strikes with [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=134.08s)]
*  Israel continue. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=139.24s)]
*  And we all know they have today. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  A fresh round of Israeli strikes targeted Western Iran while retaliatory strikes hit [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=142.56s)]
*  southern Israel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=147.72000000000003s)]
*  All right, let's bring in our nightcap. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=149.08s)]
*  It is an excellent group tonight. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize winning winner and NBC National Security editor David Rode joins us. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=152.68s)]
*  CNBC senior analyst. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=157.84s)]
*  And my dear friend Ron Insana, Eddie Glaude, Princeton professor and MSNBC contributor [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=159.32s)]
*  and Tim Miller, host of the bulwark where he is 24-7. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  The amount of content this man is putting out is extraordinary. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  And former communications director for Republican Jeb Bush. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=172.28s)]
*  All right, David, educate us here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=175.44s)]
*  Israel said it is prepared for a prolonged campaign against Iran. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=179.0s)]
*  How long is prolonged in your mind? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  Two weeks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=186.68s)]
*  You're using President Trump's terminology there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=187.84s)]
*  I don't think the Israelis expected Trump to do this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=190.4s)]
*  I think they wanted a quick and decisive victory. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=192.96s)]
*  So this is, you know, Trump has thrown a curveball as he often does without a clear end in sight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  So I think I don't see this extending beyond several weeks, but I do think, you know, there's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=202.32s)]
*  now I think these Israelis will continue to carry out strikes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=207.28s)]
*  But you know, I think they're they're unsure what to do in the wake of Trump setting this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=210.24s)]
*  two week deadline so unexpectedly. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  But but that's sort of exactly it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  It seemed like Netanyahu thought he had Trump convinced. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=219.84s)]
*  But the Israeli military can't destroy this nuclear site on its own. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=224.6s)]
*  It needs the U.S. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=227.96s)]
*  military. So aren't they sort of boxed into a corner if you're Israel? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=228.96s)]
*  Yes, I mean, they they were relying on the B-2 bombers, this this American bunker buster to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=234.0s)]
*  hit Fordo. That's the most important nuclear site in Iran. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=238.96s)]
*  It hasn't been damaged yet. It's you know, there's enriched uranium buried under a mountain [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=243.08s)]
*  there, and it's this U.S. weapon that could possibly penetrate that site and destroy it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=247.32s)]
*  So Israel doesn't have those weapons. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=253.0s)]
*  And I there's an element here, though, of unpredictability in the next two weeks in that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=254.76s)]
*  it's, you know, maybe Bibi is talking about possibly trying to strike Fordo with the weapons, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=259.8s)]
*  the jets and the bombs that Israel has. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  There's pressure on Iran to continue firing ballistic missiles at Israel. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  How many defensive missiles does Israel have to keep fending off these Iranian attacks? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=272.2s)]
*  So I don't think there's a pause here, but the situation is not any more stable than it was [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=278.04s)]
*  before Trump put out this two week deadline. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=283.24s)]
*  Ron, we heard from a whole bunch of voices this week, those who want the U.S. to take action, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=286.6s)]
*  that strikes will be quick. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=292.12s)]
*  But don't we always hear that you covered the invasion of Iraq? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=293.96s)]
*  And I feel like that was the message we heard then. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  And look where that got us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=300.6s)]
*  Is that perhaps the only time it was true was repelling Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait in 1991. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=302.92s)]
*  It was a 48 day war. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  He capitulated, surrendered, moved back into Iraq with his troops, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=309.8s)]
*  set oil fields on fire as he left. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=314.12s)]
*  But that was the fastest military experience we've had in the Middle East. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=316.2s)]
*  If you look at both Afghanistan and Iraq after 9-11, those were multi-year engagements. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=319.72s)]
*  There were attempts at regime change and nation building, which obviously didn't go well. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=325.4s)]
*  And so the question here, as is true with most, I think, policies emanating from the Trump [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=329.48s)]
*  administration is, what exactly is the end game? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=334.12s)]
*  Can you destroy Iran's nuclear capability with one bunker buster bomb? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=336.76s)]
*  And then it's doubtful from everything that I've read it would take multiples just to incapacitate [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  for a period of time that Fodro Nuclear Enrichment Facility. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=347.8s)]
*  So it's very difficult to say what happens here. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=351.48s)]
*  And if anyone is contemplating regime change, we all know about the difficulties there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=353.8s)]
*  It's not done by air. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=358.12s)]
*  It's done on the ground. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=359.4s)]
*  And I'm not sure with 92 million people in Iran, that's a war that the United States really wants [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=360.68s)]
*  to involve itself in. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=366.76s)]
*  LISA DESJARDINS [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=367.72s)]
*  Did you add the 92 million people, because you know Ted Cruz likes to watch? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=369.08s)]
*  TIM COOK [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=372.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=373.64s)]
*  LISA DESJARDINS Tim, what do you think about all of the above? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=373.88s)]
*  TIM COOK [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=376.76s)]
*  I noticed that Ron got a good friend in the intro. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=379.0s)]
*  So, mostly, I just... [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=382.12s)]
*  LISA DESJARDINS He did. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=383.24s)]
*  TIM COOK I'm going to invite you out to drinks next time I'm in New York, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=383.4s)]
*  so I can get upgraded for the next intro. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=385.32s)]
*  LISA DESJARDINS Sure. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=387.16s)]
*  I'm going to invite you out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=388.04s)]
*  I'm going to invite you out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=388.56s)]
*  LISA DESJARDINS It's just a way to remind you that there's room for improvement. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=388.84s)]
*  So, here you go. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=392.2s)]
*  You're on. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=393.08s)]
*  TIM COOK Good to know. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=393.56s)]
*  Good to know. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=394.84s)]
*  I mean, look, the thing... [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=395.64s)]
*  I was talking to Dan Shapiro, who is Biden's ambassador to Israel and Biden's Middle Eastern [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=398.12s)]
*  adviser, who is supportive of the strikes. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=405.16s)]
*  And we were kind of hashing out this very question of, like, could it be quick? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=408.12s)]
*  Because there's an element to this where there is a single objective, right, going after [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=411.4s)]
*  the nuclear site. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=416.68s)]
*  But the thing that is, I think, nagging in the head of some of us who are watching this is, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  do we really trust Bibi to want it to be quick? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=424.92s)]
*  And there's been a lot of rhetoric coming out of Israel, looking out at Bibi and his [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=427.88000000000005s)]
*  advisers about how this might be a moment for regime change. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  They have been unbelievably successful. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  You have to acknowledge that, taking out military leaders in Iran and in Hezbollah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  And so, like, there might be a temptation to say, let's just... [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=439.0s)]
*  This might be the opportunity to finish the job. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=441.88s)]
*  And then you get into a much expanded conflict. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=443.8s)]
*  And then on top of that, you have Donald Trump over here in our country, who is completely erratic, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=447.72s)]
*  who does not seem to be decisive in this situation at all. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=454.12s)]
*  And you could imagine him wanting to not get involved at all. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=457.64s)]
*  You can also imagine him feeling like he wants to be a winner. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  You can imagine him bungling us into the war. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=465.72s)]
*  I just think that there's a very wide berth of options, of possibilities right now. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=467.56s)]
*  And a lot of them are rife with risk. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=472.36s)]
*  MS. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=474.84s)]
*  BIDEN-GILBERT-MORANGE-WALTZ-SOMMER Erratic is kind of exactly what I want to zero in on, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=476.04s)]
*  because while the president isn't going to show his hand, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=479.8s)]
*  the erratic nature of this makes it so hard, right? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=483.88s)]
*  On one hand, he says he may or may not strike Iran. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=486.36s)]
*  Now he's saying it's a two-week maximum. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=489.4s)]
*  If I'm Iran or I'm Israel, how do I read this? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=491.96s)]
*  The president is not giving any sort of clear message, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=496.04s)]
*  and the stakes almost couldn't be higher. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  Eddie? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=501.32s)]
*  Well, I think you read it as for what it is, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=503.72s)]
*  and that is that you cannot really trust whatever comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=505.8s)]
*  I think, for me, I'm just very unsettled by it all, Stephanie. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=509.24s)]
*  It feels too much like the Iraq War, the drumbeat of war, the bloodlust. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=514.6s)]
*  I'm worried about what it means. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=521.72s)]
*  I mean, he opened the segment with this debate, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=524.68s)]
*  where Donald Trump just simply dismissed the intelligence. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=527.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's Telsey-Gilbert, but he just dismissed it out of hand. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  And so I don't trust a word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=534.68s)]
*  And I think I have the evidence for why that's the case, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=539.2399999999999s)]
*  even though he occupies the office, the Oval Office. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  But I don't know why, as Americans, we should trust him to lead us in this moment domestically. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=545.64s)]
*  And so I don't know. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=552.84s)]
*  I can clearly understand why Iran and Israel might not trust him as well. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=554.2s)]
*  I want to go back to that point. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=559.8s)]
*  You had Donald Trump very publicly dismissing Pete, Hegseth and Telsey-Gilbert, right? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=561.64s)]
*  Here's what intelligence has told you. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=567.24s)]
*  And he's basically like, intelligence, they don't know what they're talking about. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=568.76s)]
*  How does that, how vulnerable, Tim, does that make us when the world is watching [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=572.76s)]
*  and the president is dismissing the very people who, in theory, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=577.88s)]
*  hold the vital information that would put the president in a position to make decisions? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=582.12s)]
*  This is the key question. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=588.8399999999999s)]
*  Are we better off with Pete, Hegseth and Tulsi-Gilbert in the room or out of the room? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=589.8s)]
*  You know, and it speaks to... [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=594.04s)]
*  He picked them. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=595.8s)]
*  Right. Well, yeah, he did pick them. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=596.5999999999999s)]
*  And it speaks to just the absurdity and the insanity of his choices [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=598.28s)]
*  and the fact that the Republican senators all went along with this blindly, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=602.8399999999999s)]
*  because they were worried about some election two or four or six years down the road. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=607.4s)]
*  And so they saddled us with a weekend Fox and Friends co-host running the Defense Department [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=612.52s)]
*  and with Tulsi at DNI. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIKCcqJAVo&t=617.24s)]
