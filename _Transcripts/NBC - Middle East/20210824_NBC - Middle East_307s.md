# Pentagon Assures They Are Still Working Towards Deadline For Evacuations
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU)
*  Let's get right to our team covering the latest on Afghanistan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike Memeli there at the White House. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=3.56s)]
*  Courtney Qube at the Pentagon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=5.76s)]
*  She was just in that briefing that we were broadcasting there. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  And Ken Delaney and covers national security and intelligence. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=10.84s)]
*  And Ali Vitali standing by for us on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Courtney, let me start with you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=16.96s)]
*  The Pentagon there not appearing to want to get ahead of the president's decision on whether [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=18.48s)]
*  to extend that withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=23.64s)]
*  You're reporting that decision will likely come today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=26.48s)]
*  Did anything that we just heard their point toward a decision toward a decision one way [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=30.04s)]
*  or the other? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=35.04s)]
*  Not really. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=36.04s)]
*  You know, the Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, kept saying that they were still working [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=37.04s)]
*  towards the August 31st deadline. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=40.72s)]
*  But that being said, it's still up to the president. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=43.1s)]
*  This is a policy decision that the White House has to make. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=45.18s)]
*  The president has to make whether he wants to extend the military mission there in Afghanistan. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And that's not a decision that would be made lightly. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=53.42s)]
*  Let's look at the options here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=56.059999999999995s)]
*  If they decide to extend to allow for more time for Americans and Afghans and other third [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=57.54s)]
*  country nationals to actually get out of the country, the Taliban are completely surrounding [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=63.099999999999994s)]
*  that airport in Kabul right now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=69.02s)]
*  And in fact, they're even controlling several of the gates to get into the civilian side [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=70.78s)]
*  of the airport. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=75.52s)]
*  So if the U.S. were to extend against the wishes of the Taliban, there's a very real [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=76.69999999999999s)]
*  possibility that the Taliban would would attack. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=82.06s)]
*  They would consider it offensive against their any kind of agreements that have been [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=85.66s)]
*  made. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=89.5s)]
*  And there's the possibility that the U.S. troops would come under fire and all of those [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=90.5s)]
*  civilians who are there who would be left there at the airport. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  So the decision is, does the U.S. want to to to take that on? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=97.82s)]
*  Does the U.S. want to get into a fight with the Taliban right now in in Kabul? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  The other side of it is, despite the fact what John Kirby said, that the U.S. has the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=106.78s)]
*  to get all Americans out and as many Afghans as possible. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=112.0s)]
*  The reality is, with this timeline, they the chances are they would not be able to get [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=115.56s)]
*  everyone out who wants to get out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  And that's for several reasons. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=122.88s)]
*  One, if you look at this August 31st deadline, it will take several days, somewhere in the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=124.4s)]
*  neighborhood of three or four days, to get all U.S. troops and Americans who are there [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=128.4s)]
*  at the airport out by that deadline. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=132.8s)]
*  So if you back time that, you're talking the end of this week that the U.S. military would [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=135.6s)]
*  have to start their their retrograde or their withdrawal from that airport. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=138.88s)]
*  That only gives you a couple more days left to get more evacuation flights out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=142.96s)]
*  But beyond that, we know that there are other American citizens and Afghans, potential [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=146.56s)]
*  special immigrant visa candidates who are not inside Kabul and can't get there right now. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=151.56s)]
*  So the so if that's the case, then there are still people who would potentially be left [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=156.44s)]
*  behind if the U.S. were to leave by August 31st. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=162.16s)]
*  It's a difficult decision. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=164.48s)]
*  We are told by U.S. officials that the president will make that decision today, but we don't [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=166.04s)]
*  know if the White House will announce it to the American public. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=170.84s)]
*  Courtney, we just heard General Taylor say, I believe, and you correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  roughly 5000 people in the airport there in Kabul right now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=181.4s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=186.28s)]
*  That's right. So and one thing that's important to point out, you know, for several days, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  there was all this talk about the chaos at the airport and particularly at the gates outside. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  On Saturday, the U.S. military started working more with the Taliban, frankly, on efforts to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=197.44s)]
*  to control the crowds at the gate. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  And that has been working in the last 24 to 48 hours. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=208.6s)]
*  The crush at the gates is less. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=211.48s)]
*  There are the crowds at the gates are much less. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=213.64s)]
*  And that is because the military is is now they're having Americans meet at certain [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=216.56s)]
*  locations and they're sort of bringing them in in smaller interval intervals. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=221.28s)]
*  And that's keeping the crowds at the gates lessened. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=225.32s)]
*  And again, working with the Taliban, they're coordinating with the Taliban to do this as they [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=228.96s)]
*  have been. And they're in these these these constant communications, as John Kirby keeps [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=234.0s)]
*  saying, between the U.S. military commanders there on the ground in Kabul and who are [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=238.44s)]
*  essentially their Taliban counterparts there in Kabul. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  But it has led to the situation at the gates to be a little bit less. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=245.12s)]
*  And part of the reason that that's so critical right now is there is still this continuing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  threat from ISIS, who there's there's specific intelligence that they wanted to attack, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=252.6s)]
*  whether it's the gates or the airport itself or people who are trying to move to the airport. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=258.4s)]
*  And so there was a real concern that as those crowds were growing, that there was a potential [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=262.84s)]
*  for some sort of a suicide attack, whether it's a suicide bomber or maybe even a vehicle [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=267.0s)]
*  borne IED explosive device that could target one of those locations. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=271.24s)]
*  So that is one of the good signs, in addition to the fact that they are getting more people [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  out every single day, particularly the last two days, they have been able to thin some of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  those crowds around the gates by sending the people there in intervals. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHI6cFPQcyU&t=283.32000000000005s)]
