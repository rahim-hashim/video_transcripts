# New access roads, equipment, vehicles spotted at Iran’s Fordo nuclear complex: NYT
**NBC - Middle East:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk)
*  New satellite images taken in the days after the US strikes in Iran show new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=0.0s)]
*  activity at the site of one of the attacks new access roads construction equipment and vehicles [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=5.48s)]
*  Have been seen at the Forto nuclear site [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=10.8s)]
*  That is the one the president insisted was obliterated joining us now staff writer for the Atlantic Michael Shearer and Rick Stengel [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=13.64s)]
*  Who's still with us Rick? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=20.68s)]
*  Can we put that much stock into [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=23.48s)]
*  access roads and trucks and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=26.28s)]
*  Engagement with that site from satellite images [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=29.48s)]
*  You can't really but it's useful to see it [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=32.44s)]
*  I mean the problem Katie is the word obliterated which was used by the president [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=35.3s)]
*  You know a more reasonable person would have said this was a very successful mission [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=40.32s)]
*  We've destroyed a lot of what we were seeking to destroy the accuracy was [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=44.92s)]
*  You know unimpeachable [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=50.8s)]
*  We will now do a battlefield assessment to find out what what has really been accomplished [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=52.96s)]
*  I mean nobody ever beforehand said we're gonna completely obliterate their nuclear threat [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=58.24s)]
*  I mean there was a lot of reporting by the IAEA that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=62.84s)]
*  Small amounts of enriched uranium and tubes were transported before the bombing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=66.48s)]
*  You know again a reasonable president would say you know we did an excellent job [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=71.48s)]
*  Under the circumstances there are still some things that escaped our notice that is now something that we will negotiate over [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=76.76s)]
*  But we've we put way off their ability to produce a nuclear device all right, so there are [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=83.76s)]
*  There's no real time frame Michael on talks with Iran in order to to get somewhere [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=92.0s)]
*  diplomatically after these strikes, and it's being complicated by some reporting that you've been doing and that is the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=97.76s)]
*  Looming threat of assassination Donald Trump is living with this looming threat of assassination from Iran [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=104.44s)]
*  The Washington Post reports that Iran nearly succeeded in orchestrating an assassination of Mike Pompeo in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=110.44s)]
*  Europe in 2022 [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  So it's it's it's a real thing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=119.92s)]
*  That's right [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=124.28s)]
*  You know and we've kind of gotten used to it at this point [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=124.92s)]
*  Which is a real contrast from how it used to be if you remember back in the early 90s George HW Bush [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  Went to Kuwait, and there was an assassination attempt on him [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=132.44s)]
*  by a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=136.72s)]
*  What the US government later identified as Iraqi intelligence services and Bill Clinton the president followed George HW Bush [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=138.48s)]
*  Ordered missile strikes in Iraq in in response to that you know just the attempt it wasn't successful the bomb never went off [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=145.92s)]
*  You know in this case Trump and a number of other former US officials have been the targets of Iranian [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=153.0s)]
*  assassination plots for years ever since the Suleimani assassination during Trump's first term [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  You know the Iranian leaders have spoken openly about wanting this they've had a number of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  people according to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=173.42s)]
*  indictments [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=175.26s)]
*  Sort of concoct kind of harebrained schemes. They're not very sophisticated schemes of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=176.98s)]
*  Sending people over to the US or having people operate from overseas to recruit local criminals to come up with plans to assassinate [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=190.14s)]
*  president [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  You know former NS [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=192.54s)]
*  Now [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=194.94s)]
*  Security adviser John Bolton the former secretary of state and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=196.14000000000001s)]
*  President Trump the Friday before he launched these attacks the day before he launched these attacks [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=200.26s)]
*  He was on the tarmac up in New Jersey, and he made reference to them [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=205.22s)]
*  He told the reporters with him you're in danger even right now, so this is an ever-present [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=208.34s)]
*  Thing now what the White House says and what his advisors say is that the threat against the president did not factor in this decision [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=212.3s)]
*  that this decision was made only because of the nuclear sites, but [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=220.34s)]
*  You know the reality of having to live with this threat is something that that you know has clearly taken a toll on those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=224.42s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder though does it also factor into [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=231.14s)]
*  negotiations [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=234.62s)]
*  Michael shot Michael shot just froze all right the other question. I want to ask you Rick [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  Was on the visit from Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House next week [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=246.82s)]
*  The war in Gaza is ongoing the suffering there is is unimaginable. It's awful [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=251.66s)]
*  We're seeing it every day on our social media feeds a lot of op-eds right now are [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=256.94s)]
*  Urging the Israelis to wind it down warning that their reputation and Jews around the world [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=262.14s)]
*  Will be irreparably harmed because of this war [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=269.1s)]
*  Do we have a sense of what the White House? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=272.78s)]
*  Wants to do in terms of pressing that's in Yahoo to end this [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=275.7s)]
*  It does seem like I don't want to speak for the White House or President Trump [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=279.97999999999996s)]
*  But it does feel like there is a kind of unified field theory of how to solve the Middle East problems that that now that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=284.34s)]
*  Iran has been pushed away from [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  Closeness to a nuclear weapon instigated by the Israelis that should give the Israelis some sense of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=294.53999999999996s)]
*  Safety that they don't have I mean the Iranian surrogates have been diminished Hamas [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=302.14s)]
*  Lebanon [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  So now Trump seems to be pressing for the Israelis to say let's halt this. Let's make a deal. Let's get back to the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=309.38s)]
*  Abraham Accords and have the Gulf nations come and make deals with you that would be a great thing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=316.74s)]
*  What sort of pressure should he be putting on Netanyahu? Well, I think he should be you know to end the war in Gaza. It's a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=322.06s)]
*  catastrophic unimaginable tragedy and disaster [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=328.94s)]
*  There's no winning it the way that you know, you would obliterate nuclear weapons in Iran that there you creating new [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=332.94s)]
*  Members of Hamas that are 10 12 years old [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=339.18s)]
*  Let's get back to negotiations and I do think I know it I sound like an old-fashioned person here [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=343.06s)]
*  But but the problem is now that without a two-state solution. You're not going to get everybody to the table [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=347.9s)]
*  Again, I've always thought you know, they used to say this about the Palestinians. They never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=354.98s)]
*  I would say that about Bibi Netanyahu [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=360.62s)]
*  He had so many opportunities to make a deal with the Palestinians to set up a state that Israel could live with [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=362.62s)]
*  And have a democracy and have some and have have the Palestinians have have some independence [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=368.06s)]
*  I would say he has that opportunity now happen though with him. Can he get anywhere? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=373.02s)]
*  Does he have do are there any other Arab nations that have the desire to negotiate with him? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  Is there any Palestinian leader that would have the desire to negotiate with him? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=384.94s)]
*  I mean, he's not gonna negotiate with Hamas and rightly so but I mean, how do you get anywhere? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=389.7s)]
*  When he is still in charge. Well, that's a good question [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=396.02s)]
*  I do think that the Gulf states the Saudis the Emiratis they would continue to talk to Netanyahu [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=398.9s)]
*  I think they probably are still talking, you know [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=405.62s)]
*  Does that mean Netanyahu could change the last 25 years of him being opposed to a two-state solution? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=408.78s)]
*  I don't know would it take a new Israeli leader? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=414.14s)]
*  I mean his popularity has gone up with the bombing of Iran, but it's still very low [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=417.02s)]
*  He probably wouldn't win a re-election [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=421.26s)]
*  And of course remember that the parties united with him are these you know, very very conservative Orthodox parties [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=423.18s)]
*  They're against, you know, even mentioning the Palestinians [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=429.54s)]
*  You [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9ap8_ESpk&t=446.82s)]
