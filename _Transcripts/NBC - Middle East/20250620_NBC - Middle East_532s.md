# Official: Effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome has dropped to 65%
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA)
*  So, Ned, Iran says it won't negotiate until Israel stops bombing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=0.0s)]
*  If Netanyahu wants to keep fighting and Trump decides he wants diplomacy, how does that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=6.36s)]
*  play out? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Because if Donald Trump says there's two weeks before he'll make a decision about finishing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  the job, but Israel decides, well, we're not going to stop, where does that leave the whole [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=17.36s)]
*  situation? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=23.72s)]
*  Well, Chris, I think when we look at this two-week period, and we have to remember that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=24.72s)]
*  President Trump said he would decide within two weeks, I think there are two potential [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=30.16s)]
*  explanations. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  One is the explanation that the White House offered. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  And if we want to take that at face value, it's the optimistic explanation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=37.64s)]
*  And I should caveat that optimism and hope should be a rare commodity in this administration. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=41.96s)]
*  But I want to believe that President Trump is serious, that he wants to give diplomacy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=47.26s)]
*  a chance. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  And I think that leads really to your question, two paths for that diplomacy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=52.6s)]
*  Number one is a continuation of the path that Steve Whitcock, the president's special envoy, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  has engaged on in recent months, talking in some cases directly with senior Iranian officials [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=60.24s)]
*  to include the Iranian foreign minister. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=66.08s)]
*  And reporting indicates that even as Israeli munitions and bombs have been falling on Iran, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Steve Whitcock has continued to engage in these discussions. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=73.32s)]
*  The second diplomatic path is the one you also referenced, and that's the so-called [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=77.36s)]
*  E3. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=80.76s)]
*  There are European counterparts who were also signatories to the Iran deal meeting in Geneva [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=81.76s)]
*  today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure there are lots of people in the Trump orbit who are sort of rolling their [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  eyes at the Europeans. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=90.4s)]
*  Oh, there goes their happy talk again. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=91.4s)]
*  But in this case, the Europeans do have real leverage, because it's these three European [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=94.44s)]
*  countries that can command essentially UN sanctions to be snapped back onto Iran. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=98.5s)]
*  They have this tremendous economic leverage that I hope they're using to their advantage. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  So between the American pathway and the European pathway, my hope is that we can invert American [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=110.04s)]
*  involvement in a war that should not be ours. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=115.44s)]
*  My concern, the second path, very briefly, Chris, is that this is just two weeks or less [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=118.88s)]
*  than two weeks to get more forces in theater, to take more defensive measures, to be more [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=123.24s)]
*  creative in how to get engaged in this campaign. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=128.44s)]
*  Right now, sitting here today on Friday, I think either one is equally likely, but it [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=132.2s)]
*  sure seems like we'll find out in the coming days what President Trump will decide. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=136.4s)]
*  Yeah. And Courtney, speaking of people who are in the Trump orbit, you have new reporting [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=139.6s)]
*  on who exactly the president is listening to right now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=147.48s)]
*  Yeah. So while President Trump continues to do what he did in his first term here, which [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=150.48s)]
*  is to sort of crowdsource when there's a decision to be made asking people, allies, both inside [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=154.48s)]
*  and outside the White House for their opinion on things, in the case of Iran, while he's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=159.8s)]
*  still doing that to some extent, he's increasingly relying on a smaller and smaller group of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=163.76s)]
*  advisors. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  That includes Vice President J.D. Vance, his chief of staff, Suzy Wiles, Secretary of State [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=168.48s)]
*  Marco Rubio, of course, is also serving as the interim national security adviser, and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=172.84s)]
*  of course, the deputy chief of staff to the White House, Stephen Miller. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  Those are sort of his core group of people who he's turning to as he tries to decide [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  whether in fact to greenlight U.S. military action in Iran. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=184.6s)]
*  Now, notably, two people who, according to a number of defense and senior administration [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  officials we've spoken with, say are sidelined in this process are the director of national [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=192.72s)]
*  intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=197.48s)]
*  She, of course, has pretty vocally, openly opposed U.S. military action in Iran and spoken [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=199.16s)]
*  out very vocally about her concerns about the possibility of any kind of a nuclear conflict. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=204.04s)]
*  And then the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, another person who has been sidelined. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=209.68s)]
*  And what's fascinating about it, Chris, is the officials we spoke with said that in fact [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=214.2s)]
*  the president is listening more to the uniform members of the Department of Defense. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=218.4s)]
*  That includes his relatively new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dan Cain, and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=222.72s)]
*  then the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Eric Carilla. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=226.96s)]
*  Carilla's been at the helm of CENTCOM for three, going on three and a half years throughout [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=229.72s)]
*  a lot of tough times, including October 7th. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=234.68s)]
*  We're told that their advice and their counsel on the situation and what the United States [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=237.52s)]
*  should consider doing and the possible second and third order effects of any military action, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=243.84s)]
*  the president is taking that very seriously. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=248.16s)]
*  This also comes as one of the main bodies or major bodies in past administrations that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=250.88s)]
*  would be used for this kind of decision. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=256.68s)]
*  The National Security Council has been gutted in recent weeks, leaving even fewer voices [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=258.76s)]
*  to potentially provide that sort of counsel to President Trump right now, Chris. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=264.52s)]
*  So Ned, the National Security Council, also sidelined by reports. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=267.8s)]
*  The nation's top intel official, Tulsi Gabbard, leader of the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, in a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  normal administration, in a typical, if there is such a thing, administration, how unusual [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=277.76s)]
*  is that? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=283.92s)]
*  What is lost if all those folks who are usually key to this kind of decision are sidelined? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=285.0s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, this dynamic for people like me gives us some degree of ambivalence because [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=291.6s)]
*  we want to say, you know, President Trump shouldn't be listening in any case to unqualified [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=297.8s)]
*  people like Pete Hegseth or somewhat kooky people like Tulsi Gabbard to begin with. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=303.72s)]
*  And that should at least on the surface give us some comfort that they're not there in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=309.72s)]
*  the situation room for the most sensitive of discussions. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=314.32s)]
*  But look, I spent three years at the National Security Council on my last job at the State [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=316.48s)]
*  Department. I sat in on all of these meetings. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=320.12s)]
*  And the thing to keep in mind is that people, as they sit around the table in the situation [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=322.64s)]
*  room, they are not there in an ideal situation to represent their personal views. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=328.88s)]
*  They are there to read to represent the informed, considered judgment of the department and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=334.56s)]
*  agency they represent. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  So when someone like Tulsi Gabbard is not at the table or when Pete Hegseth is not at [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  the table, the views of the 17 departments and agencies that comprise our intelligence [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=345.44s)]
*  community aren't there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  They're not getting the deference that they're due. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=351.32000000000005s)]
*  And the civilian leadership of the military is not there literally at the table. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=353.8s)]
*  And we have to remember that in this country, there is nothing more important than civilian [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  leadership of our military. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=365.68s)]
*  So, yes, some might take solace in the fact that these people have been relatively sidelined, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=366.88s)]
*  but the process works that way for a reason. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=371.6s)]
*  It's a deliberative process that brings together the perspectives of these departments and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=374.08s)]
*  agencies, not of these individuals. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=378.28s)]
*  And when this process isn't working, the decision making process can't function properly. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=380.6s)]
*  So, Monica, a Republican senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity told us he thinks [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=385.4s)]
*  Trump is going to delay this decision as long as he can. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=390.0s)]
*  What do we know about his thinking? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=393.36s)]
*  Well, we know that this two weeks extension is really a very familiar refrain for the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=395.84s)]
*  president when it comes to any kind of major policy decision and even some that are pretty [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  inconsequential. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=405.44s)]
*  This is something he often likes to do when he wants to buy a little bit more runway. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=406.44s)]
*  And then we all know and remember that sometimes we get to the end of two weeks and it's not [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  a hard and fast deadline. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=414.76s)]
*  It can shift again. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  It can be another couple of weeks. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  It can move or it can never really come as he is predicting here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=418.24s)]
*  So this is an area where, of course, the White House is trying to buy a little bit of time [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  for those diplomatic options that you've been talking about. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=425.8s)]
*  And they do put a lot of stock in that right now. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=428.68s)]
*  They feel that while those talks were pretty much stalled when the fire between Israel [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=431.16s)]
*  and Iran going back and forth began about a week ago, they think and are a little bit [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=436.44s)]
*  more optimistic looking at it today. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  And this is a president who likes to consider himself the ultimate dealmaker. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=443.2s)]
*  He still believes that somehow through negotiating behind the scenes that he can get Iran to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=447.24s)]
*  accept some of the terms for some kind of an agreement that obviously they have been [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=452.68s)]
*  consistently rejecting and saying they will never agree to. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=457.08s)]
*  But he still is holding out hope for that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=460.32s)]
*  But there are a lot of different voices and exactly as Courtney has talked about with [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=462.48s)]
*  her reporting, he is having lunch with people all the time who could be giving him a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=465.92s)]
*  differing perspective like Steve Bannon, who was at the White House and that he sat down [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=470.0s)]
*  with yesterday. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=474.24s)]
*  And he also, we know, is certainly mulling this idea of involving the U.S. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  in a longer term war as one that he is very nervous to do. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=479.64s)]
*  He has spoken about that many times and he has in conversations with advisors worried [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  about that idea that could this be something that is targeted if the U.S. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=488.64s)]
*  military is more involved and done in a shorter term if this is something that's going to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RtpuZegiXA&t=492.12s)]
