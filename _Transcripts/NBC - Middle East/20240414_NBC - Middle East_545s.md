# Top House Foreign Affairs Committee member reveals the only bill that can support Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q)
*  After last night's attack, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Congress will shift [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  its schedule this week to take up legislation to support Israel and, quote, hold Iran accountable. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=5.8s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks of New York. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=12.4s)]
*  He's the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=16.12s)]
*  Welcome, Congressman. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=18.96s)]
*  Congressman, before we get into what is likely to happen in Congress this week, we just had [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=19.96s)]
*  our colleague Andrea Mitchell on, and she reported about a conversation between President [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=24.3s)]
*  Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, where the president of the United States urged the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=29.04s)]
*  prime minister of Israel to exercise restraint to not retaliate against Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=33.24s)]
*  If Netanyahu does not heed that warning from President Biden, where does that then leave [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=39.44s)]
*  the United States? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=45.2s)]
*  Well, I think that the president was very clear, and I'm thankful that Joe Biden is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=46.2s)]
*  the president of the United States right now and not Donald Trump, because he's the adult [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=49.4s)]
*  in the room. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  The president was clear. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=55.04s)]
*  We are ironclad, locked in with Israel for their self-defense. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  But we do not want an offensive. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=62.44s)]
*  We don't need to escalate this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=64.6s)]
*  We need to make sure that we have containment and then de-escalation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=66.48s)]
*  And then there's got to be a movement forward as far as conversation and diplomacy is taking [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  place so that, you know, Iran, I think, out of this, should have learned that the United [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=75.8s)]
*  States stands with Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=82.84s)]
*  Ironclad. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=85.8s)]
*  Israel is going to have the right to exist. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=86.8s)]
*  Ironclad. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=89.64s)]
*  There was a but, though, in your statement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=90.84s)]
*  So what happens if Netanyahu doesn't listen to Biden on this question of retaliation? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=93.2s)]
*  Biden said ironclad in your defense, in your defense. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=97.48s)]
*  So no offensive movements in that regard. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  So what should take place here is that there is a recognition from Iran, Israel has the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=106.2s)]
*  right to exist, and a recognition, what Joe Biden has been saying all the time is, to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=113.16s)]
*  developing and having a two-state solution with the Palestinians. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=119.0s)]
*  Now, that sets us up for a different Middle East. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  We already have individuals who had been like Iran previously, quite frankly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=129.44s)]
*  When you look at Egypt, Jordan, now, you know, we're talking to Saudi Arabia about normalization [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=136.16s)]
*  with Israel, Israel's right to exist. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=142.78s)]
*  So we have a moment in history right now to change what has been taking place in the Middle [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  East for the last 75 years. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=152.84s)]
*  For the last 75 years, it has been the Gulf countries just trying to wipe Israel off the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  map. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=160.6s)]
*  And so the Israelis have to defend itself. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=161.6s)]
*  And that's why we stood and will continue to stand, that they have the right to defend [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=163.27999999999997s)]
*  themselves. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  We've also got to acknowledge the right to have a two-state solution. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  That's the way to peace and diplomacy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=173.73999999999998s)]
*  And that's what Joe Biden has been talking about from the very beginning. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=176.44s)]
*  He's been talking about two-state solution. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=179.84s)]
*  And we're ironclad with Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=183.76s)]
*  Anybody who attacks it, we will be there with Israel to prevent it from happening. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=189.2s)]
*  And that's what happened yesterday. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=194.24s)]
*  You know, Congressman Meeks, Simone Sanders here, Townsend. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=196.68s)]
*  You know, the president said yesterday, President Biden, in a White House statement that tomorrow, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=202.12s)]
*  which is now today, he issued this statement late yesterday, that, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=207.48s)]
*  I think Democrats, Republicans alike, can all agree that Iran is no friend of the United [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=211.0s)]
*  States and is a real threat to not just the region, but to us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=239.76s)]
*  That is what is happening diplomatically from other world leaders. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=244.88s)]
*  Italy has already sent out the call to convene that meeting. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=249.48s)]
*  Congress is allegedly, you all are going to take up some type of legislation this week. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  Congressman Scalise has said that the legislative calendar is now changing and that in his statement [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=258.56s)]
*  yesterday that they would start with Israel. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=263.92s)]
*  Do you have any indication that the package that will be taken up will be a package that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  the Senate passed that includes aid to Israel and Ukraine? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=271.16s)]
*  Is this just aid to Israel? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  And if so, what kind of message does that send to our Ukrainian partners? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=277.6s)]
*  The only package that we should be taking up, the only package that I will support, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=283.04s)]
*  is the package that was passed in a bipartisan way in the Senate. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  That a package, the package that includes giving Ukraine what it needs to defend itself, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=296.6s)]
*  giving Israel what it needs to defend itself, giving the Taiwanese what it needs to defend [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=302.8s)]
*  itself, and having humanitarian aid for the individuals in Gaza and around the world. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=308.0s)]
*  That's the only thing that can pass. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=315.64s)]
*  And that's needed right now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=317.32s)]
*  And the only way that you can get something on the president's desk so that all of those [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=319.68s)]
*  items, the Israelis, the Ukrainians, the Taiwanese, and humanitarian aid, the only way that you [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  can do that immediately is pass one bill, the one that was passed in the Senate. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  That could be on the president's desk. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=338.56s)]
*  We pass it tomorrow night when we get back in. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=340.52s)]
*  It could be on the president's desk first thing Tuesday morning. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=343.56s)]
*  And that is what's needed. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=346.96s)]
*  Nothing else. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=348.88s)]
*  What, Congressman, efforts have been made or put in place to get the Foreign Affairs Committee [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=350.88s)]
*  members briefed up on what's happened so far, what the administration is thinking in terms [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=358.76s)]
*  of moving forward? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=366.24s)]
*  We've got the forward-facing position of the administration in terms of what we've already [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=367.4s)]
*  discussed, you know, no acceleration but deceleration of tensions and attacks here. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  But what are you expecting in that briefing? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=380.44s)]
*  What types of questions do you have still so that you can have a better understanding [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=383.72s)]
*  and clarification on what the U.S. next steps should be? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=389.6s)]
*  And that, again, ties into Simone's question about the types of aid packages that should [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  be going, could be, or should be going forward afterwards. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=398.04s)]
*  So I will say that the administration has been, you know, first in a classified manner, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=401.56s)]
*  keeping me informed on the imminent danger of the attack by Iran, so that they had messaging [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=407.28s)]
*  and we were prepared for it, and that they would be moving certain equipment, et cetera, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  there to make sure that we knocked it down and we defended Israel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=423.64s)]
*  And we've gone back and forth. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=428.12s)]
*  I've been communicating with my colleague, the chair of the committee, Michael McCaul. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=430.08s)]
*  We've been talking on the phone back and forth, trying to make sure, you know, my purpose [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=435.96000000000004s)]
*  is that we are staying on the same page to talk about passing this bipartisan bill that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=440.2s)]
*  came out the Senate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=447.8s)]
*  And so we've been talking in that regard, and we'll continue. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=449.24s)]
*  I hope to have another conversation with him. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  I've been talking to my colleagues on the Democratic side of the committee. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=454.44s)]
*  We've gathered and we've had some meetings and conversations among ourselves, and we've [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=460.12s)]
*  been trying to make sure that we update one another. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=463.02s)]
*  I've been sending out any messages that I'm getting out that's not classified to my colleague [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=467.06s)]
*  so that when we get back to Washington tomorrow, we'll have an opportunity. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=472.5s)]
*  I've requested a meeting, in fact. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=476.86s)]
*  I requested and asked for the opportunity at its earliest convenience to have a classified [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=478.46000000000004s)]
*  meeting with the White House to talk about what has taken place, what they're looking [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=486.46s)]
*  at and where we're going from here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=490.82s)]
*  I think that's important to do. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=493.3s)]
*  And I think that as a result, again, all from all that I have received thus far, I will [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=494.98s)]
*  say again, thank God that the president of the United States is Joseph Biden. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=502.94s)]
*  All right, Congressman Gregory Meeks, thank you very much, sir. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtygS9fkp1Q&t=508.18s)]
