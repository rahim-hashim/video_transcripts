# IDF investigating whether Hamas leader Sinwar was killed
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc)
*  Let's go straight to NBC's Erin McLaughlin in Tel Aviv. Also with us, Jason Beardsley, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=0.0s)]
*  former senior adviser to the Department of Defense and a former Green Beret, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=5.12s)]
*  and with us by phone, former CIA Director John Brennan. Erin, what more are we learning? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=8.96s)]
*  Hey there, Ana. Well, according to a statement released by the Israeli military, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  they're investigating the possibility that Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=23.28s)]
*  was killed during an Israeli military operation in Gaza, according to that statement in an [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=28.159999999999997s)]
*  unspecified location of the Gaza Strip. They say that the Israeli military entered a building, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=34.16s)]
*  and three militants were killed inside of that building, and they're looking at the possibility [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=41.2s)]
*  that one of the militants was, in fact, Yahya Sinwar, although they cannot verify that. It [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  is not confirmed at this point. It is what they are looking at. If confirmed, this is a significant [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=52.48s)]
*  blow to the Hamas terror organization. He's seen as the architect of the October 7th terror attacks, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=61.36s)]
*  worth noting that according to the Israeli military, no Israeli hostages were found [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=69.44s)]
*  in that building where those militants were killed. We heard from Yoav Galant, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=75.44s)]
*  the Israel defense minister on X, tweet, chase the enemy and they will fall upon your sword. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=80.88s)]
*  We will reach every terrorist and eliminate him. We know that Israeli officials have made the death [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=88.64s)]
*  of Yahya Sinwar a priority during this past year of war. We're also hearing from some of the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  relatives of former hostages, Thomas Hand. He is the father of nine-year-old Emily Hand, who was [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=103.28s)]
*  kidnapped from her kibbutz on October 7th, taken to Gaza and released as part of the first [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=110.48s)]
*  hostage deal. He just sent me a text saying, quote, I am hopeful that his personal reign of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=116.0s)]
*  terror has ended. I know that they will have many more to fill his shoes. I hope that this heavy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  blow to their command structure will help bring an end to this terrible war. Perhaps they will [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=127.2s)]
*  feel weakened enough to come to the table and finally make a serious deal to end the war and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=132.4s)]
*  give us back our poor hostages after more than a year in brutal captivity. Again, if this is in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=138.0s)]
*  fact confirmed, Ana, it has significant implications for the Hamas terror organization, for the Israeli [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=145.04s)]
*  hostages, the 101 of them still being held in Gaza, as well as the overall war, not to mention [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=152.72s)]
*  the Palestinian civilians in Gaza right now, Ana. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=159.36s)]
*  Erin McLaughlin, thanks for the reporting. We'll let you go so you can keep working the phones and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=162.16s)]
*  work your sources to get more information here. John Brennan, your thoughts on this statement from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=166.4s)]
*  the IDF. Would Israel put this out there if there was much uncertainty here? What's the likelihood [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=171.52s)]
*  that Sinwar was taken out? Well, Ana, I think that the Gaza Sinwar has been in the Israeli targets [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=177.28s)]
*  for the past year. He has been the priority target because he's been the, not just the architect of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=186.72s)]
*  October 7 massacre, but also the unquestioned military and political leader of Hamas. And if [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=192.56s)]
*  they were able to eliminate him, and again, it's unconfirmed, but he may have been hiding, I don't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=198.88s)]
*  want to say in plain sight, but above ground and not in those tunnels as a way to mask his actual [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=204.8s)]
*  location from the Israelis who were going through those tunnels, believing that the command structure [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=210.88s)]
*  was there. But it would be a significant blow to Hamas. It would further decapitate the organization [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=216.8s)]
*  that has already lost a number of senior leaders. It's not going to lead to the demise of the Hamas [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  militancy and terrorist organization, but it certainly will do a lot to degrade its capabilities [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  as if they'll will be searching for a successor to Sinwar if in fact the Israelis killed him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=241.12s)]
*  Again, if it is confirmed, we want to be very careful as we proceed here. All we're able to, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  at this point, report is that they are looking into the possibility that he is among those killed. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=254.4s)]
*  I'm wondering, John, it's like, you know, cutting off the head of a snake here. We're talking about [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=260.16s)]
*  the leader of this organization, somebody who was called the architect of the October 7 attack, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=263.92s)]
*  but is there someone in your mind that would be the obvious person to take a spot? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=270.4s)]
*  Well, Iyag has assumed not just the military leadership of Hamas and has been basically in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=277.2s)]
*  Gaza for the past several years doing that, but also after the assassination of his male Kamiya, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  to assume the political leadership as well. So there are going to be individuals within Gaza, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  we don't know whether Mohammed Dayouf, who is another senior terrorist within Hamas, is dead or [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=299.12s)]
*  not. So someone I think would try to handle the military terrorist aspects of it. Whether or not [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=303.92s)]
*  there's going to be somebody within the organization that has a more moderate cast to them, and that's [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=311.6s)]
*  a very relative term when you talk about Hamas. Whether or not there's going to be someone who [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=318.24s)]
*  can emerge to take on the political leadership, the ones that can in fact maybe negotiate a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=322.24s)]
*  ceasefire, as maybe Israel sees this now as nearly a death blow if Sinwar is killed. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=328.8s)]
*  Then they tried to revive those ceasefire discussions, believing now that they're in [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=335.92s)]
*  a much better position as a result of a possible Sinwar death. Jason, how do you see it? If Sinwar [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=341.36s)]
*  was killed, what does it mean for this war? Well, I think the director's got a lot of this right in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=348.56s)]
*  that this may provide an opportunity or an opening for further discussions and negotiations. And we [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=354.64s)]
*  should keep in mind the broader context here is not really just Hamas, but it's Iran. It's Hezbollah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=360.88s)]
*  It's the proxies of Iran that have been waging war against the United States and Israel for a [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=366.24s)]
*  significant amount of time, and in fact putting our own U.S. service members in jeopardy. And I [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=371.36s)]
*  represent Concerned Veterans for America who have seen this firsthand with injured soldiers coming [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=376.48s)]
*  back from Iraq and Syria. So the real question is, can the United States in our own foreign policy [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=381.68s)]
*  strategy leverage diplomacy, economic sanctions, the things that are necessary to get Iran to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=386.88s)]
*  contain these proxies, whether it's Hamas or whether it's Hezbollah or the Houthis in Yemen? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=394.16s)]
*  And part of that will again provide an opening because Israel has decimated the leadership [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  structure of these proxies, and now there is some opportunities for change to take place. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=404.96s)]
*  But it has to be recognized that behind all these proxies and behind this escalating war that's been [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=411.28s)]
*  going on, you have a nation state that has a lot of belligerence and is called for the destruction [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=417.68s)]
*  of another nation state. So this is a good opportunity, but as Director Brennan points [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=423.35999999999996s)]
*  out, it's not the end. You can take out certain leaderships. They will have follow-on, but right [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=429.12s)]
*  now is a time to move, and I think the White House is going to be very potentially pleased with the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=434.0s)]
*  opportunity to maybe change the table now. So Jason, if Sinwar is gone and removed from the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=440.32s)]
*  organization of Hamas, who is leading it at this point? Does that mean Hamas is much weaker? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=446.24s)]
*  Certainly, but not just because Sinwar's potential death here, but because the entire infrastructure [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=452.4s)]
*  has been at war, at a war footing since they opened up the attack on October 7th last year. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=460.16s)]
*  And so they've been hiding. Their leadership has been decimated. Hezbollah's leadership has been [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=466.48s)]
*  decimated. In Iran, those who are driving these proxies are now also looking at how do we save [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  face? How do we contain this? But the containment really is gone. At this point, Israel is inside [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=478.08000000000004s)]
*  the territories, and they're systematically operating through the leadership levels of this [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=484.24s)]
*  military political establishment. So yes, it is very effective. And to be honest, if you're looking [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=489.6s)]
*  at emerging leadership, they have to be thinking the same thing until this situation changes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=495.92s)]
*  In the grand scheme, in other words, until people sit down and talk about how an end of this conflict [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=501.44s)]
*  looks, if you're stepping into leadership in any one of these Iranian proxies, you're next on the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=506.48s)]
*  target list. And that has been demonstrated in the last four weeks pretty significantly. So I [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=513.12s)]
*  would say that this is a pretty significant change if it's happened. And we're learning the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=518.4s)]
*  president has now been briefed on the possible death again of Yahya Sinwar in Gaza. John, the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=521.92s)]
*  National Security Council says it's deferring to the Israelis on this matter. What kind of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=526.72s)]
*  intelligence gathering would you expect to be underway right now? How are they going to make [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=532.4s)]
*  this confirmation? The Israelis have a lot of information on Yahya Sinwar, his DNA from his [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=536.0s)]
*  many years in prison within Israel. So I think that that DNA is going to be dispositive of whether [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=547.52s)]
*  or not that is Sinwar who was killed in that operation. But also they're going to be looking [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=553.36s)]
*  at what activities are going to be taking place inside of Hamas as they react to the possible [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=559.68s)]
*  death of Sinwar to see whether or not they have the sources, whether it be technical or human, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=566.88s)]
*  to give them some insight into who might in fact step into Yahya's shoes. Because even though they [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=573.12s)]
*  may see this as opportunity, I agree with Jason that I think the Netanyahu government will see [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=580.88s)]
*  if they can capitalize on this some way to bring the fighting, the violence, the budget to an end. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=585.44s)]
*  And also the overwhelming majority of Palestinians want this fighting to stop. But they have to be, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=591.12s)]
*  Israelis have to be mindful that there are a lot of mutants still in Gaza, especially those that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  feel quite aggrieved and angry over the 43,000 or so possibly to have been killed as a result of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=605.04s)]
*  the Israeli military operations. But I'm hoping, as others are, that if in fact this news is true, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  that both sides, and it is going to be dependent on whether or not Iran is going to allow at least [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  some breathing space here to see whether or not negotiations can move forward to get those hostages [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=628.16s)]
*  back to have a ceasefire and to see whether or not we can move forward in some positive way in Gaza [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=633.92s)]
*  despite the challenges of Iran. Yep. You remind us, John, that Israel had Sinwar in their custody [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=640.16s)]
*  back in the 80s when they arrested him. He was then released in 2011 as part of an exchange, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  was negotiated by Netanyahu. I'm wondering how quickly they would be able to then use his DNA [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=653.6s)]
*  that they have already to make this confirmation. How quick could they turn this around? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, once they get the body back and they do the analysis, you can make that confirmation [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=666.24s)]
*  very quickly. So I expect some time within the next several hours. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=671.44s)]
*  And therefore, I think the Israelis will make the announcement, which is they've [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=678.32s)]
*  come out with a statement about his possible death. I think they will confirm one way or another [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=682.24s)]
*  whether or not Sinwar is dead or alive. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnbwN-oxQCc&t=687.04s)]
