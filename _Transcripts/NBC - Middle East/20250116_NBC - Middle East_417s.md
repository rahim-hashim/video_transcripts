# 'We're dealing with the worst terrorist group’: Parents of American-Israeli hostage killed by Hamas
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw)
*  21-year-old New York native was serving as an Israeli soldier when he was killed by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=0.0s)]
*  Terrible news that his family only found out about last month. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=7.0s)]
*  Joining me now are his parents Orna and Ronan Neutra. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=10.0s)]
*  Ronan, Orna, it's good to see you again. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=14.0s)]
*  It's always good to see you and talk to you, but you must have a lot of mixed feelings going into this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=19.0s)]
*  What is for some people a celebration and for you as well to at some point be getting him back so that he can return home for a proper burial. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=25.0s)]
*  Orna? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=36.0s)]
*  It's Ryan Andrea. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=38.0s)]
*  You know, for 422 days we believed Omer was alive and we were fighting for his life and to reunite with him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=40.0s)]
*  And about six weeks ago we were notified that he was killed on October 7th. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=50.0s)]
*  And at that time, you know, we were questioning whether this had all been in vain. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=56.0s)]
*  And we don't believe so. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=61.0s)]
*  I think, you know, we were a part of a group that was advocating for the hostages that hopefully will get to see the hostages back. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=64.0s)]
*  And of course, Omer has not been returned to us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=74.0s)]
*  So Hamas has been holding on to them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=77.0s)]
*  But even so, you know, we've been waiting for this deal for over a year. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=80.0s)]
*  And the feelings are mixed regardless. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=85.0s)]
*  I think as you previously discussed, it's a very fragile deal. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=91.0s)]
*  And even if Omer was alive, I think this is a time of a lot of anxiety, a lot of anticipation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=96.0s)]
*  But also a lot of anxiety. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=105.0s)]
*  It's mixed emotions and for us for sure. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=107.0s)]
*  And we would need to hold tight to get him back and hold all the parties accountable throughout the phases of the deal to see Omer back and give him a proper burial. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=110.0s)]
*  I know, Orna and Ronan, you are so balanced and so empathetic for the others. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=122.0s)]
*  Ronan, you must be feeling also, as some of your colleagues have told me, you know, other families, that there's some stress and pain involved and that they will not be returned in the initial group because this thing could fall apart at any minute. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=133.0s)]
*  Yeah, it took such a long time to try and reach this moment. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=152.0s)]
*  You know, we're extremely thankful for the Biden administration, for all the people in his administration that did so many efforts to try and bring us to this moment. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=159.0s)]
*  We know that after the election, we asked the National Security Advisor team to work hand in hand with the incoming Trump team, which President Biden is the president of the United States. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=170.0s)]
*  President Biden promised us that that's the case. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=188.0s)]
*  And he met President Trump in the White House a few hours after the meeting we met and he told us that that's exactly what's going to happen. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=192.0s)]
*  And he did. They all worked hand in hand. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=202.0s)]
*  We know that Steve Witkoff has been multiple times in Qatar, working together with Bret McGurk. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=205.0s)]
*  And we're very appreciative for that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=213.0s)]
*  But all hands on deck. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=215.0s)]
*  This is a very sensitive time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=218.0s)]
*  We have to hold everybody accountable, including the mediators, Israel and of course Hamas, and start to get the first phase going. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=221.0s)]
*  And then shortly after it starts, we have to make sure that the following stages are being negotiated. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=234.0s)]
*  We shouldn't wait. We shouldn't hesitate. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=241.0s)]
*  Once it starts, we need to bring everybody out because it's so fragile and we want to get our son back. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=244.0s)]
*  He was fighting. He was a first responder that rushed to the border to try and defend Israel from this major attack where 1200 people were murdered, among them 45 Americans. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=252.0s)]
*  And we have to make sure that his death is not in vain and that we bring him to proper burial and respect him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=266.0s)]
*  Who takes bodies as negotiation chips? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=275.0s)]
*  I mean, really, we're dealing with the worst terrorist group that just acts so brutally, not only with our people, even with our own people. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=279.0s)]
*  But this is the deal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=291.0s)]
*  This is the deal. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=294.0s)]
*  It's a deal with the devil and we have to do it and to bring the 98 people and their families some relief. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=295.0s)]
*  And I know that the families have been invited by the inaugural committee to come to Washington to be here on Monday. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=303.0s)]
*  Were you planning to come? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=310.0s)]
*  Yes, we're expecting to be there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=314.0s)]
*  We think it's really important to remain visible, to make sure that the issue is kept front and center. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=316.0s)]
*  It's not a done deal by any means. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=324.0s)]
*  Andrea, you know, we've been saying that our life has been stuck since October 7th and it's been a nightmare and it's a prolonged nightmare. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=327.0s)]
*  And until the last hostage is home, the nightmare will not be over. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=337.0s)]
*  And, you know, there can't be any healing or closure. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=342.0s)]
*  You know, it's like an open wound. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=347.0s)]
*  And we're not there yet. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=350.0s)]
*  So the hostage families will be wearing a yellow scarf. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=353.0s)]
*  You're welcome to look for us. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=357.0s)]
*  Happy to see you there. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=358.0s)]
*  And yes, we want to be visible. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=359.0s)]
*  We want to meet all the incoming members of the Trump team and make sure that the effort will continue and will bring the crisis to an end. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=362.0s)]
*  Well, Oana and Ronan, you know, we were together on Capitol Hill. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=377.0s)]
*  We spent a lot of time together in Israel and here over these last 15 months. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=382.0s)]
*  And we will continue. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=388.0s)]
*  And we're grateful for your support. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=390.0s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=393.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=394.0s)]
*  Thank you for your coverage. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=395.0s)]
*  And thank you for standing with us. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=397.0s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6WG2hxpgw&t=398.0s)]
