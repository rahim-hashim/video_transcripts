# ‘We have very little influence’ over Israel despite Biden admin. efforts: Ret. Admiral Stavridis
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw)
*  Joining me now, retired Admiral James Tavides, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander and author-author [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=0.0s)]
*  of the new book, a novel, The Restless Wave. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=6.48s)]
*  Congratulations on the book. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=9.36s)]
*  I can't wait to read it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=10.88s)]
*  Admiral Tavides, you write in Bloomberg, quote, that the potential for a wider kinetic conflict [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=12.76s)]
*  hasn't been greater in decades. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  We're certainly seeing it, feeling it, and the U.S. doesn't seem to have any real influence [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=21.48s)]
*  over what Israel will do. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=27.52s)]
*  I think we have very limited influence at this point, unfortunately. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=31.16s)]
*  And you see that the Biden administration has tried so hard, and I give them great credit [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  to try and get to a ceasefire in Gaza to try and encourage another ceasefire with Hezbollah [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=41.4s)]
*  to try and encourage the Israelis to take another measured response. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=47.32s)]
*  I just don't see that happening at this point. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=53.16s)]
*  Israel is going to hit back and hit back hard, and then the ball will be in the Iranian [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=56.96s)]
*  court to see if this thing does turn into a wider war. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=62.84s)]
*  It's very worrisome, Andrea. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=66.72s)]
*  Well, Iran says that they will retaliate, so then you have tit for tat, tit for tat, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=68.76s)]
*  and by definition, you could end up in a wider war. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=74.32s)]
*  Do we know what Netanyahu's endgame is? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=77.52s)]
*  Is it to take out—I'm not sure they could not take out the nuclear program without U.S. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=80.58s)]
*  help, which the U.S. has said is not forthcoming, but they can ding it, they can do things to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=87.78s)]
*  slow them down in terms of attacking some of those sites, even if they don't get the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=94.62s)]
*  underground fortresses? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=101.74s)]
*  Yeah, your analysis is spot on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=103.38s)]
*  I think there's three big potential target sets here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=106.66s)]
*  You mentioned the nuclear sites. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=110.02s)]
*  The problem with that is very hard targets, 25 locations scattered across Iran, which, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=112.06s)]
*  by the way, is three times the size of Texas. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=119.78s)]
*  Number two set of targets would be the military-industrial complex. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=124.62s)]
*  Here I'd go particularly after the ballistic missile production facilities. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=130.14s)]
*  That would be quite proportional to the attack that they received from Iranian ballistic [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=135.04s)]
*  missiles. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=139.92s)]
*  And number three, the energy facilities go at the economic heart of Iran. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=140.92s)]
*  I think that's the conversation occurring in Jerusalem right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=146.48s)]
*  Nobody knows which way Prime Minister Netanyahu will ultimately decide, but I think it's quite [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=150.88s)]
*  clear this is not going to be a light tap on the brakes to Iran. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=157.56s)]
*  It'll be a significant strike. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=162.04s)]
*  I would bet on him going after the military-industrial complex, can't rule out an attempt at the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=163.96s)]
*  nuclear or at the energy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=170.12s)]
*  And if it is the energy sector, as we were just discussing earlier here with Douglas [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=173.4s)]
*  Holtz-Eakin and Mike Froman, there's a lot of overcapacity right now in energy, and the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=179.12s)]
*  U.S. and Saudis are prepared to ramp up production if they need to, but it still is destabilizing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=183.84s)]
*  Is the U.S. military prepared to protect and perhaps escort ships through the Strait of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=190.4s)]
*  Hormuz, for instance? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  That's the key question. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=198.8s)]
*  There is plenty of additional capacity to make up for whatever gets taken off the table [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=200.08s)]
*  by strikes against the Iranians. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=205.94000000000003s)]
*  The worry is that Iran would then turn around and try to close the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  Andrea, they'd do that with mines, they'd do it with small boats, they'd do it with [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=215.2s)]
*  cruise missiles, potentially use submarines, particularly in the deep water at the far [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=220.44s)]
*  end of the strait. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  They have options. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=227.44s)]
*  Could we stop them? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  Ultimately, yes, but it would drag the United States and our allies directly into confrontation [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=238.12s)]
*  Boy, let's hope we don't end up going there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=239.12s)]
*  And final thought, we had this exact scenario in the 1980s when young Lieutenant Commander [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=242.52s)]
*  Stavridis was on a Navy cruiser. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=249.8s)]
*  The Iranians know those waters well. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  If they tried to close them, there goes 35 percent of the world's oil. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't care how much overcapacity there is in the system. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=261.0s)]
*  Oil prices will go well above 100 a barrel at that stage. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=264.76s)]
*  One top official here told me last night that President Biden is basically in a political [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=269.24s)]
*  straitjacket at this point in the campaign, not being the candidate and not having leverage [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=274.44s)]
*  with Netanyahu and not really being able to put pressure on Israel. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=279.12s)]
*  I think that's unfortunately a fair point to be made. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=285.68s)]
*  What he does have is some pretty good lieutenants out there, if you will. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=290.6s)]
*  Secretary of State Tony Blinken, director of the CIA, Bill Burns, Jake Sullivan, national [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=296.12s)]
*  security adviser, very experienced former general Lloyd Austin over at the Pentagon. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=302.16s)]
*  He's got some strong players in those cabinet posts. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=308.12s)]
*  He'll deploy them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=311.96s)]
*  He'll try and control events as best he can. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=312.96s)]
*  But as you and I agreed at the start, not a lot of real direct influence the U.S. can [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=315.76s)]
*  bring to bear here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=322.52s)]
*  Admiral Stavridis, thank you very much, and congratulations on the book. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjg40UU8nZw&t=323.76s)]
