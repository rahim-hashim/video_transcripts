# Israeli ground operation in Lebanon appears to have begun, U.S. officials say
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU)
*  Breaking news out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. officials are confirming to NBC News that they have the view that it appears an [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=1.52s)]
*  Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon has just begun. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=5.2s)]
*  Israeli officials had said to the U.S. that the incursion would be limited in scope, scale [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=9.24s)]
*  and duration. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=14.68s)]
*  That's their account. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=15.68s)]
*  U.S. officials say, so far, that is what they are seeing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=16.68s)]
*  This is days after Israeli airstrikes killed the longtime leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=19.8s)]
*  We are joined now by David Rothkopf, a foreign policy expert who has worked in the Clinton [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  administration, also writes about foreign policy for The Daily Beast in his newsletter. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=28.72s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=33.16s)]
*  What do you understand is happening at this hour? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=34.4s)]
*  Well, as I understand it, Israeli forces are beginning to expand their operations in Lebanon [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  somewhat. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=44.28s)]
*  The United States government is concerned about this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=45.28s)]
*  That President Biden said earlier today that he is still hoping for a ceasefire. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  And I think the concern of U.S. officials with whom I've spoken is not that this will [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  be a limited operation, as the Israelis promised, but instead that they will get bogged down, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  that civilian casualties will rise, as often happens in this kind of thing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=70.04s)]
*  The conflict between Israel, Lebanon and Hezbollah forces is long running and long predates the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=76.36s)]
*  October 7th attack and the war in Gaza. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=83.72s)]
*  But after October 7th, there was an escalation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=88.36s)]
*  How should American audiences understand sort of the link between these two conflicts or [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=91.44s)]
*  wars? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=96.96s)]
*  Well, Hamas and Hezbollah are both organizations that are tied to Iran, funded by Iran. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=97.96s)]
*  They're linked to the Houthis, who are also tied to Iran and Yemen, and to other Iranian [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  proxies throughout the region. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=113.8s)]
*  When Israel went into Gaza after October 7th, Hezbollah immediately started launching attacks [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=116.76s)]
*  into northern Israel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  This has caused many Israelis to be dislocated from their positions, and the Israelis have [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=127.28s)]
*  found this intolerable. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=132.84s)]
*  I think if you're a viewer and you say, well, the Israelis have conducted surgical strikes [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=134.68s)]
*  that have eliminated terrorists, that's probably net a good thing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=141.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=146.0s)]
*  The question is, when this gets expanded, when you send ground troops in, what is the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=147.0s)]
*  impact on the civilian population of Lebanon, which is much greater? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=153.88s)]
*  And earlier today, for example, the head of UNICEF said that it is starting to see big [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=159.12s)]
*  dislocations of people in Lebanon, perhaps a million people dislocated. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  And so we're entering a very, very tricky phase of this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=171.56s)]
*  I think the U.S. will be pushing for ceasefire. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  I think the Israelis will not be listening. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  And to the extent to which this goes beyond the kind of surgical strikes that we've seen [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=183.36s)]
*  recently, I think international opinion will quickly turn against the Israelis. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVZ-pFZj_wU&t=189.68s)]
