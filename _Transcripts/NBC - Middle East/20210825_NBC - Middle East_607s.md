# Taliban Vows 'Consequences' If U.S. Troops Don't Leave Region
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE)
*  All right, now to Afghanistan. President Biden says the U.S. is on pace to finish the removal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=0.0s)]
*  of U.S. citizens and troops from Afghanistan by the August 31st deadline. The White House [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=6.16s)]
*  says approximately 12,000 people were evacuated from Kabul yesterday alone. More than 70,000 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  have been airlifted out since August 14th. Seventy thousand people. The number of evacuations has [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=19.68s)]
*  picked up in recent days, even outpacing the goal set by President Biden earlier in the month of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=27.36s)]
*  five to nine thousand per day. It is unclear, however, how many Americans and Afghans who [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=34.4s)]
*  worked with the U.S. government are still there. We have two reports now from Peter Alexander at [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=41.04s)]
*  the White House and Richard Engel in Kabul. With a frantic rush to evacuate stranded Americans and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=48.0s)]
*  desperate Afghans and despite pleas from U.S. allies at a G7 meeting this morning to stay longer, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=55.44s)]
*  President Biden is sticking with his self-imposed August 31st deadline for U.S. forces to leave [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=61.44s)]
*  Afghanistan. We are currently on a pace to finish by August the 31st. The sooner we can finish, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=67.12s)]
*  the better. It follows a secret meeting Monday in Afghanistan between CIA Director William Burns [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=73.84s)]
*  and a top Taliban leader who previously spent eight years in prison after being arrested by [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=79.52s)]
*  the CIA. After the meeting, the Taliban declaring the U.S. must go by the end of the month as [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=84.8s)]
*  promised, threatening consequences if not. The president's saying he's asked for contingency [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=90.0s)]
*  plans to stay longer if needed, but that he's worried about a terror attack there. I'm also [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=95.28s)]
*  mindful of the increasing risk that I've been briefed on. Every day we're on the ground. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=100.0s)]
*  There's another day we know that ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport. U.S. officials tell NBC News [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=108.16s)]
*  4,000 Americans and their families have been evacuated from Afghanistan, but thousands more [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=114.0s)]
*  remain trapped. The U.S. is still relying on the Taliban to allow safe passage for Americans to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=118.88s)]
*  the airport that the State Department warns is a dangerous trip, and the Taliban is now vowing to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=124.0s)]
*  block Afghans from leaving. The White House says evacuations have accelerated 12,000 people in the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=129.12s)]
*  last 12 hours, but a top Democrat argues it's very unlikely the U.S. will be able to get all Americans [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=134.88s)]
*  and Afghan allies out in seven days. It's hard for me to imagine all of that can be accomplished [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=140.88s)]
*  between now and the end of the month. Republicans slamming President Biden for the chaotic withdrawal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=147.12s)]
*  Particularly after the decision made today and what we heard today, he will have blood on his [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=152.16s)]
*  hands. People are going to die and they're going to be left behind. Meanwhile, Afghan refugees [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=157.84s)]
*  arriving in the U.S. are detailing their terrifying exit from Kabul, saying people died in the chaotic [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=163.04s)]
*  crush trying to get to the airport. Yeah, the children were dying because there were many people [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=168.48s)]
*  they were pushing that they have to get to the flight, yes to the terminal. At Kabul International [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  Airport, time is running out. The U.S. and NATO allies have just one week to pull out all their [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=181.2s)]
*  citizens and vulnerable Afghans after the Taliban again insisted they'd accept no extensions beyond [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=187.44s)]
*  August 31st or there'd be consequences. The U.S. embassy apparently feeling the strain, issuing a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=194.24s)]
*  final alert for American citizens to leave or they'd be on their own, then recalling it 30 minutes [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=201.36s)]
*  later. This is now an extremely busy airfield. Every few minutes new planes are coming in and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  they are not just from the United States. We've seen them from the U.K., Qatar, Australia, civilian [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  aircraft. This is a truly global airlift. These satellite images show the huge crowds trying to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=220.64s)]
*  leave the airport, but now finally the departures are going smoothly. We watched a Qatari Air Force [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=228.32s)]
*  plane bound for Doha being loaded as U.S. forces monitor air traffic from the runway, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  but will the airlift be done in a week? Maybe, but it will be difficult because U.S. troops don't [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=240.72s)]
*  just need to fly out Afghans, but also themselves. So we just left Kabul airport and you go through [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=246.8s)]
*  the American checkpoint and then you're handed over to what looks like another American checkpoint. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  You see American uniforms, you see soldiers in black jackets, eye protection, new weapons, M4s, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=260.16s)]
*  perfect condition. They know how to carry them, but they're not American soldiers. They're the Taliban. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=269.76s)]
*  The images are hard to believe that this is how the United States is ending its longest war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=276.8s)]
*  American troops just yards from the Taliban helping the U.S. get out and go home. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=283.36s)]
*  The Taliban are now on almost every corner in Kabul. They weren't hostile to us or anyone we [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  saw. The Taliban claim to have found tolerance since they were in power two decades ago. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  The old tri-colored Afghan flag still flies and Kabul for now is calm. Traffic cops from the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=302.88s)]
*  deposed U.S.-backed government have returned to work. The Taliban move among them and they're [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=310.32s)]
*  giving the orders. There's an old Taliban expression that the Americans have the watches and they have [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=315.84s)]
*  the time. It seems they were right and the Americans' time is about to run out. Let's bring [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=321.76s)]
*  in the Washington editor at Aussie media, Cady Kay, and also the president of Council of Foreign [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=329.2s)]
*  Relations, Richard Haas, and also former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, retired four-star Navy [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=332.88s)]
*  Admiral James Stavridis. He's the chief international security and diplomacy analyst for [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=338.0s)]
*  NBC News and MSNBC. So Admiral, let me just ask you, get your input about where we are right now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=345.12s)]
*  I, of course, was very critical of us removing 2,500 troops from the ground, agreed that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=351.84s)]
*  to get the air base, sending more troops. And this evacuation, we're at 70,000. I mean, it is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=359.76s)]
*  one of the most extraordinary airlifts, I think, since Berlin. I am starting to get a sense, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=369.52s)]
*  and this is just as a layman, and I'm curious what you're thinking about. I'm starting to get a sense [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=376.88s)]
*  of getting worried about the law of diminishing returns. I want to get everybody else out that we [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  can get out. I certainly want to get every last American out of there. But it seems to me, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=388.64s)]
*  if we stayed past the end of the month, we would just be inviting an attack by ISIS, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  inviting an attack by, let's say, an even more radical element of the Taliban. This is the sort [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=401.44s)]
*  of thing. I would not want our troops sitting there indefinitely in this sort of situation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=407.36s)]
*  And I'm just curious, since you actually know what you're talking about, our audience would [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=414.4s)]
*  probably like to know what your thoughts are on this situation unfolding. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=419.68s)]
*  Yeah, Joe, I think you've walked through the exact calculus that's going on in the Pentagon [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=424.88s)]
*  and the White House. And by the way, just off the top, can we all stop for one second, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=429.76s)]
*  think about those reporters on the ground in Kabul and the reporting they're doing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=434.32s)]
*  My friend Richard Engel, I say to all of them, thank you for your service, as the saying goes. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=439.76s)]
*  So to the military side of things, it's like the Rolling Stone song. You can't always get what you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  want. You've got to kind of work your way through things. And contrary to popular belief that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=452.24s)]
*  militaries exist to destroy things, sometimes they do. But the real job is to bring order out [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=458.4s)]
*  of chaos. And that's what you've seen at the Kabul airport. The challenge now is not getting [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=465.76s)]
*  people out of the airport. It's still going to be getting people into the airport. Having said all [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=471.76s)]
*  that, we say in the military, in the Navy in particular, the mark of a good ship handler [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=477.28s)]
*  is never getting in a situation that requires great ship handling. Fortunately, yes, the military [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=483.68s)]
*  has shown some extraordinary skill here over the last couple of weeks ramping up these efforts. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=490.64s)]
*  But I am very worried we are one C-17 crash, one big bomb, one firefight at the KIA corral [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=496.8s)]
*  away from this thing turning sideways. So bottom line, let's get this thing done. Let's get out of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  here. If we still have people on the ground, we ought to try and extend that deadline. But I think [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=514.0s)]
*  it's like COVID diminishing returns kind of kicking in here. Let's get what we can. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=521.44s)]
*  Get it done. Get out. Richard, I'll take the same question to you. This is obviously, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=528.56s)]
*  this is something that you and I opposed strongly. Here we are, though. We are where we are. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=534.16s)]
*  We have, again, 70,000 people already airlifted out. We have until the end of the month. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=544.0s)]
*  I suspect that number will get close to 100,000. We must get every American out that we can get out. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=549.84s)]
*  But I'm curious if you're starting to have the same concerns that the longer we stay there, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=558.88s)]
*  the longer we're inviting an attack by ISIS, the longer we're inviting an attack by radical, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=564.48s)]
*  the most radical elements of the Taliban. Yeah, we're essentially a concentrated target there. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=571.04s)]
*  So there's that. The Taliban controls access to the airport. That we can't change. So we can [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=576.88s)]
*  only fly out as many people who can get in. Hey, thanks so much for watching our YouTube channel. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgdSzQKHZE&t=583.68s)]
