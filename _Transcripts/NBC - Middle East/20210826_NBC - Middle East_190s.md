# Rep. Garamendi Reacts To The Attack Outside Of Kabul's Airport
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8)
*  So, let me ask you this. When it comes to trusting the Taliban, and I guess that's a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=0.0s)]
*  strong word, they got to earn it over time. But do you think we have no other choice but [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  to give the Taliban some opportunity here to show that they can get control? Do we use [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  the frozen assets as a way for them to get tough and not allow an al-Qaeda or an ISIS [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=19.52s)]
*  to sort of get safe harbor? Clearly, this ISIS K has some safe harbor here. How much [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=28.0s)]
*  do we attempt to work with the Taliban here versus against them? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, we really will have no choice but to work with the Taliban as long as they are [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=39.84s)]
*  in apparent control of Kabul and other major cities. Now, what leverage do we have? I suspect [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=45.2s)]
*  there are many, and it may very well be best for the United States to work through an international [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  organization like the United Nations and to recognize that we're not the only player in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=57.2s)]
*  this game. Clearly, the countries that are surrounding Afghanistan have a major and a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=65.12s)]
*  critical stake in what the future will hold and will undoubtedly be in touch with the Taliban, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=71.12s)]
*  as we are, trying to sort out what needs to be done there. The Taliban face an awesome [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  and very, very difficult and dangerous situation of their own. They're not loved by everybody. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=86.8s)]
*  In fact, they were hated and they were involved in fights, revenge killings, and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=93.52s)]
*  power conflicts are going on as we speak. All of those things create a very unstable situation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=100.64s)]
*  So right now for the United States, it's to get us, get all of our people out, as the president [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=109.12s)]
*  says, those who want to get out and as many of those people that helped us over the last 20 years. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=114.64s)]
*  That's our goal. And then to extract the American military safely. Obviously, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=121.04s)]
*  American military personnel have lost their life. And so the safety issue is even more [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=128.32s)]
*  on the minds of all of us. So it's going to be complex. The president needs all of our support [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=135.12s)]
*  as he works through a very difficult situation that actually began long before he became president. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=142.24s)]
*  And the stage was set for a tragedy. And here we are, the tragedy that all of us feared. The [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  president very clearly feared this happening. And now where do we go from here? We be as safe [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=158.8s)]
*  as we possibly can for the military and try to get the Americans out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2ZCGa-zs8&t=165.44s)]
