# What do Democrats need to do to win? 'Wake up every day and attack Trump': Ex-GOP strategist
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s)
*  Meantime, the former president, Barack Obama, has a stark warning for America that our system, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=0.0s)]
*  quote, is captured by those who have a weak attachment to democracy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=6.32s)]
*  Delivering the message at an event in Hartford, Connecticut this week, he cautioned about [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=11.78s)]
*  what happens when we lose sight of upholding the Constitution. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=15.92s)]
*  We start drifting into something that is not consistent with American democracy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=21.64s)]
*  It is consistent with autocracies. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=30.76s)]
*  We're not there yet, completely, but I think that we are dangerously close to normalizing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=33.36s)]
*  behavior like that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=48.72s)]
*  Jonathan Capehart is back with us, also with us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=50.76s)]
*  Stuart Stevens, senior advisor for the Lincoln Project, chief strategist for Mitt Romney's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=53.48s)]
*  2012 presidential campaign. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=57.96s)]
*  Basil Smichael is professor of practice at Columbia University School of Professional [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=60.0s)]
*  Studies and an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=64.12s)]
*  So Jonathan, let me play some more of what President Obama said about democracy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=67.32s)]
*  Our biggest challenge right now is we need democracy and social cohesion and trust more [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=74.12s)]
*  than ever, and it's probably as weak as it's been since I've been alive. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=82.28s)]
*  And that's a bad combination. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Jonathan, you've covered Obama closely for a long time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=99.4s)]
*  You know how very carefully he chooses his words, pausing sometimes, as he just did. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=102.76s)]
*  So why this message and why now? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=109.44s)]
*  Well quite honestly, Chris, what the former president has been saying has been consistent [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  since his farewell address on January 10th of 2017. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=119.0s)]
*  His concerns about democracy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=123.42s)]
*  Remember, the person who succeeded him in the White House when he left was Donald Trump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=125.56s)]
*  And so now here we are in the second Trump administration, a second Trump tour in the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=131.84s)]
*  White House, and all the things that the former president, President Obama, said in 2017 on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=136.8s)]
*  January 10th have only expanded, have only grown those concerns. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=143.52s)]
*  And so he has been very consistent about what he's saying. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=150.08s)]
*  The one thing he hasn't done that has been very frustrating to a lot of Democrats, and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  Chris, it drives me insane, is that, to your point, he doesn't come out there all the time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=161.52s)]
*  He is not in our faces all the time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=168.52s)]
*  And when he does come out, we pay attention simply because of that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=170.44s)]
*  That I also think, Chris, we lose sight of the fact that President Obama doesn't pop [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=175.12s)]
*  out there like Punxsutawney Phil. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=180.26000000000002s)]
*  It's because when he left the White House, he told everybody, and I'm quoting, I'm asking [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=183.22s)]
*  you to believe, meaning in democracy, in the country, not in my ability to bring about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=189.94s)]
*  change, but in yours. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=195.98s)]
*  When he left the White House, he wanted people to understand that the progress that the country [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=198.8s)]
*  had made up until that point in his presidency wasn't just about him. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=203.9s)]
*  It was because of them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=208.84s)]
*  And he told them, if you are upset about something, put on your shoes, knock on some doors, run [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=210.82s)]
*  for office yourself. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=216.2s)]
*  He has been saying that consistently since he left the White House. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=217.74s)]
*  And why Democrats don't listen to him and take his advice and look to themselves for [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=221.94s)]
*  the leadership and the power that they're looking for from him is beyond me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=228.74s)]
*  Well, I wonder also the fact, Basil, that he never names Trump, didn't name Trump during [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=234.58s)]
*  that hour-long conversation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=241.5s)]
*  He seems to be following the norms, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=244.26000000000002s)]
*  The norm has always been, you don't criticize the sitting president as a former president, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=246.1s)]
*  right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  Maybe there is a message here that sometimes the old ways are better. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  Norms are in place for a reason. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=257.34s)]
*  Well, you know, he's still, if not one of the most effective communicator that Democrats [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=258.98s)]
*  have had. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=263.98s)]
*  But I really want to lean on one of Jonathan's points, because it's really important, that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=264.98s)]
*  when he was president, he got elected sort of going around the Democratic Party, kind [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  of created Obama for America, which was proprietary for him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=274.76000000000005s)]
*  So what I think a lot of Democrats are saying is that where are the coattails? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=279.6s)]
*  Where is the infrastructure that helped you? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  How can it help us? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's really the change in our politics, sort of on the left. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=287.8s)]
*  But there are plenty of Democrats, and maybe you've been one of them, who has suggested [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  you can't look backwards and use what worked a dozen years ago or 16 years ago or however [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=295.92s)]
*  long it was. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=303.52s)]
*  He was first elected and apply that to 2026 or 2028. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=304.52s)]
*  I absolutely agree with that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  But I do think that there's something important about the structure, the infrastructure of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  a party that gets elected, everyone from the sheriff of a county to president of the United [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=316.2s)]
*  States. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=322.84s)]
*  There's something that people believe is a pathway to political and economic empowerment [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=323.84s)]
*  that could be had through the party. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=329.41999999999996s)]
*  The reason that to me that's important is because also another part of what Obama said [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  was that liberals may have gotten too complacent. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  He said that in his remarks. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  He said that we may have gotten too comfortable in believing that the things that we believed [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=342.04s)]
*  and the way in which we won these elections, we can go off and now be comfortable in going [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=348.72s)]
*  on our vacations and doing those things. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=353.32000000000005s)]
*  We need to actually go out and work. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  Let me play that, and I'll get your reaction on the other side. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=356.56s)]
*  You could be as progressive and socially conscious as you wanted and you did not have to pay [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  a price. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=367.48s)]
*  You could still make a lot of money and have a house in the Hamptons and still be and still [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  think of yourself as a progressive. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  And now things are a little different. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=383.8s)]
*  We now have a situation in which all of us are going to be tested in some way. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=386.24s)]
*  And we are going to have to then decide what our commitments are. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=393.08s)]
*  I talk about this all the time. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=397.16s)]
*  That it really does, it really, and Jonathan also made this point, it really comes down [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=400.48s)]
*  not just to what's happening in DC and not just about where you think the party should [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=405.2s)]
*  go but what are you doing in your communities to move the needle. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=409.92s)]
*  And that's one of the things where I do think if we can't spend so much time talking about [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=415.24s)]
*  whether or not Obama has coattails, those days are gone. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=420.2s)]
*  We can't so much speak about whether the party itself is broken because that actually could [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=423.2s)]
*  be fixed and we need to focus on that too. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=427.64s)]
*  But we also need to pay attention on giving people locally the tools, the weapons to be [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  able to fight back. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=436.24s)]
*  So I have spent countless weekends on the campaign trail with state legislative candidates, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=437.24s)]
*  with local candidates who have long complained to me about the fact that they're fighting [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=444.84s)]
*  an uphill battle without help from the party. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=450.96s)]
*  So Stuart, while Obama is sounding the alarm about democracy, the New York Times reports [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=455.2s)]
*  that the DNC is in chaos, that they're desperate for cash. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=460.08s)]
*  They say Obama is headlining a DNC fundraiser next month at the home of New Jersey Governor [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=463.88s)]
*  Phil Murphy. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=470.12s)]
*  Is this a sign of the state of the Democratic Party? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=471.55999999999995s)]
*  The top messenger and fundraiser is somebody who hasn't been in office for nearly a decade. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=473.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think the biggest problem with the Democratic Party is they ought to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  shut up about the Democratic Party. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=483.88s)]
*  I mean, I really don't understand this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=485.8s)]
*  They're like a bunch of doctors. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=487.88s)]
*  They have a patient walk into the emergency room with a nail in his head and they're having [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=489.28s)]
*  a focus group about why the guy has a headache. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=492.28s)]
*  Look, you have the most dangerous president that has existed certainly since the Civil [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=494.68s)]
*  War. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=499.84s)]
*  We have a situation here where it's obvious what they should do. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  They should wake up every day and attack Trump and attack Trumpism. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  We have an international crisis which a bunch of idiots and stooges advising the president [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=511.8s)]
*  of the United States, who is himself an idiot and a stooge. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=517.08s)]
*  Why do you have to have focus groups to talk about this? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=520.24s)]
*  And the idea that there's some message that's going to work here. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=523.48s)]
*  The days where you could have a campaign and say, OK, we're going to have an education [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=527.72s)]
*  week. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=531.28s)]
*  We're going to have a jobs week. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=532.28s)]
*  Those days really never worked, the truth, back when. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=534.52s)]
*  We pretended they did. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=537.6s)]
*  But there is no reason to have one message from the Democratic Party. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=539.04s)]
*  Well, it shouldn't be. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=543.0799999999999s)]
*  But you need a special. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you something very specifically because we just were in the White House press [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  briefing. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=547.92s)]
*  Do they need to be more in the moment? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=548.92s)]
*  For example, I'm thinking about the Economist YouGov poll that came out today. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  Should the U.S. get involved in the Iran-Israeli conflict? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  And Trump supporters, 19 percent say yes, 53 percent say no. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=560.76s)]
*  Not to talk about that in those terms, is that a missed opportunity? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=569.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think that you should talk about what people are talking about. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=573.3599999999999s)]
*  And the point here is who is advising the president of the United States? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=579.0s)]
*  You know, Pete Hedges said you have this fight inside the Republican Party with the Tucker [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=584.0s)]
*  Carlson wing, whatever the heck that is, and these people. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=590.16s)]
*  I mean, you have Laura Loomer picking national security people. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=593.56s)]
*  This is a disgrace. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=597.7199999999999s)]
*  This is incredibly dangerous. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's what you ought to be talking about. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=601.12s)]
*  You shouldn't shy away from this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=603.28s)]
*  I don't think that you can vote for Pete Hedges as Secretary of Defense and call yourself [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=605.48s)]
*  a patriot. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=609.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  And I think they ought to be saying that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=611.7199999999999s)]
*  They should be out there attacking the Republican Party. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=613.24s)]
*  And people follow passion. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=616.76s)]
*  They follow conviction. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=618.92s)]
*  Why is it that all those people are out there with AOC and Bernie? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=621.84s)]
*  It's not because they agree with AOC and Bernie, because, I mean, whatever the heck that is. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=624.52s)]
*  I mean, Bernie's to the right of the Republican Party on foreign policy now. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=629.16s)]
*  It's because they believe in something and they're out there being passionate. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=633.52s)]
*  And that's what the party needs to do. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=637.92s)]
*  And I think people will follow that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=639.68s)]
*  There's a distinct need for it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=641.96s)]
*  And the Republican Party is the party in crisis, not the Democratic Party. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  You lost an election. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  OK, that happens. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  But look at what is happening to the country. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=652.16s)]
*  Nothing that Donald Trump ran on is happening. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=654.2399999999999s)]
*  You know, if I say eggs hasn't gone down, it didn't end the Ukraine War. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=655.92s)]
*  We now have elected officials being arrested. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=660.8s)]
*  We've reached a point where we have masked men demanding papers from American citizens. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  Have they have focus groups about what to talk about? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=672.24s)]
*  No, just go out there and say it and let everybody say it in a different way. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=674.84s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=678.6800000000001s)]
*  Speak to your different constituencies. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  But, you know, run to the sound of the guns. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=682.12s)]
*  Don't debate whether or not those are guns going off. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp0KMBi_-s&t=684.5600000000001s)]
