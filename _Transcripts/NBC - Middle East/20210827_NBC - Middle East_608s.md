# Retired Navy Admiral Says The U.S. Needs To ‘Coordinate With The Taliban’
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc)
*  Our hearts go out to all those who we've lost. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=0.0s)]
*  But, look, the mission there, being performed, is dangerous. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=6.0s)]
*  And it's now come with a significant loss of American personnel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=12.0s)]
*  But it's a worthy mission, because they continue to evacuate folks out of that region, out of the airport. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=20.0s)]
*  They've evacuated more than 12,000 additional people out of the airport in the last 24 hours. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=28.0s)]
*  I met with my commanders this morning, first thing in the morning, got a detailed briefing about yesterday's attacks and the measures they're taking to protect our forces and complete the mission. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=36.0s)]
*  And we will complete the mission. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=46.0s)]
*  Hi, everyone. It's 5 o'clock in the east. I'm Jason Johnson in for Nicole Wallace. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=50.0s)]
*  Joe Biden today having to confront new challenges of his presidency as he recognizes yesterday's horrible attack in Kabul amid warnings that another is likely as a president laid out many times his motivation for ending America's involvement in Afghanistan was to prevent any more U.S. military deaths and America's longest war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=55.0s)]
*  But yesterday, 13 U.S. service members were killed and 18 injured from a suicide bombing at Kabul's airport. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=75.0s)]
*  Over 100 Afghans died as well over the past two days. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=81.0s)]
*  The commander in chief has voiced sympathy for the hero's loss and vowed retribution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=85.0s)]
*  The Washington Post reports on the significance of yesterday's attack for President Biden. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=90.0s)]
*  Quote, the killings clearly marked a pivotal moment in Biden's presidency and an episode that is likely to be part of his legacy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=95.0s)]
*  Biden keeps a tally of U.S. service members who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan on a card in his breast pocket. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=102.0s)]
*  And now for the first time, that tally will include some who lost their lives on his watch. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=108.0s)]
*  In addition to the strategic security and humanitarian challenges ahead for this administration, Michael Sheer in the New York Times writes about the possible political consequences. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=114.0s)]
*  Quote, America's tumultuous exit from Afghanistan has dragged down Mr. Biden's approval ratings. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=124.0s)]
*  And the bombings on Thursday surely will open him up to political criticism. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=130.0s)]
*  But it was unclear what the damage would be to his presidency in the long term as he exits a war that most Americans want out of as well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=134.0s)]
*  Right now, the administration is navigating a surge of criticism from lawmakers, which heightened in the wake of yesterday's attack. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=142.0s)]
*  Some Republicans even gone so far as to say Biden should resign. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=149.0s)]
*  But Eugene Robinson in the Washington Post poses a question, quote, How exactly did the Biden administration's critics think U.S. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=153.0s)]
*  military involvement in Afghanistan was ever going to end? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=160.0s)]
*  Robinson continues, quote, Certainly not like this is not a valid answer. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=163.0s)]
*  However tragic Thursday's attacks near the Kabul airport proved to be. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=168.0s)]
*  Please be specific. Did you envision a formal ceremony at the U.S. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=172.0s)]
*  embassy with the American flag being lowered and the Taliban flag being raised? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=176.0s)]
*  Did you see the Taliban waiting patiently while the U.S. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=180.0s)]
*  trained Afghan army escorted U.S. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=183.0s)]
*  citizens, other NATO nationals and our Afghan collaborators to the airport for evacuation? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=185.0s)]
*  Did you imagine that the country's branch of the Islamic State would watch peacefully from the sidelines? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=190.0s)]
*  This is not an apology for the tragic and chaotic scenes that have been unfolding in Kabul. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=195.0s)]
*  Rather, it is a reality check. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=201.0s)]
*  If there is a graceful, orderly way to abandon involvement in a brutal, unresolved civil war on the other side of the world, please cite historical precedents, because I can't find them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=203.0s)]
*  And that's where we begin this hour. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=214.0s)]
*  Joining us now, retired retired Admiral James Stavridis, former Supreme Allied Commander at NATO and now MSNBC's chief international security and diplomacy analyst. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=216.0s)]
*  Also with us, Jeremy Butler, a Navy veteran and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and NBC News Pentagon correspondent Courtney Kubi. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=226.0s)]
*  Courtney, I'll start with you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=235.0s)]
*  We're getting information. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=239.0s)]
*  What are we hearing out of the Pentagon, out of the White House now about the possibility of further attacks? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=240.0s)]
*  There are still people being evacuated from the country. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=246.0s)]
*  We're still searching for people who need to be evacuated. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=248.0s)]
*  What's the likelihood of another one of these attacks? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=251.0s)]
*  So the U.S. has credible and specific intelligence about another potential attack, very similar to the one we saw yesterday, Jason. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=253.0s)]
*  So there are three main lines of concern that the U.S. is watching for. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=260.0s)]
*  One is another suicide attack, just like what we saw yesterday at the Abbey Gate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=265.0s)]
*  And in this case, it's someone who straps explosives to him or herself and is able to walk near or even onto Hamid Karzai International Airport and detonate. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=270.0s)]
*  Yesterday, not only was it a suicide attack, the reason that the military kept referring to it as a complex attack is because it involved more than one location or more than one in this case, more than one means of attack. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=281.0s)]
*  So after the suicide attack, there was also an ensuing gunfight. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=293.0s)]
*  Another concern, though, is the reality or the possibility of a vehicle borne explosive device. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=297.0s)]
*  Now, this would be a vehicle that would be packed with explosives. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=304.0s)]
*  And the real concern is that somebody would be able to drive it onto Hamid Karzai Airport and detonate. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=308.0s)]
*  The third one is the threat from a rocket attack. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=313.0s)]
*  Now, this could come in two forms. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=317.0s)]
*  One would be that they would launch rockets, that they would land on the airfield, park up the runway and stop or slow the evacuation efforts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=319.0s)]
*  But a larger concern is that they would target a U.S. aircraft, particularly in this case, a charter aircraft with evacuees potentially injuring or killing hundreds of people on board. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=327.0s)]
*  The U.S. military aircraft, of course, have some methods that they might be able to stop or deter that kind of an attack. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=339.0s)]
*  But there's so many charter aircraft coming that that's coming and going that that's one of the real concerns here. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=345.0s)]
*  And again, what's important to point out, we are now hearing from U.S. military officials that this is a specific line, a specific and credible threat. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=351.0s)]
*  And it is continuing, Jason. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=360.0s)]
*  Goodness gracious. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=362.0s)]
*  Look, we recently got the breakdown of the 13 service members killed in action yesterday. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=364.0s)]
*  Eleven Marines, one Navy corpsman and one soldier. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=369.0s)]
*  Are there any details we're hearing either about the lives lost yesterday or any additional information about the attack that you can share with us today? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=372.0s)]
*  No, I mean, the one new thing that we found out today is that there was rather than two explosions, explosions, there was one at the Abbey Gate. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=379.0s)]
*  There was not a second one at the Barrett Hotel, which is right nearby. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=387.0s)]
*  You know, you can kind of chalk this up to the fog of war and the chaos that ensues after one of these attacks that there's reports that end up, you know, the first reports that come in, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=391.0s)]
*  end up generally have not always been completely right. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=400.0s)]
*  So there was one explosion, but there was gunfire afterwards. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=403.0s)]
*  We don't have a really good sense of what it was that killed so many of the civilians because remember, there were dozens of Afghan civilians injured and killed in this attack as well. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=407.0s)]
*  We don't really know if it was the initial explosion or the ensuing gunfight that caused more of the people here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=417.0s)]
*  But we can tell you that there was a large loss of life. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=423.0s)]
*  One of the big questions that we've been trying to find out is exactly how many were there so many U.S. military casualties here because it wasn't just the 13 who were killed. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=426.0s)]
*  There were also at least 18 injured. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=435.0s)]
*  That's a huge number of casualties at one location. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=438.0s)]
*  And it may be that, again, it wasn't just the initial blast, but the gunfight that that followed. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=441.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, NBC's Courtney Kubi. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=449.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for starting off our show today. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=451.0s)]
*  I want to go straight to you, Admiral Stavridis. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=454.0s)]
*  How can we protect our soldiers? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=457.0s)]
*  How can we better protect our evacuees? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=461.0s)]
*  This is going to be a difficult process regardless. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=464.0s)]
*  And we don't want to get into a situation where we're sending more troops into Afghanistan to help people out. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=467.0s)]
*  But what's the best way to keep these evacuations going smoothly and safely in the wake of what are likely going to be future attacks? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=472.0s)]
*  Number one, talk to the commanders on the ground. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=480.0s)]
*  They're out walking the perimeter constantly. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=482.0s)]
*  They're checking in with their troops. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=485.0s)]
*  Get the people who are on the ground. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=487.0s)]
*  Ask them what they need. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=489.0s)]
*  I assure you that is exactly what the Pentagon is doing now. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=491.0s)]
*  And whatever the commanders need in terms of technology or if they do need specialized assistance, all that can be provided even in these remaining few days. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=495.0s)]
*  Secondly, distasteful, but you've got to continue to coordinate with the Taliban. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=507.0s)]
*  The reality of this terrible situation is that we are hemmed in and we have to depend on the Taliban for at least initial contact with all those who want to come in. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=513.0s)]
*  And we want to continue that process right up till the very last minute. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=526.0s)]
*  Thirdly, intelligence. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=531.0s)]
*  I need to focus with our intelligence community. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=533.0s)]
*  The eyes of the United States are on this zone right now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=536.0s)]
*  Every asset we have, satellites, drones, our manned networks, if you will, the CIA, all that intelligence has to flow in there. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=540.0s)]
*  Those are kind of the three key stones. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=551.0s)]
*  But all of it, you know, I'm with Courtney here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=554.0s)]
*  There are so many different scenarios. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=558.0s)]
*  We know the Islamic State tends to come in waves when they attack. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=560.0s)]
*  I'm very concerned about somebody going after an aircraft or perhaps even using a truck bomb from inside the airport, fuel trucks that move all around that airport civilian side to the military side. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=565.0s)]
*  It's going to be a very dicey few days. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=580.0s)]
*  Let's all keep our troops and our evacuees in our thoughts and prayers. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=582.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOpDVtPctVc&t=590.0s)]
