# Rep. Colin Allred On Afghanistan's 'Speed Of Collapse'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M)
*  In just a few minutes, the House will be back in session, cutting short a break that was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=0.0s)]
*  supposed to last until next month. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  And while Congress has many things to take care of now that they're re-adjourned, one [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=6.84s)]
*  of the main priorities has become investigating just what happened in Afghanistan over the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  last few weeks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=15.52s)]
*  Both Democrats and Republicans are committed to getting to the bottom of the fallout. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=17.06s)]
*  The House Intelligence Committee will get a classified briefing from members of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=21.52s)]
*  intelligence community at the top of the next hour, with the full House briefed in-person [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=24.88s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=29.84s)]
*  Congressman Colin Allred is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=30.84s)]
*  He has been watching the situation unfold in 2019. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=33.76s)]
*  He questioned Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the Trump administration's deal [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=36.4s)]
*  with the Taliban could very well unfold into what we are seeing today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=40.84s)]
*  I share the recognition that we're not going to have a military solution to Afghanistan. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=46.8s)]
*  My concern is if we have a precipitous withdrawal and that we pull out without the correct conditions [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=52.0s)]
*  in place. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=57.36s)]
*  So are we also caving to the Taliban's stance that the Afghan government is an illegitimate [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=58.36s)]
*  puppet of the U.S.? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=62.26s)]
*  Because that's what they have said previously. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Our conditions previously have been that they should be part of the Afghan government. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=65.44s)]
*  Is this funny, sir? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=69.12s)]
*  Yeah, the fact that you're relying on third-hand reporting for something that the Taliban might [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=70.12s)]
*  or might not have actually said in some print report, yeah, I think we should all have better [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=74.64s)]
*  information. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=78.6s)]
*  Is the Afghan government actively part of this negotiation that we're having? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=79.6s)]
*  We speak, Ambassador Bas talks to President Ghani multiple times every week, multiple [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=81.84s)]
*  times every day on some days. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=88.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=90.68s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressman Colin Allred of Texas, member of the Foreign Affairs and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=91.68s)]
*  Veterans Affairs Committee. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=94.94s)]
*  Congressman, you voiced your concern to Pompeo last year during the briefing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=96.44s)]
*  We just watched that clip. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=100.44s)]
*  What were your concerns then and what are they now? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=102.16s)]
*  Well, my concerns were that the previous U.S. conditions, which was to respect the Afghan [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=105.0s)]
*  constitution, including its protections for women and girls and minorities, as well as [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=110.36s)]
*  not having the Afghan government a part of the negotiations with the Taliban, which had [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=116.64s)]
*  previously been a condition of ours, that those had been dropped and that it seemed [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  to me that they're trying to just fulfill a political promise and to try to get out [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  as quickly as possible, leaving, I think, a very difficult situation for the next president. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=128.68s)]
*  What does it look like at this point to get things right from here on out? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=133.88s)]
*  Well, we have to continue to evacuate every Afghan who worked with us, every Afghan who [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=139.72s)]
*  is a part of our 20-year occupation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  Their lives are literally at risk. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  And we have to continue to apply international pressure to the Taliban to respect some of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=149.08s)]
*  the commitments that they have made about how they're going to govern their own people. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=153.8s)]
*  They now are at a crossroads in which they can either go back to being a pariah in the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=157.28s)]
*  world community, a pariah in which they will not have any funding sources, will they be [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  subject to all kinds of sanctions, or in which they could have potentially some kind [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=166.04s)]
*  of constructive relationship if they can take care of their people and respect some of the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=170.48s)]
*  things and some of the progress that has been made in Afghanistan over the last couple of decades. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=174.76s)]
*  Big intel briefing tonight. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=178.6s)]
*  What do you hope to get from that briefing? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=180.12s)]
*  What questions do you have? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, my biggest question is around the speed of the collapse of the Afghan security forces [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=183.28s)]
*  and about some of the deals that were clearly in place between the Taliban and some of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=189.0s)]
*  regional leaders who handed over their population centers without a fight. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=193.88s)]
*  There was clearly months of negotiations, maybe payoffs that were going on, so that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=198.24s)]
*  once this all started, it collapsed extremely quickly. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=202.96s)]
*  That was not something that happened overnight, and it wasn't a military victory even. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=206.32s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  So much of the concerns and legitimate concerns that we see at the airport now are driven [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=212.0s)]
*  by the speed of the collapse because no one thought this was going to happen in 11 days. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLsE-waY2_M&t=217.24s)]
