# Engel: U.S. Forced To Leave on 'Taliban's Clock' Is 'Moment Of Humiliation'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA)
*  What are you seeing in Kabul since you've gotten back? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=0.0s)]
*  And is this tradeoff we've made with the Taliban essentially providing safe passage for Americans? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Have we traded away the possibility of getting Afghans who helped us out by garnering the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=9.76s)]
*  support of the Taliban to help get Americans out? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  A lot of this depends on the will of the Taliban. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=19.72s)]
*  And do you believe that the Taliban have changed? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=25.28s)]
*  The Taliban are now on their best behavior. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=27.48s)]
*  They are saying that they will support an inclusive society. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Police are back on the streets here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=34.4s)]
*  They are leaving the old Afghan flag in place. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=36.72s)]
*  They have not gone in and looted or ransacked the U.S. embassy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=39.64s)]
*  They are talking about building an inclusive society. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=45.08s)]
*  They say they need the engineers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=48.32s)]
*  They need the doctors. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=49.82s)]
*  They're calling on Afghans to stay. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=51.16s)]
*  They say that the previous president, Ashraf Ghani, who left in, you know, fled the country, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=54.56s)]
*  that that caused panic and that caused a rush on the airport. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=61.28s)]
*  And they're trying to stop that wound, that outward flow from this country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=64.9s)]
*  So if you believe the Taliban and the Taliban are telling their people that they have reassurances, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=70.92s)]
*  they're saying we want the Americans to leave, but this does not mean that others can't leave, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  that the commercial airport will one day open. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=80.08000000000001s)]
*  They want the Americans out and they are doing what they can to make sure that the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=82.92s)]
*  Americans do leave. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  And that goes down to coordinating on a tactical level, operating security checkpoints right [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=88.98s)]
*  next to the Americans. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=94.68s)]
*  So on a tactical standpoint, sticking to the August 31st deadline makes a lot of sense [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=96.1s)]
*  here in Kabul, because if you lose the Taliban's cooperation, the Taliban could not necessarily, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=103.36s)]
*  although it's possible, step up violence, but more likely just unleash people toward [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=110.12s)]
*  the airport, stop cooperating completely, overwhelm the Americans' process, have that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  process break down. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  But then if you step back and you look at what is going on, this is the United States [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=121.2s)]
*  after 20 years. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=126.4s)]
*  This war used to be called Operation Enduring Freedom, and it's turned out not to be enduring [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  and they're not leaving behind a society that is free. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=135.16s)]
*  It is only free according to what the Taliban says it will be free. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=138.56s)]
*  The Taliban promises that it will be free. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=142.52s)]
*  So you could also look at this as a tremendously humiliating moment of American humiliation, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=144.82000000000002s)]
*  leaving, forced to leave on the Taliban's clock and with the Taliban's good graces. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=151.56s)]
*  So tactically it makes sense, but I'm not sure how history will, I think history will [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  judge this moment as a very dark period for the United States. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=163.10000000000002s)]
*  So Richard, pragmatically, the U.S. has Afghan allies that they want to get out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=167.44s)]
*  The Taliban says no more Afghans are leaving. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=172.98s)]
*  How does, right now, before August 31st, can American soldiers figure out how to get Afghan [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=175.66s)]
*  allies out, or is that done? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=180.92s)]
*  Well, there's a little bit of confusion. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=186.72s)]
*  Today the Taliban gave a press conference and they said in Pashto that people can't [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=188.72s)]
*  leave, that the airport road is closed, but then when it was translated to English they [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=195.68s)]
*  said they are discouraging Afghans from going to the airport. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=199.5s)]
*  So it's not exactly clear that they are shutting the tap entirely. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=203.36s)]
*  They are still coordinating with Americans, so if there are specific names it seems like [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=208.08s)]
*  they are willing to cooperate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=212.38s)]
*  They want this process to move ahead. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=215.36s)]
*  They want to do whatever is possible to get this going. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=218.26s)]
*  And I believe it was Kelly saying earlier, if there is a terrorist attack that could [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=221.44s)]
*  slow it down. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=225.68s)]
*  The Taliban don't want that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=226.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=227.68s)]
*  They don't want some ISIS fanatic to go in and set up a car bomb in the middle of this [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=228.68s)]
*  and slow it down days and days. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=232.84s)]
*  There are Taliban patrols all over this city. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=234.88s)]
*  It's hard to go a block and not see a Taliban patrol or a Taliban checkpoint. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=239.24s)]
*  They've been friendly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=245.08s)]
*  When I went through them today, they saw me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=246.4s)]
*  Clearly not a Taliban member. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=248.96s)]
*  They looked at me, waved us on through. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=251.8s)]
*  It's not an issue. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  They want this to go as smoothly as possible because of their endgame. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  They want to take this country for themselves. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=259.32s)]
*  And they are promising it will be free. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=261.76s)]
*  But a lot of Afghans now have to take them at their word. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  And when that door closes, they will be dependent on going through the commercial airport if [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=267.08s)]
*  that can get open. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ5h2nKi0pA&t=271.12s)]
