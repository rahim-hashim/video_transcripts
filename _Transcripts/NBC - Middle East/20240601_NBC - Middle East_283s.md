Video Description: Since the war in Gaza began in October, Israeli forces have issued evacuation orders to Palestinian civilians, telling them to move south. Over 1 million people ended up in Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city. But last week, 45 people were killed after an Israeli airstrike sparked a fire that tore through one of Rafah’s tent camps. Ali Velshi takes a look at how Rafah went from a refuge for the displaced to a target of the Israeli military.

# How Rafah became a refuge for displaced Palestinians & now an IDF target
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA)
*  You've heard a lot recently about an Israeli military ground assault into Rafa. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been mulling it for months and the international community has warned against it for just as long, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=4.58s)]
*  which is why the story of how we got here is very, very complicated and we're gonna walk through it together. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=11.22s)]
*  Before October 7th and the war that followed, around [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=16.98s)]
*  275,000 people lived in the city of Rafa, but like everything in Gaza, it's geographically pretty small. At [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=20.68s)]
*  25 square miles, Rafa is roughly the size of Newark, New Jersey or Arlington, Virginia. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=27.84s)]
*  Since October 7th, Rafa has become central to many of our conversations around Israel's war in Gaza for more reasons than one. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=32.88s)]
*  Rafa is situated on the Egyptian border, so when Israel's assault on Gaza began, the Rafa border crossing was the only path for food, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=40.2s)]
*  medical supplies, and fuel to enter Gaza. And for some wounded Palestinians and foreign citizens, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  it was a way out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=53.76s)]
*  More than a million Palestinians in Gaza have fled south to Rafa after being warned to go there by the Israeli government to avoid being attacked. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=55.04s)]
*  And now the Israeli government plans to attack the very place it told Palestinians they would be safe. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  So let's take a look at how it all happened. On October 7th, Hamas [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=67.56s)]
*  infiltrated Israel's borders and killed 1,200 Israelis and took about 240 hostages. By our latest count, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=71.28s)]
*  121 hostages still remain in Gaza. By October 13th, Israel was preparing its large-scale military response. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=78.08s)]
*  Invade Gaza, eliminate Hamas, and rescue the hostages. Israeli military planes distributed leaflets above [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=85.52s)]
*  Gaza City in the north with the message, move south for your own safety. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=92.24s)]
*  Many Palestinians sought refuge in the city of Khan Yunis, which is one of the largest cities in southern Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=97.36s)]
*  The IDF then bombarded Gaza City, leveling its buildings and killing hundreds of civilians. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=103.44s)]
*  But over the next several weeks, the Israeli military also continued to move south toward Khan Yunis. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=109.0s)]
*  On December 1st, the IDF began its assault on Khan Yunis. On December 2nd, the Israeli Defense Forces spokesman [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  posted on X urging Palestinians to quote, go to the known shelter centers in Rafa for their safety. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=123.8s)]
*  This is the first time to our knowledge that Israel told Palestinians to seek safety specifically in Rafa. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=131.4s)]
*  By February, Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military to begin planning an offensive in Rafa, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=138.52s)]
*  which he said was necessary to eliminate Hamas and free the remaining hostages. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=144.24s)]
*  President Biden urged him not to do so. He did it again on a phone call in March. At this point, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=149.0s)]
*  30,000 people had been killed in Gaza. On April 9th, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=154.88s)]
*  Israeli forces withdrew from Khan Yunis. Some Palestinians left Rafa to return to Khan Yunis, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=159.4s)]
*  but found only rubble saved for some unexploded munitions. So they returned south to Rafa. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  At this point, 1.4 million people, half of Gaza's entire population, were sheltering in Rafa. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=171.24s)]
*  Then on May 6th, leaflets were dropped over Rafa, urging civilians to evacuate. Within hours, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  Israel began launching strikes toward eastern Rafa, where it said Hamas was hiding out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=186.12s)]
*  Two days later, on May 8th, the Biden administration paused a shipment of weapons [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  that was meant for Israel over concerns regarding Rafa. Which brings us to last week on May 26th, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=195.72s)]
*  when an Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people who were sheltering in tents in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=202.2s)]
*  Rafa. Netanyahu described the strike as a tragic mishap, according to NBC News' translation, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  although the Prime Minister's office insisted afterward that the translation of what he said [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=214.44s)]
*  was a tragic incident. Analysis from both the New York Times and the Washington Post found that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=218.68s)]
*  munitions debris filmed at the scene of this attack was designed and manufactured in the United [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=223.88s)]
*  States. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said on Wednesday that the United States could not [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=229.32s)]
*  confirm which weapons were used or how they were used in the strike. Let me leave you with one more, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=234.12s)]
*  a couple more dates if I may. On March 10th, President Biden said right here on MSNBC that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=239.96s)]
*  an invasion of Rafa would be a red line. This week on May 29, three days after the Israeli [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=245.08s)]
*  airstrike sparked that fire, which killed dozens of Palestinians at the camp in Rafa, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=251.4s)]
*  the Biden administration said that those very actions did not cross the president's red line. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=256.2s)]
*  you [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukHixYj-hA&t=269.72s)]
