# Why Trump's Gaza talk 'flies in the face of how Trump views foreign policy'
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok)
*  We're going to start this morning with President Trump's brazen proposal for Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=0.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the president announced the United States should seek control of the enclave [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=5.32s)]
*  and that the nearly two million Palestinians living there should relocate to Egypt or Jordan, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=11.0s)]
*  a move both countries have vehemently opposed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=17.0s)]
*  The president made the comment during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=21.2s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=25.32s)]
*  The two leaders met at the White House yesterday and it comes as negotiators are discussing [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=27.2s)]
*  the next phase of the Israel Hamas ceasefire agreement, which is supposed to include more [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=32.08s)]
*  humanitarian aid and reconstruction supplies for the people of Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=38.2s)]
*  We should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts and there are many [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=44.04s)]
*  of them that want to do this and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and frankly [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=55.36s)]
*  bad luck. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=62.0s)]
*  This can be paid for by neighboring countries of great wealth. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=63.92s)]
*  It could be one, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, twelve. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=67.44s)]
*  It could be numerous sites or it could be one large site, but the people will be able [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=72.12s)]
*  to live in comfort and peace. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=76.68s)]
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=86.16s)]
*  other weapons on the site. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=91.44s)]
*  Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=93.72s)]
*  development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=99.48s)]
*  I envision the world, people living there, the world's people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=107.64s)]
*  I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=112.92s)]
*  I think the potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable and I think the entire world, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  representatives from all over the world will be there and they'll live there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=123.48s)]
*  Palestinians also, Palestinians will live there, many people will live there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=128.04s)]
*  We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal and I don't want to be [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=133.04s)]
*  cute, I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=138.92s)]
*  something that could be so magnificent. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=143.0s)]
*  Trump's comments have sent shockwaves throughout the region and here at home. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry said its stance on the establishment [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=155.04s)]
*  of a Palestinian state remains a firm, unwavering position. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=160.92s)]
*  Hamas released a statement rejecting Trump's plans, calling his comments a recipe for creating [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=165.84s)]
*  chaos and tension in the region. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, NBC News caught up with several senators yesterday to ask them about what [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=175.28s)]
*  the president said. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=180.32s)]
*  At first I heard of it, I said, it seems like there's a few kinks in that slinky, we'll [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=181.32s)]
*  see what he meant. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=186.88s)]
*  What do you mean by kinks in that slinky? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=187.88s)]
*  I don't know if you know about a slinky, but if it kinks you can't use it anymore. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=189.88s)]
*  I don't know how it would play out if what he said or what you all have said, I haven't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=194.4s)]
*  seen the first-hand account, but obviously that's not going to happen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=199.64s)]
*  I think that'd be a tough place to be assigned if you're an American soldier. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=204.88s)]
*  So, we'll see what the Arab world says, but you know, that'd be problematic at many, many levels. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=208.88s)]
*  I'm speechless, that's insane. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=216.88s)]
*  I can't think of a place on Earth that would welcome American troops less and where any [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=219.88s)]
*  positive outcome is less likely and why on Earth we would abandon decades of well-established [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=226.88s)]
*  humanitarian programs around the world and now launch into one of the world's greatest [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=233.88s)]
*  humanitarian challenges. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=238.88s)]
*  I mean, A, we don't, yes, the United States should not take anybody's home. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=241.88s)]
*  Number two, us nation-building in the Middle East, if you haven't learned anything from [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=247.88s)]
*  2001 to 2025, you haven't been paying attention. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=254.88s)]
*  We are very bad at that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=258.88s)]
*  All right, some bipartisan condemnation there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=261.88s)]
*  Jonathan Lumiere, your latest reporting for The Atlantic references Senator Graham's response. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=264.88s)]
*  It's entitled Trump's Wild Plan for Gaza. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=269.88s)]
*  And you write in part this, any direct U.S. intervention in Gaza would fly in the face [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=272.88s)]
*  of Trump's long-standing desire to disengage from foreign entanglements. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=277.88s)]
*  He began negotiations to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, wants to slash aid to Ukraine, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=282.88s)]
*  and has threatened to abandon military positions in Korea, Europe, and Syria. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=288.88s)]
*  And it may face pushback at home from some usually reliable allies. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=293.88s)]
*  I think that would be an interesting proposal, Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Capitol [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=298.88s)]
*  Hill after Trump spoke. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=302.88s)]
*  We'll see what our Arab friends say about that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=304.88s)]
*  I think most South Carolinians would probably not be excited about sending Americans to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=306.88s)]
*  take over Gaza. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=312.88s)]
*  It might be problematic. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=313.88s)]
*  And Jonathan Lumiere, Tom Telles, I think, had the quote of the day, a few kinks in the slinky. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=315.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a new one. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=323.88s)]
*  I'm not aware of that particular phrase, but it does, but it works. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=324.88s)]
*  We'll run with it this morning. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=327.88s)]
*  But yeah, it is a breathtakingly audacious proposal here from Donald Trump, one that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=328.88s)]
*  was indeed met with a lot of pushback immediately. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=334.88s)]
*  First, as noted, this flies in the face of how Trump views foreign policy. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=337.88s)]
*  He wants to pull back U.S. engagement. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=341.88s)]
*  And yesterday he was asked repeatedly whether or not U.S. troops would be sent to Gaza to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=344.88s)]
*  help secure it while it's being rebuilt. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=350.88s)]
*  He did not rule that out. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=352.88s)]
*  This, of course, is a conflict that has been in Gaza. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=355.88s)]
*  There's decades in the making, contested land since Israel's creation in 1948. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=358.88s)]
*  This is the first time a U.S. president has suggested something like this with the U.S. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=363.88s)]
*  being an occupying force. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=367.88s)]
*  We have seen that Saudi Arabia, as you just said already, which is seemingly close to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=370.88s)]
*  normalizing relations with Israel, has already said, we're not going to do this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=375.88s)]
*  And that is just a preview of what is expected to be the reaction from throughout the Arab [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=378.88s)]
*  world who want to see the Palestinians get their own state, who don't want to be taking [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=382.88s)]
*  Palestinian refugees into their own country, who don't want to hand Israel potentially [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=387.88s)]
*  that territory. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=392.88s)]
*  It's certainly a significant win for Prime Minister Netanyahu, were this to happen. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=393.88s)]
*  The right-wing elements in his coalition want to move in both on Gaza and, of course, the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=397.88s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=402.88s)]
*  And we also, this is Donald Trump, the White House aide told me last night, who does feel [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=404.88s)]
*  emboldened with a swagger, if you will, in this second term, believing that he could get a [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=410.88s)]
*  big deal done. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=415.88s)]
*  Few would be bigger than this, even though part of this might even be a real estate transaction, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=417.88s)]
*  something that he has considered in the past, talking about Gaza's beachfront property, even [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=422.88s)]
*  the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=427.88s)]
*  For much, much more on this, let's bring in President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=429.88s)]
*  Relations, Richard Haass. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=434.88s)]
*  Richard Haass is author of the weekly newsletter, Home and Away, which is, of course, available [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=436.88s)]
*  on Substack, as well as retired CIA officer Mark Palmaropoulos. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=441.88s)]
*  He is an NBC News security and intelligence analyst. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=445.88s)]
*  Richard, let's start with you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=449.88s)]
*  I mean, your reaction, it is hard to know at a time how seriously to take this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=451.88s)]
*  Is this something, is Donald Trump actually suggesting sending military troops to the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=457.88s)]
*  Gaza Strip or is this the beginning of some sort of negotiation, an extreme position, if you [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=461.88s)]
*  will, perhaps to apply pressure on the region, allows him to maybe dial it back a little bit to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=467.88s)]
*  get something done? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=473.88s)]
*  But even that seems so far-fetched. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=475.88s)]
*  It seems far-fetched. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=477.88s)]
*  We're all used to the idea of an opening bid. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=479.88s)]
*  And so one of my first reactions was to try to play this out. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=481.88s)]
*  Where could this lead? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=483.88s)]
*  You've got, for example, the King of Jordan showing up in Washington in a few days. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=485.88s)]
*  One of the biggest dangers is that Donald Trump actually tries to follow this up, puts enormous [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=488.88s)]
*  pressure on countries like Jordan, which are already vulnerable, threatens to remove, what, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=493.88s)]
*  the $1.7 billion in aid. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=498.88s)]
*  So I worry that this is a nonstarter. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=500.88s)]
*  Let me just say that with the Palestinians, Jonathan. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=502.88s)]
*  Let's just posit that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=504.88s)]
*  This is going to be unacceptable to the Palestinians. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=506.88s)]
*  The question is, is there a follow-up? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=508.88s)]
*  Does this cause crises in Jordan? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=511.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=513.88s)]
*  Does this cause crises in Egypt? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=515.88s)]
*  Does this cause crises in Israel? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=517.88s)]
*  You know, it's one thing to think big about the Middle East. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=519.88s)]
*  When I thought the Trump administration might think big about the Middle East, I assumed [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=521.88s)]
*  it was to maybe press Bibi to go in the direction of some type of a Palestinian state, which, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=525.88s)]
*  among other things, would bring the Saudis on board and so forth. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=530.88s)]
*  This is thinking big, but in a way that's totally at odds with the history and political [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=534.88s)]
*  realities of the region. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=540.88s)]
*  So it makes me think, one, what you mentioned, the swagger. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=541.88s)]
*  As though history doesn't matter. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=544.88s)]
*  I think there's a little bit of that here, that in a sense that Donald Trump is not bounded [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=547.88s)]
*  by history. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=552.88s)]
*  And also, it raises fundamental questions, and you're closer to it than I am, as is Ali, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=553.88s)]
*  about the policy process. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=558.88s)]
*  You could not have a rigorous policy process filled with experts on the Middle East and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=559.88s)]
*  come up with this proposal. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=565.88s)]
*  There is no way you could get from there to where we now are. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=566.88s)]
*  And, Miki, as we see these images here of the devastation in Gaza, 15 months of conflict, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=569.88s)]
*  but this is still home to 2.2 million people, and Donald Trump is talking about displacement [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=574.88s)]
*  on just a staggering scale. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=580.88s)]
*  I've heard a lot of different words about this, but the ones that stand out to me are [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=582.88s)]
*  this is impossible, this will never happen, maybe he doesn't mean it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=588.88s)]
*  And I would like to try and put a pause on that thinking to an extent, because I think [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=592.88s)]
*  we've learned by now, and a lot of what we talked about here on Morning Joe during the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=598.88s)]
*  campaign is Donald Trump does mean it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=604.88s)]
*  He means it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=608.88s)]
*  This is a man who said during the campaign he wouldn't pardon January 6 rioters, and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=609.88s)]
*  he has done so. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=614.88s)]
*  This is a man who said that he would be your retribution and threatened retribution to [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=616.88s)]
*  people who worked on cases against him. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=621.88s)]
*  That is happening right now in the FBI. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=624.88s)]
*  Let's stop surmising as to whether or not he means it, because he means it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=627.88s)]
*  Okay? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=633.88s)]
*  So, Mark Polymeropoulos, my question to you is what will the promotion of this idea do [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=634.88s)]
*  to the delicate state of affairs in the region? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=640.88s)]
*  Right, Miki, and so I think every CIA station chief in the Middle East woke up this morning [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=644.88s)]
*  with a migraine headache, because there's a potential for a generational counterterrorism [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=650.88s)]
*  nightmare here. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=654.88s)]
*  You have to look at the words that Donald Trump used yesterday, quote, take over Gaza, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=655.88s)]
*  own Gaza. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=660.88s)]
*  These are triggering mechanisms for Islamic extremist groups. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=662.88s)]
*  Remember, Osama bin Laden's biggest beef with the United States decades ago was the U.S. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=665.88s)]
*  troop presence in Saudi Arabia. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=669.88s)]
*  Al-Qaeda in Iraq, same thing, the insurgency based on U.S. troops in Iraq. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=671.88s)]
*  So this kind of language only is going to galvanize groups that want to kill Americans. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=675.88s)]
*  And if I was in the CIA and is still in the CIA and the counterterrorism community, I'd [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=679.88s)]
*  be monitoring the Islamic extremist forums, because this is just a tremendous own goal. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=684.88s)]
*  And I worry that even if these are just words, as Richard said, perhaps part of some strange [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=689.88s)]
*  negotiating gambit, Americans might be less safe now. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=693.88s)]
*  And I can't imagine anybody in the CIA or the State Department who would have advocated [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=697.88s)]
*  this approach. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=702.88s)]
*  Talk about the ceasefire agreement in place. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=704.88s)]
*  I mean, there are hostages still due to come home. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=707.88s)]
*  We are watching these reunions. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=709.88s)]
*  They're incredibly emotional. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=711.88s)]
*  I know President Trump is very much into seeing these reunions and positive things like that [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=713.88s)]
*  happening, hoping to take credit for them and things like that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=720.88s)]
*  What could these comments and this intention do to the ceasefire agreement that's in place [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=724.88s)]
*  right now? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=731.88s)]
*  Well, sure, Mika, because there's a delicate balance that's going on right now, and we're [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=733.88s)]
*  trying to get through this phase one, perhaps to get to phase two. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=736.88s)]
*  But there are still hostages who need to be released. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=741.88s)]
*  And so if you're Hamas right now and you hear these comments, how do you, even if there was [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=744.88s)]
*  some distrust in the past, but how do you see the U.S. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=749.88s)]
*  as an interlocutor that you can agree with when they're saying all of the Palestinians [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=752.88s)]
*  have to be removed from the Gaza Strip with all of this kind of fanciful language? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=756.88s)]
*  So even this kind of strange rhetoric from Trump could really alter a very delicate negotiating [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=761.88s)]
*  pattern right now, which has seen hostages released. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=768.88s)]
*  More are supposed to come this weekend. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=771.88s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=773.88s)]
*  All right, NBC News security and intelligence analyst Mark Polymeropoulos, thank you very [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=775.88s)]
*  much for coming on the show this morning. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=781.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=798.88s)]
