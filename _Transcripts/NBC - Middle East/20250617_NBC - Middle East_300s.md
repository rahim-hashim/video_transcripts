# Trump: 'We now have complete and total control' of skies over Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc)
*  I want to bring in Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for the New York Times and an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=0.0s)]
*  So Peter, I want to ask you about something that Donald Trump just posted on Truth Social. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=6.0s)]
*  It says, we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=11.0s)]
*  Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American-made, conceived, and manufactured stuff. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=18.0s)]
*  Nobody does it better than the good old USA. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=28.0s)]
*  Can you give us some context on this and do we know what stuff is? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=32.0s)]
*  Well, the operative word in that post is the word we. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=37.0s)]
*  We now have control of the airspace over Iran. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=42.0s)]
*  That's very suggestive and very curious, right? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=46.0s)]
*  The question there is, what does he mean by we? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=49.0s)]
*  Is the United States actually participating at this point? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=51.0s)]
*  Because up until now, our understanding is this has been entirely conducted by Israel on the offensive side of things. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=53.0s)]
*  The United States has agreed to help defend Israel against retaliatory strikes from Iran. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=59.0s)]
*  But up until now, we don't know of any US participation in the offensive strikes that Israel has been waging for the last several days. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=65.0s)]
*  This seems to suggest perhaps some involvement. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=71.0s)]
*  Now, he also may just be referring to American hardware, which Israel, of course, is using as part of its military. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=74.0s)]
*  It's military is based in large part on American technology, American military equipment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=80.0s)]
*  So it possibly is just a reference to the fact that he's claiming credit in effect for American technology and know how being used by Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=86.0s)]
*  So that's an open question. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=94.0s)]
*  And it raises, of course, the larger question, which is, is the United States going to participate in a bigger way if it is already in these strikes, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=96.0s)]
*  particularly as you mentioned at the top of the show against the Forto nuclear facility, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=104.0s)]
*  which most analysts believe only American military can actually take out? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=109.0s)]
*  Well, as part of that big picture, as you know, Peter, the president has campaigned for a decade on not getting involved in these kinds of wars. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=114.0s)]
*  Do you have a sense or what are people telling you about their sense of what it would take for him to go back on that now and whether his base would support him? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah, there does seem to be a real schism right now among the MAGA base. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=131.0s)]
*  Right. You see Tucker Carlson and some of these others who have been very reluctant to get involved with Israel's war saying, you know, back off. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=135.0s)]
*  Don't do this. This is a mistake. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=144.0s)]
*  They're trying to the deep state warmongers are trying to draw you in. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=145.0s)]
*  At the same time, you had a very interesting post today from Vice President J.D. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=149.0s)]
*  Vance, who typically is on the side of the more isolationist wing of the MAGA movement. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=153.0s)]
*  And this long post instead seems to be possibly laying the groundwork for a potentially Trump decision to use military force himself against Iran, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=158.0s)]
*  because what it does is talks about Iran's enrichment of uranium beyond what it would need for civilian uses. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=168.0s)]
*  It seems to be making the case that Iran has violated its obligations and therefore potentially at least justifying action by the United States. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=175.0s)]
*  What are your sources telling you, Peter? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=185.0s)]
*  Or what do you imagine this meeting is that the president is expected to have with his advisors today? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=187.0s)]
*  And what actually is on the table? What's at the core of the debate we think they're having? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=194.0s)]
*  Well, I think the debate, as you said, is for it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=200.0s)]
*  I mean, because this is a bunker that is so deeply fortified, buried inside the mountains of Iran that Israeli forces, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=202.0s)]
*  as powerful as they are and as successful as they have been in the last few days, does not have the capacity to take out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=211.0s)]
*  If you want to genuinely cripple Iran's nuclear program, most people say you have to go after that facility in Florida, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=219.0s)]
*  otherwise you're just setting them back aways and not making any kind of lasting impact. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=225.0s)]
*  So that's the big question. Do you use the United States military force to participate in this operation? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=231.0s)]
*  And there's an argument to be made that now the operation has begun, even though Trump made clear he would have preferred diplomacy, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=237.0s)]
*  that if you're going to take out all the rest, you might as well take out Florida as well to do the maximum damage diplomatically. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=243.0s)]
*  You know, it may not be that much more cost at this point. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=249.0s)]
*  On the other hand, having the United States directly involved in the offensive operation is an escalation, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=253.0s)]
*  and it does put the United States in a war, in effect, with Iran. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=259.0s)]
*  And I think that's something that Trump has long avoided, long sought to avoid, and his base, a lot of his base, don't want any part of. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=262.0s)]
*  Peter Baker, thank you very much for that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=270.0s)]
*  And if you get any more intel on exactly what the president meant by that tweet, let us know. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=273.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTaXXXlnbAc&t=292.0s)]
