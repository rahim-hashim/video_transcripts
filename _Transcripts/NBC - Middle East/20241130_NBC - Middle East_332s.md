# ‘Heartbreaking, inhumane beyond words’: Fmr. Admiral reacts to latest video of Gaza hostage
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs)
*  Joining me now is former NATO Supreme Allied Commander and MSNBC Chief International Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=0.0s)]
*  Analyst, Admiral James De Vries. Admiral, it's always good to have you here, sir. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=4.64s)]
*  First of all, what do you make of the timing of this new video released by Hamas [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=8.64s)]
*  coming as the Biden administration hoped the Israel Hezbollah ceasefire [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=12.48s)]
*  will spark a similar deal with Hamas? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=16.8s)]
*  Well, first, it's simply heartbreaking, inhumane, cruel beyond words that Hamas, who [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=18.88s)]
*  captured by all accounts is tortured, continues to hold these hostages. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=27.92s)]
*  It tells you everything you need to know about this vicious terrorist organization. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=34.24s)]
*  I think point two is that the Israelis are going to continue to do all they can to rescue the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=39.36s)]
*  hostages, and the Netanyahu administration has indicated they're willing to pay $5 million [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=46.56s)]
*  for any of these hostages and I think also offer a free passage out of Gaza to those who have been [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=54.24s)]
*  holding them. I think that's designed to drive a wedge inside the remnants of Hamas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=62.0s)]
*  And then third and finally, Alex, clearly it's a message directed to Team Trump. I think it's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=67.68s)]
*  quite noticeable that they don't even mention the Biden administration. They talk about Trump, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=74.56s)]
*  and that's very typical globally at the moment. People are looking past [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=80.72s)]
*  the Biden administration and looking toward Trump. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=85.28s)]
*  Which is extraordinary given the fact that there are seven more weeks of this administration and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=88.08s)]
*  every single day, if not hour and minute counts when you think about that. But so this tenuous [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=92.0s)]
*  ceasefire, it appears to largely be holding despite several Israeli strikes. Do you expect [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=98.0s)]
*  it will hold for 60 days? And if you don't, does it just indicate the challenges to reaching a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  permanent ceasefire deal? How do you see them? What are the biggest challenges? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=108.72s)]
*  Well, first and foremost, I think the ceasefire will probably hold. And the reason is because the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=114.56s)]
*  incentives both for the Israelis and for Hezbollah run toward keeping the ceasefire in place. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=123.12s)]
*  From the Israeli side, Netanyahu is deeply committed to getting 60 to 70,000 Israelis [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=131.52s)]
*  back into their homes in northern Israel. It's very different than down in Gaza. The Israelis [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  are not trying to move Israelis into Gaza or run Gaza. Up north, what they want is to get their [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  own Israeli citizens back. So their motivations lean toward a ceasefire. And on the Hezbollah [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=151.84s)]
*  side, they're battered. They had a cadre of leaders taken out by the Israelis in a variety [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=158.4s)]
*  of different ways, including the exploding beeper caper, as well as at the moment Iran, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=164.56s)]
*  which is the funding source for Hezbollah, is on their back foot as well. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=172.4s)]
*  So I think both sides up north are looking for a ceasefire. The question, Alex, you've got it [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=177.36s)]
*  exactly right, is whether this could lead to a ceasefire in Gaza. There I'm less optimistic, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=182.64s)]
*  frankly. Well, frankly, as well, Hezbollah said it would not agree to a deal until a ceasefire [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  was reached in Gaza. But then Hamas's militia, it has been severely weakened. Its leader, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  Yaya Sinwar, is dead. President-elect Trump has said Israel should do whatever it needs to win the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=200.32s)]
*  war. Now with Hamas's most important ally potentially out of the fight, how does that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=205.92s)]
*  impact the war in Gaza? Could Hamas agree to a ceasefire if it thinks it's going to get more [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=212.56s)]
*  favorable terms under Biden than Trump? That would be a pretty good theory. But I don't [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=218.0s)]
*  see Hamas as being nimble enough at this moment to take advantage of this remaining seven week [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  interregnum. Let's recall Sinwar is dead, Sinwar is a senior. It appears his brother may be now [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=232.64s)]
*  running the organization, but it's a shadow of its former self as having grave difficulty getting [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=240.32s)]
*  organized and can't communicate. It's under constant attack. So I think the idea that they'll [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=247.27999999999997s)]
*  be clever enough to cut some kind of nuanced deal with the Biden administration, frankly, unlikely. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=253.27999999999997s)]
*  Where we all ought to be putting pressure at this moment is on the Arab states and any others who [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=259.76s)]
*  are providing support to Hamas. Obviously, Iran, a Persian state, but until very recently, for [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=267.2s)]
*  example, Qatar hosted Hamas officials. They've been kicked out. It appears, shockingly to me, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=276.8s)]
*  they may be reconstituting Al Aqsa in Turkey, which is a place where the U.S. could put real [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=283.44s)]
*  pressure on the government in order to put pressure on Hamas. So I think Hamas must feel the walls [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=289.76s)]
*  closing in and they would be smart to cut a deal as quickly as they can. I'm just not sure they're [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=297.28s)]
*  nimble enough or well led enough to do so. Okay, Admiral, I always appreciate your very [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=303.68s)]
*  keen insights and all your experience. Thanks for sharing it with us. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LS8FeaY3Rs&t=308.56s)]
