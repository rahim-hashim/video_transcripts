# Trump says U.S. should ‘level’ Gaza, create ‘Riviera of the Middle East’
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs)
*  Good evening from Seattle. I'm Chris Hayes. Last hour, Donald Trump wrapped up a lengthy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=0.0s)]
*  joint appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And over the course of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=4.96s)]
*  a rambling, often incoherent hour, the president of the United States appeared to announce [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=9.68s)]
*  a completely unprecedented American policy towards Gaza and the people that live there [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=16.64s)]
*  that on its face would both violate international law and be seen by millions, maybe hundreds [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=23.32s)]
*  of millions or billions around the world as the U.S. backing explicit ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=28.6s)]
*  The announcement has enormous implications for the region, for Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=35.24s)]
*  for U.S. service members who apparently are going to be pressed into service for this [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=41.06s)]
*  project. President Trump announcing the U.S. would, in his words, own, that's the word [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=44.96s)]
*  he used, own Gaza, that it would transfer the population of the 1.8 million Palestinians [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=51.04s)]
*  who live there amidst the rubble and the damage, those who have survived the last year and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=60.16s)]
*  a half, that they would be transferred out of Gaza into what he speculated could be as [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=64.76s)]
*  many as a dozen other countries that will apparently take them in. He said the U.S. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=69.78s)]
*  would possibly send American troops to Gaza and develop the region into, quote, the Riviera [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=75.0s)]
*  of the Middle East. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=82.44s)]
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, too. We'll own [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=85.36s)]
*  it, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=90.92s)]
*  and housing for the people of the area, do a real job, do something different, just can't [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  go back. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=103.72s)]
*  Are you talking tonight about the United States taking over a sovereign territory? What authority [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=105.44s)]
*  would allow you to do that? Are you talking about a permanent occupation there? Redevelopment? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=110.32s)]
*  I do see a long-term ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=116.0s)]
*  part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East. And everybody I've spoken to, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=122.88s)]
*  this was not a decision made lightly, everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=132.78s)]
*  that will be magnificent in a really magnificent area. We have an opportunity to do something [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=138.34s)]
*  that could be phenomenal. And I don't want to be cute, I don't want to be a wise guy, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  but the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be something that could be so magnificent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=150.08s)]
*  Now, it's a little unclear whether this was an announcement of a new policy, although [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=157.08s)]
*  it seemed to be something he deliberated on, the Commander in Chief, or it was just [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=162.22s)]
*  Donald Trump riffing off the cuff. But again, he said all this on stage with Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=166.7s)]
*  after the two men had met in the Oval Office, so it seemed to be a formal policy announcement. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=171.46s)]
*  The President of the United States saying that we need to try something new in the Middle [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=176.82s)]
*  East and apparently something new means the American occupation and forced depopulation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=181.46s)]
*  and expulsion of sovereign territory currently inhabited by 1.8 million people. Senator Chris [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=189.74s)]
*  Van Hollen is a Democrat of Maryland. He sits on the Foreign Relations Committee. He's been [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=199.02s)]
*  very outspoken about U.S. policy in the Middle East. He joins me now. Senator, I guess I [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=202.58s)]
*  just first, this appears to be an actual announcement of current U.S. policy that we will own Gaza, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=208.3s)]
*  that we will go in and that U.S. troops might be sent. Your reaction? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=215.7s)]
*  So, Chris, I think we need to reiterate what the President of the United States just said, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=220.78s)]
*  and you said it, but it bears repeating. He just said that it will be United States [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=226.98s)]
*  policy to forcibly displace 2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. That is ethnic [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=231.66s)]
*  He said the United States would then own the Gaza Strip and that we would develop the Gaza Strip [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=241.1s)]
*  and that other countries would take these Palestinians. He says he's talked to a lot [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=248.94s)]
*  of people and they think it's a great idea. Well, we know that just a few weeks ago, the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  Arab countries, the Arab countries had an emergency meeting and responded forcefully [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=261.9s)]
*  against this idea and said it was unacceptable. So what the President is doing here is really [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=267.18s)]
*  throwing a match on an already very volatile region. This is something that Iran and our [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=272.62s)]
*  adversaries will celebrate. The super far right wing in Israel will celebrate. In fact, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  Ben Gavir, one of the farthest right members, has already tweeted out his support for the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=286.62s)]
*  President's idea. So this is a very volatile mix in addition to being despicable in so many ways. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=292.78s)]
*  Yeah, there's a few dimensions here, it's worth, and if I sound a little stunned, it's because I [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=303.5s)]
*  really am. You know, the forcible expulsion of 2 million people is an atrocity. That's the kind [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=308.46s)]
*  of thing that if any other nation state does it, we view it as an atrocity. You can't forcibly [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=315.58s)]
*  expel people. I'm not even clear, I mean, it's obviously violation of international law. I'm not even [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=323.5s)]
*  clear that he has American legal authority to do something like this. Well, certainly he doesn't [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  have the legal authority to deploy American forces, right, to push 2 million people out of Gaza. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=337.34s)]
*  That would require congressional authorization. He also, of course, ran on being the President [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=347.74s)]
*  who is going to stop all wars, not get us in the middle of more conflicts. So this is why [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  it is such a jaw-dropping moment for the American people and the country, for the President of the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=362.94s)]
*  United States to say, as you say, I mean, this isn't just like a paper violation of international [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=369.34s)]
*  law. It is ethnic cleansing by another name, and it will certainly embolden our adversaries, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=374.3s)]
*  and it is really going to worry, is a soft word. It's going to scare our friends, and this is a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=382.62s)]
*  moment, Chris, for the Arab countries to tell President Trump that they meant what they said, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=388.78s)]
*  that they opposed this idea, and that they believe that the only way to secure long-term peace and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=395.9s)]
*  stability and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians alike is through self-determination for both [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=402.7s)]
*  peoples and a two-state solution. That's what they've been saying. This is really going to be a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=408.7s)]
*  moment to look carefully at how they respond. There's a moral dimension, there's a strategic [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=413.58s)]
*  and legal dimension, but there's also a security dimension here, and you alluded to it, but I think [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=421.97999999999996s)]
*  it's worth spending some time. The U.S. has tens of thousands of service members deployed in the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=425.18s)]
*  Middle East. The President of the United States has just announced to the world that they are [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=429.97999999999996s)]
*  soon to be used for a project of ethnic cleansing in the most volatile, sensitive region in the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  world, and I can't help but feel like has essentially painted a target on the back of every [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=440.86s)]
*  service member in the region. Well, that's exactly what he's done, because this is the most sort of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=447.66s)]
*  volatile, toxic mix of ideas that you could bring together at this particular moment, and so it will [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=457.5s)]
*  be a moment of great danger for Americans, whether there are service men in the region, there are [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=466.7s)]
*  embassy personnel in the region. No, it is such an irresponsible and reckless act by the President [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=473.5s)]
*  of the United States, and like you, I found myself just stunned. I mean, he'd been making comments [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=482.06s)]
*  leading up to this moment, but to really announce it as U.S. policy, he also said, and we should be [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=491.9s)]
*  very alert for what's happening next, he said within the next two weeks, he's going to make some [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=498.7s)]
*  decisions regarding the West Bank, and who knows what he's thinking about there? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=504.46s)]
*  You're a U.S. Senator, and obviously you're in the minority. That means that you can't control [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=514.38s)]
*  what happens in the U.S. Senate, but there is a lot of things that U.S. senators can do. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=519.02s)]
*  Because of unanimous consent and because of the way the Senate functions, there's a kind of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=524.54s)]
*  tacit set of norms that you all have to come to agreement on in order to have the place run, and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=530.22s)]
*  as a Senator, I know you and your colleagues like to see it doing work. At what point does it become [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=535.1s)]
*  important to use every procedural means to essentially bring the body to a halt until [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=542.94s)]
*  this policy and what's happening with Elon Musk and USAID and what seems to be a raft of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=550.38s)]
*  flagrantly illegal actions are stopped or curtailed? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=556.46s)]
*  Well, I think that moment is now. I think that moment is now, and look, a group of us were outside [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=561.66s)]
*  the Department of Treasury today essentially saying we cannot have business as usual. We're [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=567.82s)]
*  not going to let Elon Musk take over the government of the United States and take these illegal actions [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=573.74s)]
*  to stop federal funds from going to our communities, from trying to replace merit-based [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=580.22s)]
*  civil servants with political cronies, take over the payment system, and get access to people's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=585.6600000000001s)]
*  Social Security numbers. So that is now, which is why Senator Schatz and I and others have said [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=591.34s)]
*  in response to the AID action that we're going to shut down any nominations with respect to Trump [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=600.14s)]
*  appointees in the foreign policy sphere, but I think we need to go more broadly. I've been a very [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=607.58s)]
*  clear advocate for no business as usual given all of what's happening around our country. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=612.46s)]
*  I mean, the President of the United States just announced the U.S. is going to back [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=619.34s)]
*  ethnic cleansing of two million people. I just, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=624.14s)]
*  thank you for making time tonight. I really do appreciate it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=629.9s)]
*  Chris, thank you. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oscnNPIDsGs&t=633.1s)]
