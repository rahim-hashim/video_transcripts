*  in addition the European Union's chief diplomat echoed that message urging all sides to step back and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  Return to the negotiating table while emphasizing that Iran must not be permitted to develop a nuclear weapon [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=44.86s)]
*  Let me bring in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=51.78s)]
*  Hologram a NBC News foreign correspondent who is in London for us today and talk about what is going to be happening tomorrow [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=53.5s)]
*  Because Iran's foreign minister says he's going to be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin talk about the significance of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=60.3s)]

*  President those two countries have enjoyed a very close strategic [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=81.26s)]
*  partnership now for several decades Iran has been the ally of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=85.9s)]
*  Russia in its [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=91.30000000000001s)]

*  It's an open question what the Iranian foreign minister will get out of it because Russia also enjoys a pretty close [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=105.78s)]
*  Relationship with Israel itself [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=113.62s)]

*  So this is kind of a way to present this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=143.42s)]
*  unified front with a very [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=147.1s)]
*  powerful [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=150.1s)]

*  It seems as though the primary concern for Iran Chris is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=175.18s)]
*  regime [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6T9x1BJ1o&t=179.54s)]
