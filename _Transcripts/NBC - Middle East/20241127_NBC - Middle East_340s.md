# Father of U.S.-Israeli hostage: Lebanon ceasefire is ‘missed opportunity’ for Gaza hostage deal
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0)
*  Joining me now is Ruby Han, father of Itai Han, U.S. citizen held hostage in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=0.0s)]
*  Ruby, what is your reaction to the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah for Lebanon? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  RUBY HAN, U.S. President and U.S. Secretary of State for Israel and Hezbollah for Lebanon [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=12.08s)]
*  Thank you, André, for having me. 418 days since I last talked to my son. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=13.36s)]
*  We, the U.S. family, seven U.S. citizens that have been held hostage for such a long time, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  we welcome the ceasefire agreements in the north of the border of Israel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=28.24s)]
*  But we also have a feeling of disappointment, as it was a missed opportunity to connect [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=34.32s)]
*  this agreement with, say, the release of the hostages. Why do I say a missed opportunity? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=41.44s)]
*  Because when you look at the principles of the ceasefire agreements with Hezbollah, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=47.68s)]
*  those are the same principles that Hamas is asking. And we fail to understand why [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=54.56s)]
*  the Israeli government does not understand the magnitude and time sensitivity of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  fact that they have 101 hostages being held in dungeons underneath Gaza and not finding a way [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=66.88s)]
*  to get them out. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  President Biden has tweeted today that, over the coming days, the United States will make another [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=78.08s)]
*  push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=85.92s)]
*  released and an end to the war, at least my voice here, without Hamas in power. Does that give you hope? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=91.84s)]
*  Yes, we, the U.S. citizens, met President Biden in the Oval Office about two weeks ago. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=102.72s)]
*  It was a meeting that a few hours before he met President-elect Trump. It was important for him [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=111.28s)]
*  to share with us that he suggested to the President-elect to meet the U.S. families, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=116.96s)]
*  the hostage families, as well as urging the new team to collaborate with the existing team [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=123.44s)]
*  to put this topic, which is a bipartisan topic, in motion today and not wait [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=130.56s)]
*  until the inauguration of January 20th. We, the hostages, don't have that time to wait. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=139.44s)]
*  And we also feel that there is a geopolitical ecosystem in the Middle East that everyone wishes [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=145.68s)]
*  to appease the incoming president, as such there is an opportunity to broker a deal with the existing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=153.68s)]
*  administration and the new administration together, putting pressure on all the parties to get a deal [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  that will unite not only my family but 100 other families. And we, again, on the eve of Thanksgiving, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  will need to see an empty chair at our dinner table with a missing family member. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=177.44s)]
*  And Ruby, you know, we've known each other a while now, more than a year, and, you know, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  you're in our hearts. We all talk about you and your families. But when we think about this, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=190.96s)]
*  is it possible that the Trump people will work together with the Biden people? They seem to be [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=199.12s)]
*  supportive of this Lebanon deal. They weren't really involved. But will it now take active [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=205.52s)]
*  involvement by both sides to try to make this happen? So in my understanding, Mr. Jake Sullivan, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=210.56s)]
*  indeed, had a meeting with Mr. Mike Walsh. I understand it was more of a courtesy meeting. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=218.4s)]
*  I hope to believe that a new meeting will be scheduled and we'll talk about the topic. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=224.32s)]
*  We, the U.S. families, as you know, have kept this a bipartisan issue. Over the last year, we have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=229.28s)]
*  have created open channels and good communication channels and meetings with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=236.16s)]
*  leaders of the Republican Party and the Senate and the House. And we hope that we believe that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=241.44s)]
*  they're also assisting in supporting the view that we don't have time. And this is something [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=247.44s)]
*  that can be worked together between the two teams for the benefit of these U.S. citizens that it's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=254.56s)]
*  been way too long since we've had a good opportunity to get them out. Now's a good time. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=260.8s)]
*  Indeed. Well, let's hope we have more to be thankful for as soon as tomorrow, if not every day. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=268.8s)]
*  Yeah, and then the dust just was coming up badly. We're waiting for that miracle to happen, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=274.88s)]
*  that we would all be united. And we wouldn't be glad to see that picture of January 20th [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  the inauguration as we remember in the past with President Reagan, that on that day, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=285.68s)]
*  all the hostages came out. Oh, I was there. We would be able to come with our family members [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=291.2s)]
*  to that inauguration as a family that is whole again and be able to thank both presidents for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=296.96s)]
*  what they did to us. Indeed. That was a memorable day for all of us who had been covering the Iranian [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=302.96s)]
*  and the American. Let's see it again. That is the prayer. That is the hope. Thank you so much, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Rubi Kahn. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VHADcKr_f0&t=318.64s)]
