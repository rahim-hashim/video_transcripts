# Engel Details Corridor Outside Kabul Airport, Site Of Possible Infiltration
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk)
*  Richard, Richard Engel, let's talk about that, because what we were told by Secretary Blinken [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday, as you know, they've been gearing up these efforts to try to get all of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=4.8s)]
*  Americans out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=11.64s)]
*  They reported to us from the secretary that there were 1,500 Americans still to depart, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=12.64s)]
*  500 had been contacted, 1,000 they were trying to contact, to get those remaining 1,000 out [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=17.72s)]
*  before the deadline, which is August 31st, but actually before that by several days, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  presumably because they have to begin scaling back. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=29.2s)]
*  What would this interruption mean? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=33.28s)]
*  An interruption in flights taking off, people being able to get to the airport, certainly. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=35.84s)]
*  So yes, more of an interruption of people to get to the airport. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=44.24s)]
*  The airfield is massive. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=48.16s)]
*  The airfield, this blast, because of the number of barriers in place, would not have impacted [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=50.04s)]
*  the airfield, would not have impacted the flight line, would not have impacted aircraft [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=57.92s)]
*  in that area. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  But it would certainly impact access to that gate. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=64.12s)]
*  There are only so many functional gates onto the airbase. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=67.4s)]
*  The US is now trying to get as many people onto the base who are qualified to leave Afghanistan, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=70.56s)]
*  primarily US citizens and other Afghans who have the right paperwork. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=77.4s)]
*  So if one gate is no longer operational or is taken out of operation for a time being, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=83.6s)]
*  that means there are only about two others that are still working. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  So it certainly limits the ability to get people onto that base, but it would not impact [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=94.96s)]
*  the ability to carry out the airlift. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  While you were talking to Courtney, we were able to find a video. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=102.08s)]
*  I actually drove through with our colleagues here, with our reporting team, that exact [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  corridor a few days ago. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=111.08s)]
*  I think you have that video, and I can help put some of the geography together. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=112.96s)]
*  So if you start at the Baron Hotel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  The Baron Hotel... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=119.52s)]
*  So if you... [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=122.44s)]
*  That video, and I can't see it right now, but I can describe it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=123.44s)]
*  When you leave the Baron Hotel, you drive through this corridor, a narrow corridor flanked [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=127.08s)]
*  on either side by concrete blast barriers. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=132.48s)]
*  And in that, if you slow down the video, you can see there is a drainage ditch. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=136.6s)]
*  I believe it's on the right-hand side in the video over my shoulder. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=140.88s)]
*  That drainage sewage ditch, that would be a possible infiltration route where a suicide [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=145.76s)]
*  bomber could come in through the actual... wade through the sewage and debris in that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=150.6s)]
*  ditch. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=156.24s)]
*  And that is where we have seen videos showing a number of bodies floating in that filthy [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=157.56s)]
*  water. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=163.32s)]
*  So when you come out of the Baron, you leave, you go a couple of hundred yards down this [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=164.32s)]
*  fortified corridor. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Afghans were gathering there, hoping that they could get into the Abbey Gate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=171.84s)]
*  When we went there, it was a coordinated effort. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=175.32s)]
*  We drove, we arrived at the Abbey Gate, and they were expecting us, and U.S. personnel [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=177.88s)]
*  and other foreign nationals, other foreign military personnel allowed us through. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=185.48s)]
*  But that means that there is a military presence at that gate to allow people in. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  So if the explosions, as we're hearing now, took place in that corridor, the U.S. personnel [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=195.56s)]
*  wouldn't be directly impacted. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=201.68s)]
*  They would have been on the other side of the gate, but these apparently were quite [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=203.36s)]
*  large explosions causing massive casualties, and as Courtney is reporting, apparently wounding [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=207.56s)]
*  at least three Marines. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=214.12s)]
*  So these bases have a lot of corridors, and it seems that ISIS was able to, presumably [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  was able to infiltrate this one corridor, carry out this attack, and that would limit [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=223.12s)]
*  access to the base, and it would put ISIS back on the map. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=229.04s)]
*  If you remember, ISIS was defeated. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=232.4s)]
*  ISIS was yesterday's story. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=234.84s)]
*  ISIS is not from Afghanistan. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=236.52s)]
*  ISIS is from Iraq and Syria. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=238.28s)]
*  They were pushed out of their caliphate, but there were many ISIS prisoners inside the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=239.96s)]
*  jails in Afghanistan, and as Kabul fell, the Taliban were breaking into those prisoners [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=246.48s)]
*  to release their own militants, and some ISIS prisoners escaped as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=251.6s)]
*  The Taliban has been looking for them, and I know this from speaking to the Taliban, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  also from witness accounts. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=261.56s)]
*  The Taliban have been setting up checkpoints. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=262.84s)]
*  They've been trying to hunt down some of these ISIS militants, but there is a lot of confusion [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=265.36s)]
*  in Kabul. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=270.76s)]
*  If you want to hide, you can hide, and it seems like at least one, perhaps two, were [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=271.76s)]
*  able to penetrate, perhaps through this sewage canal, that corridor between the Baron Hotel [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=277.16s)]
*  and the Abbey Gate, carry out an explosion, put themselves back into the public discussion, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=283.76s)]
*  ride on the coattails of the Taliban's victory, and carry out this attack. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCCnkr2rPk&t=291.32s)]
