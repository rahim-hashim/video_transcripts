# 'It Was A Mistake': Rep. Colin Allred On U.S House Members Kabul Trip
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI)
*  All of it. I want to bring in Congressman Acon already Democrat Texas, a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Congressman, thanks for your time on this Wednesday morning. As you know, there continue to be some doubts about whether the United States is actually going to be able to evacuate all of our allies by that August 31st deadline. The president's decided to stick to what happens if we don't, Congressman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=0.0s)]
*  And I'm also on the Foreign Affairs Committee and just got out of another classified briefing here. We have to first understand this is an incredibly dangerous situation and mission for our Marines, our troops and our State Department personnel every single day. And every single day it's going to get more dangerous. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=22.8s)]
*  And the president has said, and I agree that any deadline is contingent upon a number of things, including how the Taliban continues to help us in terms of getting people to the airport safely. But our mission is not going to end on August 31st in terms of trying to help people in Afghanistan who want to leave. We already have some negotiations in place. They're going to be ongoing to see what we can do to continue to try to help people get out after that date. We want to work with our allies, others who have relations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=40.6s)]
*  With the Taliban and it's going to be contingent upon the Taliban, which is it is for any government around the world to if they have citizens or if they have people in their country who want to leave and that they are allowed to do that. And we're going to hold them to that as an international community. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=70.6s)]
*  And there are a lot of levers that we do still have in place, including some pretty enormous financial levers over them to try and make sure that we continue to do that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  I want to go back to that Foreign Affairs Committee briefing that you just mentioned for a moment there. Can you characterize the nature of it? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, I'll say that I'm incredibly proud of the mission, the way it's being carried out by our Marines, our troops and our State Department personnel on the ground. What they're doing is remarkable. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=104.4s)]
*  And every American should know that. Every American should know and be proud of the work that they've done to create a more orderly process at that airport. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=116.4s)]
*  Nearly 90,000 folks have been evacuated by us. That's not even counting our partner countries who we have allowed because of our security perimeter that we've created to evacuate thousands more. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=126.4s)]
*  And so the mission that they're carrying out there is going well in terms of what they're doing. But it's also incredibly dangerous. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=137.4s)]
*  And I am extremely concerned about every single day as we go into this. And so I ask every American to keep all of our Americans who are in harm's way right now in your prayers. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=145.4s)]
*  They're doing the very best they can. We should be proud of them as Americans. But we also have to recognize that they are in incredible danger right now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=155.4s)]
*  Acknowledging that pride for a moment here, Congressman, what do you say to those who contend that we are undoubtedly going to be leaving behind some of our allies, some of the very people who sacrificed, risked their lives and sacrificed a great deal over the past 20 years? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=161.4s)]
*  We are going to abandon those people. What do you say to those critics? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=185.4s)]
*  Well, I say this has been a tragedy in terms of the speed with which the Afghan government fell. It did occur faster than any assessment could have foreseen. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=191.4s)]
*  And so what we're seeing is that we've had to do so much in a very short space of time. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=203.4s)]
*  But as I said, our mission is not going to end on August 31st to try and help the Afghans who helped us. We're going to stay on this. I'm going to stay on this. I'm going to stay on our State Department, stay on our partners around the world to try to use every lever that we have to try and protect as much as we possibly can. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=209.4s)]
*  Those who, as you said, risked their lives to help us. This 20 year occupation that we had has left us, of course, now in this situation where with the complete collapse of the Afghan government in a short space of time, there are folks who are not going to be able to get to the airport by August 31st. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=230.4s)]
*  But we as Americans can't lose faith with them. We have to keep the pressure up. We have over 70% of their foreign federal reserve is in our control. If they want access to those funds, they have to continue to work with us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=251.4s)]
*  If they want to not become a pariah, as they have been in the past, that have no access to international funding of any kind, no access to international humanitarian aid of any kind, they're going to have to continue to work with us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=265.4s)]
*  So we have levers in place. We have to keep that faith. And I want to stress that. I know there's a lot of talk about the deadline. And of course, after the deadline, it will be more difficult. But that doesn't mean the mission ends. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=276.4s)]
*  You've alluded to a couple of times during our conversation outside groups, perhaps helping after the deadline passes. We've heard about some veterans groups organizing to rescue our allies in Afghanistan. How is the Veterans Affairs Committee helping them? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=287.4s)]
*  You know, our veterans have been impacted by this in so many ways emotionally. This has been an incredibly difficult period for every veteran who served in Afghanistan to see what's been happening. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=305.4s)]
*  But they've also mobilized. And I want to thank my constituent veterans who've reached out to me. We have had some success in getting the folks they worked with out of Afghanistan. There are others that we're still working on right now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=317.4s)]
*  But they have done an incredible job in helping us also understand where some of these folks are. It's very complex. I'm sure you can imagine. Not just to identify who we want to get out, but where they are and how we can try to get them to safety. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=331.4s)]
*  And so every piece of intelligence that we can get on that is incredibly important. Our veterans have helped provide that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=347.4s)]
*  As I said, we're going to have to keep pushing on this mission. I refuse to accept that we are going to give up on anyone who served with us, who wants to get out. We may not be completely successful in every single case, but I think it's a commitment of the American people that our country has to make to do whatever we can. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=353.4s)]
*  As you know, your colleagues in the House, Congressman Seth Moulton, Congressman Peter Meyer, they took this secret, unauthorized trip to Kabul on Tuesday. Congressman Moulton described seasoned State Department officials and Marines who cried describing their work there. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=372.4s)]
*  He talked about the fear and the desperation that he saw. What's your response to that trip happening and also to what your colleagues saw? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=388.4s)]
*  You know, I respect both Seth and Congressman Meyer. I respect them for their service to our country. I respect them as members of Congress and my colleagues, but I think that trip was a mistake. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=398.4s)]
*  It was clearly a mistake. It was a misuse of resources at a time when they were critically needed for much more important tasks. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=408.4s)]
*  Oversight, as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, is going to be something we're going to be doing for quite some time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=416.4s)]
*  But now is not the time to do it in the midst of this when you're going to be diverting resources. And that, to me, is a mistake. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=421.4s)]
*  Now, in terms of what they saw, obviously, this is incredibly difficult, traumatic, and there are enormous emotions involved with this. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=428.4s)]
*  Everyone should understand that our State Department personnel who are there, many of them have served for decades in Afghanistan, have complex and deep relationships with the Afghan people. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=435.4s)]
*  This is incredibly difficult for them. Yes, it is emotional. And yes, it's dangerous. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=446.4s)]
*  And that's why we should be so thankful and proud of the mission that these Americans are carrying out over there. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=451.4s)]
*  But it's not the time for members of Congress to try and go over and perform their own personal oversight. That clearly was a mistake. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=457.4s)]
*  Before I let you go, I do want to ask you about the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would restore parts of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=462.4s)]
*  Last time Congress voted to authorize it, reauthorize it, I should say. Voting Rights Act, it passed the Senate 98 to 0. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=471.4s)]
*  That was in 2006. This is a different Senate, different political landscape in myriad ways. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=478.4s)]
*  But as a Congressman from Texas, which is going through a huge debate on voting laws and potential plans that would make it harder to vote, how would you convince a Republican in the upper chamber to vote yes? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=483.4s)]
*  It's also true that my constituent, George W. Bush, who was Republican president, signed that extension of the Voting Rights Act. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=496.4s)]
*  I think it got 390 votes in the House. This used to not be a controversial idea that we would protect voting rights. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=503.4s)]
*  And one of the things that I've been most frustrated with, and as you may know, I was a voting rights lawyer before I came to Congress, is this idea that protecting voting rights helps one party or another. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=511.4s)]
*  When I registered voters or tried to help them vote, I never asked them who they were going to vote for. That's not the point of it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=521.4s)]
*  I mean, the point of it is that in a democracy, you should be able to vote for whoever you want to. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=527.4s)]
*  And we also recognize that it's not the first time in our history we've had states that tried to make it harder for certain Americans to engage in their democracy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=531.4s)]
*  And we had to have federal oversight to try and make sure that from state to state, our democracy didn't look radically different. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=540.4s)]
*  This is not the first time we've done this. And of course, the Republican Senate and senators helped President Johnson push this through in the first place. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=546.4s)]
*  So I would say look to our history, to my colleagues in the upper chamber. Look to our history. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=554.4s)]
*  Look to the names that were involved, both in the creation of the Voting Rights Act, those who have recertified it several times. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=559.4s)]
*  And imagine what it means to our democracy if, as we had last night, every single Republican in the Congress says we don't want to stand up for the voting rights of Americans. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=567.4s)]
*  This is not about helping Democrats. It's about protecting our democracy. And we have to get away from that idea that this is somehow a partisan push. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=579.4s)]
*  Protecting people's voting rights is not about who they're going to vote for. It's about protecting our democracy. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=587.4s)]
*  Congressman Colin Allred, we're going to have to leave it there. I hope you'll come back at some point. Thank you for your time, Congressman. Do appreciate you. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=592.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtHm-uVAnVI&t=598.4s)]
