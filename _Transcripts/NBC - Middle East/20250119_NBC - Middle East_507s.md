# Rep. Gottheimer on ceasefire: ‘We should worry less’ about who gets ‘credit’
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE)
*  Congressman, I see a slight smile on your face, because certainly it is a day of relief [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=0.0s)]
*  for these three women hostages released and the start of the ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=5.04s)]
*  But, however, you still have one of your constituents being held by Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=9.32s)]
*  Adan Alexander will not be part of this entire first phase of hostages that are being released [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=14.48s)]
*  over the next six weeks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=20.68s)]
*  Do you, sir, have any sense of when he could be coming home and what his current condition [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=22.66s)]
*  or whereabouts are? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=27.6s)]
*  Well, as you pointed out, Alex, a significant and emotional day and seeing Romy and Emily [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=29.32s)]
*  and Darren, you know, out and with their home on their way to their families is very heart [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  wrenching and something that I hope and pray that we will have Adan and the Americans coming [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=42.92s)]
*  home soon as part of the 94 remaining hostages that we need to get freed, especially those [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=49.6s)]
*  Americans. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=54.68000000000001s)]
*  I want to point out that Adan Alexander, who's now 21, has not seen his family, as you know, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=55.76s)]
*  in 470 days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=61.48s)]
*  And, you know, I talk to the family all the time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=62.48s)]
*  They're just remarkable people, incredibly strong and optimistic. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=65.4s)]
*  But, you know, we know that this first phase, this 42 days, that right now he's not set [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=68.76s)]
*  to be part of that first release, which is why we must keep moving forward here, not [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=75.8s)]
*  take our eye off the ball. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=80.48s)]
*  We know that Hamas has been shameless in their statements, even as we have this pause going [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=81.76s)]
*  on, you know, immediately saying that they will commit another October 7th, that they [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=89.2s)]
*  continue to celebrate October 7th as a positive day in their history. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=94.36s)]
*  So you know, you're dealing with terrorists here every day, precious, as we move forward. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=100.0s)]
*  Congressman, I appreciate that you describe Adan's parents as being strong and trying [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=104.68s)]
*  to be optimistic, but there has to be a sense of heartbreak that he's not one of the first [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  to be released. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  I will say we do know two to be released. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  Keith Siegel will be released here on this 14th day of the ceasefire, followed by, let's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=118.68s)]
*  see, there will be Saghu Dekel Chen, who will come at some point soon after it's described. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=124.72s)]
*  We know that Siegel is injured as well. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=130.88s)]
*  But what are they saying to you in private about any disappointment that their son isn't [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=134.44s)]
*  coming home yet? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, obviously that's in private, so I won't share the private conversations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  But I'll just say, they are just incredible people who are focused as they have been and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=144.44s)]
*  kept hope every single day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=151.52s)]
*  And as you know, there was a proof of life video some weeks back, we saw Adan, and, you [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=153.24s)]
*  know, and they hadn't seen him in months and months, anything from him or heard from him, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=158.8s)]
*  because, as you know, Hamas is not allowed at any stage here, the terrorists of any [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=163.52s)]
*  visits from the Red Cross or any information. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  So they've just been positive and hopeful. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  And the bottom line is we have to, the focus, what they've said to me is, let's stay focused. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  Let's get, let's make sure that we get through this, that we obviously are able to, as you [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=180.8s)]
*  see happening today with the pause in Gaza, with continuing to focus on making sure we're [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=185.88s)]
*  not only protect Israel and our allies, but that we do everything to get the hostages [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=191.92s)]
*  home and get humanitarian aid in, which you see surging already, which is critical. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=197.0s)]
*  And as part of this process, of course, day 16, I believe they start negotiating that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=201.44s)]
*  next phase. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=205.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=206.88s)]
*  We get to day 16 here, which is critically important, get as many hostages out in the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=207.88s)]
*  meantime and focus on getting Adan and the others home, including, as you pointed out, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=211.56s)]
*  the seven Americans, including the three that we know we believe are alive, yes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=216.28s)]
*  That is hopeful for phase two, but you have to get through phase one first. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=220.86s)]
*  And there could be bumps. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=224.06s)]
*  Is there anything particular that worries you about the next now 41 days? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=226.86s)]
*  Or do you, are you confident the ceasefire conditions will hold? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=231.5s)]
*  Listen, you're deal, we've seen this in the past. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=235.34s)]
*  You're dealing with terrorist organizations, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  So you're dealing with, with Iran, who is an enemy of our country, as well as Hamas [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  and Hezbollah and Palestine Islamic Jihad. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=246.3s)]
*  We saw Palestine Islamic Jihad already speak out today and say they were going to, that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=248.34s)]
*  they were going to get in the way and block progress here on this pause and on this first [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=253.74s)]
*  phase. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=260.26s)]
*  So what am I concerned about? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=261.26s)]
*  I'm concerned about anything that can occur when you're dealing with terrorist organizations, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=262.42s)]
*  as we always have. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=266.98s)]
*  But listen, we understand the objectives. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=267.98s)]
*  There's been a lot of work that's gone into this, and it's a positive day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=270.58s)]
*  And let's keep focused on the ultimate goal here, which is getting all these hostages [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=276.26s)]
*  home, especially the Americans. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=280.74s)]
*  And I can't stress this enough Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, the Houthis, which continue to fire [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=282.02s)]
*  missiles, as of I believe yesterday, are their number one enemy is the United States of America, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=288.74s)]
*  our freedom and our democracy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=295.78s)]
*  Their death to the USA is on the Houthis flag. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  Hezbollah has been clear that that's their ultimate objective, is eliminating the us [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=301.5s)]
*  before, that is the goal. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=306.7s)]
*  Israel is a secondary goal to the United States as the number one enemy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=309.82s)]
*  So let's focus here on making sure that we free the Americans, all the hostages, stand [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  by our key ally, and of course make progress in the region. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=319.5s)]
*  Give me a sense of, first of all, I'm sure in your wildest dreams on October 7th of 2023, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=322.94s)]
*  you couldn't have possibly imagined it would extend this long, this terrible, terrible [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=329.82s)]
*  situation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  That said, how do you view the way the Biden administration has handled this? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  And let's also couple together with the last couple of weeks having Donald Trump's Middle [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=339.54s)]
*  East envoy going there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=343.94s)]
*  To what extent do you applaud what appears to be these two different factions from opposite [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=345.3s)]
*  sides of the aisle working together to bring about the result that we've seen? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=352.38s)]
*  I mean, this is about putting the country first, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=356.62s)]
*  So I believe if we get this done, everyone should get credit. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=359.54s)]
*  I give—some of the Biden administration has helped set up the structure over months [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=362.58000000000004s)]
*  and months of what we're dealing with today, you know, and getting the hostages home. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=366.18s)]
*  So—and—but they've worked very closely with the incoming administration, and I think [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=371.58000000000004s)]
*  that's a good thing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=376.3s)]
*  Everyone can get credit if this goes well, and the country can celebrate it, you know, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=377.3s)]
*  but that's how I look at it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=381.3s)]
*  But, you know, we have to keep our eyes focused on the ultimate goal here, which is worrying [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=383.26s)]
*  less about credit and worrying more about making sure we get a dime, the other Americans [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=388.1s)]
*  and of course all 94 hostages home. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=392.94s)]
*  That's got to be our goal, and let's worry less about, you know, who gets credit. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=395.1s)]
*  Everybody can celebrate when we get this done. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=398.62s)]
*  One last question, sir, that being relative to Iran since you brought it up. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=401.62s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham said that he would advise the incoming president and his administration [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=405.18s)]
*  to target Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=411.18s)]
*  What is your thought on that, the prospect of it? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=415.2s)]
*  I've always been very concerned about Iran's nuclear ability to go to develop nuclear weapons [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  and that has remained a concern, and I think we have to keep the pressure on and make sure [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=425.38s)]
*  that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=431.3s)]
*  That's been this administration's position, and we've got to stick with that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=433.26s)]
*  Listen, I think the last couple months, Iran has been greatly weakened. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=437.5s)]
*  Their program has been weakened, as you know, as—through certain—through attacks and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=442.70000000000005s)]
*  after Iran had attacked Israel and Israel responding, and I think, you know, we've—I [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=447.02s)]
*  think that's critically important that we keep Iran in check. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=451.34s)]
*  They are the parent company of terror in the region, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  They supply the weapons of Hamas and Hezbollah, the Taliban, Islamic Jihad, the Houthis, who [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  continue to attack American ships in our interests and our bases. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=463.46s)]
*  So you know, we shouldn't lose sight of who Iran, the government of Iran is and what [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=466.78s)]
*  they've been targeting, and they're no friend of ours, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=470.9s)]
*  They're part of the new—our new enemy set, right, with Russia, China, North Korea [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=473.54s)]
*  and Iran. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=480.14000000000004s)]
*  That's what we've got to focus on and keep a very clear eye on, and so we've got—we [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=481.14000000000004s)]
*  want to make sure we stand strong against Iran. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9udSKahmlE&t=484.98s)]
