**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg)
*  We continue to have and will maintain the capability to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=0.0s)]
*  Protect ourselves and defend ourselves as we continue to complete the retrograde [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=4.72s)]
*  That update from the Pentagon just a few minutes ago as we watch a dangerous race to the finish this morning in Afghanistan US evacuations [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=9.06s)]
*  Pressing forward with less than 24 hours into the deadline to withdraw now the US troops who have been protecting evacuees [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=16.86s)]
*  Those troops are leaving themselves our Pentagon correspondent Courtney QB is at her post there at the Pentagon and our foreign correspondent [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=24.54s)]
*  Matt Bradley is at Ramstein Air Base in Germany Courtney [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  Let's start with you the next 24 hours on the ground there in Kabul [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=34.36s)]
*  What would what are they going to look like and what should we expect to see after that? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=38.7s)]
*  So we should expect the last US troops and US diplomatic personnel to leave by this deadline [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=43.7s)]
*  There is no change to the mission to the plan to have everyone out by this August 31st deadline [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=49.42s)]
*  And as you mentioned Craig, we're only hours away from August 31st there in Kabul [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=54.74s)]
*  So we are we are really truly in love the final hours of this mission [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=60.56s)]
*  the other thing that we can expect to see is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=64.38000000000001s)]
*  The vast amount of US military equipment that's there on the ground at Kabul Airport [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=67.5s)]
*  We can expect that either of them to try to move some of that out or try to disable it before the US leaves [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=72.48s)]
*  And that could take several different ways that we that could look several different ways [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=78.22000000000001s)]
*  They could conduct some controlled detonations that would be blowing stuff up in place or they could disable disable things before they go [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=82.06s)]
*  One piece of equipment that we know is on the ground there right now is what the military calls a CRAM [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  It's a counter rocket and mortar [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=94.66000000000001s)]
*  System it was employed over the weekend when ISIS K fired at least five rockets at Hamid Karzai [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=97.58000000000001s)]
*  International Airport the CRAM was able to take out at least one of those rockets [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=105.1s)]
*  There were no reported casualties on the airport [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=108.98s)]
*  But that just underscores how important some of these systems are in these final hours to protect US troops and US civilians as they're [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=111.94s)]
*  Getting ready to leave Kabul, Craig [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=119.84s)]
*  You [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H7g91MQzg&t=134.94s)]
