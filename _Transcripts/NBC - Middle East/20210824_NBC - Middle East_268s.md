# Veteran: 'I Really Worry That It Might Now Be Open Season On The U.S.'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s)
*  Joining me now, one of the people who's behind this, Afghan and Afghanistan veteran and former CIA [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=0.0s)]
*  analyst, Matt Zeller. Matt, it's good to see you again. Let me start first with the breaking news [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=4.4s)]
*  this morning that the CIA director sat down with the Taliban. Does that give you any hope? What's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=10.32s)]
*  your take on that? Yeah, I mean, it's a weird time to be in, right? The guy was in prison, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=16.0s)]
*  and I was for a couple of years, and now we're talking to him, but that's just how an end of a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=22.56s)]
*  war that you lose goes, I guess. Look, I'm hoping that they're making a deal. It's very clear that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=26.96s)]
*  the devil's arithmetic does not have us being able to evacuate not just even all of our Afghans, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=33.84s)]
*  but all of the Americans by the 31st of August. The Association of Wartime Allies puts out a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=39.28s)]
*  daily tracker, and we haven't updated it yet for today, but as of yesterday, we were going to take [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=44.64s)]
*  to at least September the 21st to complete this evacuation at the current pace of withdrawal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=50.56s)]
*  We want to be able to take everybody. We don't want to leave a single person behind, and I've [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=56.96s)]
*  got to be honest, I think that the fact that we're now sending the director of the Central [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=60.64s)]
*  Intelligence Agency to try to make a deal with the Taliban shows that the Biden administration [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=64.64s)]
*  hopefully finally understands that they're going to be judged by one number and one number alone [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=69.76s)]
*  for the rest of history, and that's how many people did we leave behind. Now, how many people [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=74.64s)]
*  did we save? How many people did we leave behind? Because let's be clear, the president has got to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=79.44s)]
*  stop gaslighting the country. We could have done this in a very orderly fashion. A plan existed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=84.16s)]
*  all along. It's on a website. It's called EvacuateOurAllies.org. We tried to give it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=90.0s)]
*  to the administration as early as February. Had they listened to us, we wouldn't have been in this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=94.64s)]
*  situation, and also if the Trump administration hadn't purposely shut down this program for four [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=99.12s)]
*  years, we wouldn't have all of these people that we needed to take at the last moment. If the visa [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=103.92s)]
*  program had actually functioned as designed, many of them would have gotten out years ago. So there's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=108.56s)]
*  a lot of blame to go around on both sides of the aisle and with leadership, but what we now need to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=113.28s)]
*  focus is the president has to keep this beachhead open. I mean, these people are right there. They're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=118.8s)]
*  at the gates. We can take them. We just need a little bit more time. Yeah. So tell us from your [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=124.56s)]
*  perspective, what is the Biden administration not doing? What does it need to do in order to get [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  everybody out? First thing is they have to commit to mission complete, not at an arbitrary date [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=136.08s)]
*  that's set by the Taliban in the future. Again, we should not have been negotiating with these [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=141.76s)]
*  people. They're not a legitimate government. I get that they've militarily taken control and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=146.32s)]
*  that that's the reality on the ground, but we're still the most powerful country on the planet, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=151.28s)]
*  and I really do fear that if we commit to their date, what does that say to our ability to stand [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=154.88s)]
*  up to Russia and China going forward? I really worry that it might now be open season on the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=160.56s)]
*  United States if we can let the Taliban push us around. But the other thing is that this entire [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=165.6s)]
*  time, the Biden administration has been plagued with this problem called throughput. We simply [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=170.88s)]
*  have only one runway in all of Afghanistan to work with, and we at the very beginning of this did not [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  have a lot of other runways on upon which to land. And so very quickly, the ability to bring people [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=182.16s)]
*  to Qatar ended because we just ran out of space to put people. So then we had to go hat in hand [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=188.72s)]
*  all over the world, asking any country, will you take our Afghans? Will you take our Afghans? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=194.64s)]
*  When this entire time the island of Guam sits ready to welcome these people, they have tens of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=199.44s)]
*  thousands of vacant hotel rooms because their economy is dependent on tourism and has been [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=205.68s)]
*  decimated by COVID, their government as early as June officially reached out to the Biden [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=210.8s)]
*  administration and requested that the island be used for exactly this purpose. And still not a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=216.32s)]
*  single Afghan has been evacuated to Guam. I don't understand why the administration has such a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=222.8s)]
*  profound resistance to using what is clearly a major solution to a massive problem that if they [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=228.56s)]
*  just took it, we could actually begin moving people a lot quicker because we'd have another [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=235.12s)]
*  place to bring them. We'd have way more capacity to actually assist people. We could start flying [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=239.6s)]
*  more planes. I mean, this is just, it's a matter of logistics and math. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F3gKaz0_1s&t=244.4s)]
