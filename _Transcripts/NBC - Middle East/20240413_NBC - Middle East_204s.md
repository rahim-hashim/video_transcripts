# Iran launches drone attacks against Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA)
*  I want to bring in NBC once again for correspondent Josh Latterman standing by for us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=0.0s)]
*  Josh, bring us up to date. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=4.68s)]
*  What more are we learning? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=6.08s)]
*  Well, Yasmin, we're learning a little bit more from the Israeli military about what [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=7.08s)]
*  has taken place in the last few minutes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=10.6s)]
*  The IDF now says that multiple drones were launched from Iranian territory toward Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=13.4s)]
*  Now, as Aaron David Miller was correctly saying, and the IDF is now echoing, it's going to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=20.72s)]
*  take several hours for those drones to actually arrive in the vicinity of Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=25.68s)]
*  But in the meantime, the Israeli military and its air force are now undertaking what [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=31.8s)]
*  they are calling a defensive operation. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=36.96s)]
*  They are implementing what they are calling an orderly plan to deal with this, including [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=40.2s)]
*  both air force fighter jets as well as Navy assets that are now being deployed to defend [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=45.52s)]
*  Israeli territory. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=51.6s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=52.6s)]
*  It means shooting down those drones, of course. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=54.04s)]
*  And part of what Israel is also trying to do is make it harder for those drones to successfully [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=56.24s)]
*  reach their destination. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=61.92s)]
*  And so the Israeli military announcing that GPS may be disabled in certain areas because, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=62.92s)]
*  of course, they may suspect that those Iranian drones may utilize GPS targeting to be able [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=68.8s)]
*  to get to the places that they are intended to go. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=75.44s)]
*  As well as disabling GPS, the Israeli military is now urging the public to really closely [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=79.08s)]
*  follow some of those orders to civilians that we discussed a little bit earlier, including [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=85.68s)]
*  the shutdown of large gatherings. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=91.76s)]
*  They are telling people that if they hear an alarm, they need to go into their safe [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=94.88s)]
*  area for a minimum of 10 minutes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=99.08s)]
*  They are really urging people to be very cautious. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=101.36s)]
*  But really, we should point out there are a few major things we don't know at this point. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=104.12s)]
*  Yes, and of course, how many drones were launched, whether this is going to be multiple rounds [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  of attacks or whether this was the totality of what Iran is launching today and whether [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  any additional response will include anything other than drones. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  We know that U.S. officials had told NBC News over the last few days that they anticipated [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  that this Iranian strike could also include Iranian missiles, which would be very significant [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=128.08s)]
*  and potentially more difficult for Israel to shoot down. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  We don't have any confirmation yet that any missiles have been involved. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  That is something that the Israelis are going to clearly be paying very close attention to. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=140.55999999999997s)]
*  And of course, we're going to have to wait and see how successful their defensive plans [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=145.2s)]
*  that they have now been telegraphing for so long are in actually dealing with these threats, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=149.64s)]
*  in shooting down those drones, in making sure that they are unable to get to their destination. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=153.88s)]
*  Those are some of the issues that we're going to be watching in this extremely tense period [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  as we know that Iranian drones, as we speak, are in the air making their way toward Israeli territory. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=163.28s)]
*  Truly an unprecedented incident, Yasmin. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHFN2t3dJA&t=169.20000000000002s)]
