# ISIS Attack Recognized Early As Inherent Risk Of Afghanistan Evacuation Mission
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0)
*  Because when the group ISIS claimed responsibility, ISIS-K or ISIS-Khorasan, the Afghanistan affiliate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Islamic State or ISIS, that too was something that we have had repeated explicit [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=5.68s)]
*  and increasingly urgent warnings about from U.S. officials. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=11.52s)]
*  Warnings about that exact threat from that exact group that claimed responsibility for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=15.32s)]
*  what happened today, those warnings started more than a week ago, and they came from U.S. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=19.78s)]
*  officials up to and including the Secretary of State and even the President himself. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=26.0s)]
*  We're also keeping a close watch on any potential terrorist threat at or around the airport, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=31.12s)]
*  including from the ISIS affiliates in Afghanistan who were released from prison when the prisons [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  were emptied. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=44.16s)]
*  And because they are, by the way, it makes everybody understand that the ISIS in Afghanistan [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=46.04s)]
*  are the, have been the sworn enemy of the Taliban. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=52.72s)]
*  There is complexity and there is turbulence on the ground in Kabul. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=55.8s)]
*  And it's very risky and dangerous because there's a genuine threat from ISIS-K. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=60.8s)]
*  That is the reality of what we are up against, and I'm not going to sugarcoat that reality. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  How real is this ISIS threat? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=70.28s)]
*  The threat is real. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=73.56s)]
*  It is acute. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=74.64s)]
*  It is persistent. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=75.88s)]
*  ISIS-K is a sworn enemy of the Taliban, and they have a history of fighting one another. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=76.88s)]
*  But every day we have troops on the ground. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=84.32s)]
*  These troops, innocent civilians at the airport, face the risk of attack from ISIS-K from a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=87.52s)]
*  distance, even though we're moving back the perimeter significantly. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=93.16s)]
*  We are sustaining the highest level of vigilance for an attack against the airport by ISIS-K [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=97.52s)]
*  or another terrorist group. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=103.6s)]
*  They're real and significant challenges that we also have to take into consideration. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=105.56s)]
*  The longer we stay, starting with the acute and growing risk of an attack by a terrorist [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=110.56s)]
*  group known as ISIS-K, an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, which is a sworn enemy of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  the Taliban as well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  Every day we're on the ground, there's another day we know that ISIS-K is seeking to target [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=124.12s)]
*  the airport and attack both U.S. and allied forces and innocent civilians. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=128.56s)]
*  It's hard to overstate the complexity and the danger of this effort. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=134.32s)]
*  We're operating in a hostile environment in a city and country now controlled by the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=139.28s)]
*  Taliban with the very real possibility of an ISIS-K attack. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=143.24s)]
*  We're taking every precaution, but this is very high risk. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=149.96s)]
*  For a week now, up to and including—yesterday with those remarks from Secretary of State [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=155.28s)]
*  Antony Blinken, up to and including overnight last night that urgent directive from the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=159.56s)]
*  U.S. Embassy in Kabul that all Americans should leave the Abbey Gate immediately because of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=164.36s)]
*  a specific threat there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=168.18s)]
*  They have been on this as an increasingly explicit threat of something they believed [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=169.9s)]
*  could and would happen. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  They said they believed it would happen at the airport, it would target U.S. forces, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=178.18s)]
*  it would target innocent civilians at the airport, it would come from ISIS-K. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=181.5s)]
*  The president was explicit that with each passing day that we kept going with these [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=185.22s)]
*  evacuation mission at the airport, an attack like the one we saw today was more likely. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=188.82s)]
*  Would you rather they'd been blindsided? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=197.5s)]
*  They were sounding the alarm that this was the biggest threat to U.S. forces there, and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=199.34s)]
*  it was getting to be a more dangerous threat every day. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  They've obviously been doing everything they could to try to prevent this, but they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=207.9s)]
*  knew it was a possibility. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=210.34s)]
*  The urgency about getting the airlift evacuation mission done and over with has been driven [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=212.86s)]
*  in part, but explicitly by what they clearly and repeatedly reiterated was the risk of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=218.46s)]
*  exactly this kind of attack by exactly this attacker. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=225.26s)]
*  We expect, we didn't, we thought this would happen sooner or later. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=230.62s)]
*  It's tragic that it happened today. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  It's tragic there was this much loss of life. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  We are prepared to continue the mission. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=237.7s)]
*  Joining us now is Congressman Jason Crowe. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=239.66s)]
*  As an Army Ranger in the 82nd Airborne, he served in both the Iraq War and the Afghanistan [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=241.17999999999998s)]
*  Wars. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=244.7s)]
*  I'm struck tonight by the explicitness of the recent warnings we've had from U.S. officials [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=245.7s)]
*  about an attack of exactly this kind. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=252.06s)]
*  I'm struck by the president saying the threat of exactly this kind of attack, which they [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=255.10000000000002s)]
*  knew was a real possibility, has been a big part of why he's committed to limit this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=259.58s)]
*  operation and get out as soon as possible. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=264.02s)]
*  I'm also struck by his simultaneous and now repeated commitment that we won't leave anyone [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=266.62s)]
*  behind. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=271.18s)]
*  I mean, all of those things are coming together into what feels like a very difficult decision [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=272.18s)]
*  tree about what to do hour by hour and day by day. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=277.3s)]
*  What do you hope to happen here, balancing those risks and the commitments that we've [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=281.02s)]
*  made? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=285.7s)]
*  There's no doubt this is hard. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=286.7s)]
*  It's easy to sit here in the comfort of a living room into Monday morning quarterback [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=294.26s)]
*  But I think back to my time as Private Crowe, I think back to my time as a Ranger, as a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=295.26s)]
*  paratrooper, when I was on the ground and it's hot, it's dusty, there's yelling and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=298.62s)]
*  screaming, there's gunshots, there's bomb blasts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=303.97999999999996s)]
*  We're largely sitting here with 18, 19, 20 year old privates and Lance corporals carrying [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=307.22s)]
*  rifles trying to figure this out under very, very difficult circumstances. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=312.66s)]
*  So there is sometimes a huge gap between the intelligence we gather and the information [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=317.66s)]
*  we know and how we can put that into practice on the ground. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  And then that's no reflection on our men and women because they are doing an incredible [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=326.06s)]
*  job. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=329.58000000000004s)]
*  We are asking them to do almost impossible things sometimes, but it's hard and it's imperfect [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  and it's dirty. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=337.26s)]
*  And that's why it's important that as we sit here on the hill in Washington, D.C., and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=338.26s)]
*  we have conversations about these policies, we have to understand that downstream, down [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  range, there's an 18 or 19 year old that has to carry it out. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=348.26s)]
*  So what I hope is that we actually have the tough conversation and we learn from it in [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=352.09999999999997s)]
*  the long term. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=356.78s)]
*  In the near term, we need to protect our troops. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=357.78s)]
*  We need to expand the perimeter that's necessary to protect them. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=359.65999999999997s)]
*  At the same time, we do have an obligation to get U.S. citizens out and as many of our [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=363.58s)]
*  Afghan partners out as we can. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=367.58s)]
*  That is the mission. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=369.9s)]
*  And I don't believe that should have a calendar deadline. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=370.9s)]
*  I think we should pull out when we accomplish that mission. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WqW9kmoQ0&t=373.58s)]
