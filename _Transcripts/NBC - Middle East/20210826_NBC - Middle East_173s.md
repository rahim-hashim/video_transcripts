**NBC - Middle East:** [August 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc)
*  These American service members who gave their lives — it's an overused word, but it's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=0.0s)]
*  totally appropriate here — were heroes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  They're a part of an airlift, an evacuation effort unlike any seen in history, with more [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=18.16s)]
*  than 100,000 American citizens, American partners, Afghans who helped us, and others taken to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=24.54s)]
*  safety in the last 11 days. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=36.06s)]
*  Just in the last 12 hours or so, another 7,000 have gotten out. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=41.22s)]
*  They're a part of the bravest, most capable, the most selfless military on the face of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  the earth. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=50.74s)]
*  And they're a part of simply what I call the backbone of America. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=52.900000000000006s)]
*  They're the spine of America, the best the country has to offer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=57.06s)]
*  Jill and I are heartache — like I'm sure all of you do as well — for all those Afghan [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=65.06s)]
*  families who have lost loved ones, including small children, or have been wounded in this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=72.5s)]
*  vicious attack. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=77.58s)]
*  And we're outraged as well as heartbroken. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  Being the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and before that was in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=85.14s)]
*  Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=91.26s)]
*  When he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed like many, many coming home [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=98.26s)]
*  with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=108.94s)]
*  We lost. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=114.06s)]
*  We have some sense, like many of you do, what the families of these brave heroes are feeling [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=117.02s)]
*  today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=122.18s)]
*  You get this feeling like you're being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=123.18s)]
*  There's no way out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=130.34s)]
*  My heart aches for you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=133.34s)]
*  But I know this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=137.9s)]
*  We have a continuing obligation — a sacred obligation to all of you — the families [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=141.46s)]
*  of those heroes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=148.22s)]
*  That obligation is not temporary. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=150.38s)]
*  It lasts forever. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwZun4BNxc&t=151.78s)]
