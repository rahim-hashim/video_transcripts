# U.S. airstrikes stir tensions in Iraq and Syria: Expert weighs in
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc)
*  Let's bring in executive director of the McCain Institute, Evelyn Farkas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=0.0s)]
*  She is the former senior adviser to the Supreme Allied Commander for Europe and the former [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=3.56s)]
*  deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=8.24s)]
*  Hello, welcome. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=11.96s)]
*  I want to pick up on Keir's reference to the Iraqi ministry protest statement, which [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=12.96s)]
*  was, as he noted, blistering, strong in diplomatic terms, what they said here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=17.76s)]
*  But the interesting part for it was the fact that the Sharzad affairs was summoned and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=23.12s)]
*  we don't have right now an ambassador in place to be the U.S. physical presence, if you will, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=32.2s)]
*  because the Sharzad affairs does not have the kind of authority to speak for the president [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=41.16s)]
*  the way an ambassador does. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=44.64s)]
*  How does that dynamic hinder or at least does not harm the conversations with Iraqi leaders [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=46.28s)]
*  relative to what the U.S. wants them to know beyond, oh, this is the military action we're [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=56.36s)]
*  taking? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=62.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, first, Keir, because the language is so important, the subtleties of understanding [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  the language, as Keir said, the Iraqi government is speaking to their domestic audience and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=67.68s)]
*  their power players internally, and they're trying to make sure that their sovereignty [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=73.6s)]
*  is being reflected, that they're not looking weak to their internal domestic audience. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=79.72s)]
*  At the same time, they still rely on the United States. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=85.88s)]
*  They don't want us to leave today or tomorrow, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=88.33999999999999s)]
*  Certainly not unless it's been negotiated. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=91.44s)]
*  And a negotiation like that and the ongoing conversation that might lead to whatever the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=93.72s)]
*  between the United States and Iraq needs to be done really sensitively by somebody who [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=99.4s)]
*  has the ear of the president. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=104.84s)]
*  So you really do want an ambassador there, and so that's a call to the Senate to confirm [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=106.06s)]
*  the person who's been nominated for the position. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  But in the interim, the Sharjah is the person in country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=113.04s)]
*  We know Secretary Blinken is now traveling to the region in terms of he's going to go [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=117.94s)]
*  to the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Israel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=122.28s)]
*  He's going to go to the West Bank. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  He's not going to Iraq. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=128.36s)]
*  Okay, so just how what kind of conversations are currently happening within not just the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=130.28s)]
*  State Department, but between State Department officials, DOD, as again, they try to contain [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=136.44000000000003s)]
*  this conflict from escalating even further. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=142.8s)]
*  Well, Simone, you put the you put the pinpoint on where we should be really paying attention, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=146.0s)]
*  which is the diplomacy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=150.44000000000003s)]
*  What is Secretary Blinken doing? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  He's trying really hard, frankly, to bring an end to the current phase of the conflict [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=153.62s)]
*  between Israel and the Hamas terrorists. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=158.16s)]
*  So as fast as he can do that, you know, that will that will move us to a next phase where [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=161.92s)]
*  we are taking hopefully less attacks from the Houthis and the other proxies because [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=167.04s)]
*  they said they're doing this because of the war in Gaza. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=171.0s)]
*  The Israelis, frankly, are conducting an operation now that is using too much force. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=174.64s)]
*  And we have been, I guess, behind the scenes, it sounds like, trying to urge them to bring [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=180.4s)]
*  this to a close. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=185.0s)]
*  So it's now up to the Qataris, the Egyptians, the United States to exercise influence and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=186.12s)]
*  all the power that we have on Israel and on the Gaza, the Hamas terrorists to bring this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=190.84s)]
*  to some kind of conclusion that leads us to a two state solution in the future. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=197.28s)]
*  This all clearly weighing on President Biden. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=201.32s)]
*  There was reporting from before these strikes that when he was meeting privately with his [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=203.8s)]
*  national security aides, he raised a question. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=208.26s)]
*  If he ordered military action to avenge the deaths of three U.S. soldiers in Jordan, would [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=211.58s)]
*  that jeopardize the delicate talks over the release of American hostages in Gaza? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=215.8s)]
*  Of course, his aides assured him it would not end yet. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=220.28s)]
*  It does complicate those talks. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  It totally complicates those talks. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  The good news is, I think, Alicia, that the Iranian government does not want war with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  the United States. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  So I don't think that they're going to respond by escalating the situation by attacking us [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=233.52s)]
*  again or at least condoning or directing an attack by their proxies. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  So that's good. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  However, having said that, the Iranians don't want necessarily peace in Gaza. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=244.04s)]
*  They don't want a détente, if you will, or good relations between Israel and the Gulf [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=249.0s)]
*  States, which is what we were headed towards when this operation by the Gaza terrorists [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  occurred. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  So they are a spoiler. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=260.47999999999996s)]
*  But I think if we can keep things under control in terms of maintaining our deterrence and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=261.88s)]
*  stopping the Iranians from attacking us, we can get to peace. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=267.44s)]
*  It's really important to move fast because there are other parts of the world that are [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=270.92s)]
*  watching, you know, Ukraine, China. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=274.0s)]
*  I want to throw on the table Secretary Lloyd Austin's statement and a very important part [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=277.0s)]
*  of it, I think, for domestic consumption here in the United States where he says, we do [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=282.88s)]
*  not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else, but the president and I will not tolerate [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=287.04s)]
*  attacks on American forces. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  That's something that resonates with Americans across the country, irrespective of the political [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  nonsense that we sometimes hear from hard right individuals. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=297.8s)]
*  From your experience and all of your experience, because you've all kind of touched on this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=303.12s)]
*  space, how does this refashioning of this crisis for the American public rise to a level [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=307.08s)]
*  we talk about escalation in the Middle East, escalating in the political context here in [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=314.16s)]
*  the United States so that Americans do not peel off of this engagement that the U.S. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=318.24s)]
*  finds itself in right now? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=323.44s)]
*  And to add to that, how does Prime Minister Netanyahu play into all of this? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=325.04s)]
*  Someone who has been very clear that he is not for a two-state solution right now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=329.6s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=333.36s)]
*  Well, first, I think, to answer the first question, I think it does focus the American [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=334.36s)]
*  mind like, whoa, you know, Americans were just killed, these young people, you know, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  in the flower, their youth, they're beautiful people, and to learn about them is to really [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=342.0s)]
*  feel sad for the loss of the families. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=346.72s)]
*  And it touches every American. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=349.56s)]
*  And many people have service members in their families, you know, serving overseas. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=352.36s)]
*  And so it is a wake-up call to Americans that when we are out in the world, we are still [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=355.76s)]
*  the dominant power, and the bad guys will attack us, and it could cause a loss of life. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=360.24s)]
*  So hopefully what it means is that they'll pay more attention and support our government [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=364.76s)]
*  in establishing deterrence to make sure that we aren't attacked. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=368.72s)]
*  They'll understand that it's important to have a strong defense and a strong foreign [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=372.32s)]
*  policy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=375.68s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense speaks, you know, he doesn't speak a lot, but when he speaks, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  he does it in a really decisive, no-nonsense fashion, which I think helps the president. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=381.52s)]
*  Getting to Netanyahu, look, I think the demonstration of power that we exercised last night is also [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=386.32s)]
*  a demonstration of power vis-à-vis Netanyahu. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=392.16s)]
*  Like, don't mess around with us. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=394.16s)]
*  You're not listening to us. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=396.08s)]
*  We want to bring this to an end, and you are not acting as a good-faith actor, I would [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=397.12s)]
*  argue. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=402.8s)]
*  I think for the administration, he's a frustrating character because he's got his own agenda [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=403.8s)]
*  politically and personally. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  To say the least. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=409.88s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=410.88s)]
*  Evelyn Farkas, I mean, thank you, first of all, for getting up early, coming in, and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=411.88s)]
*  just unpacking the things, because this is critical and so important. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=415.76s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=419.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ah4XFKiyc&t=433.8s)]
