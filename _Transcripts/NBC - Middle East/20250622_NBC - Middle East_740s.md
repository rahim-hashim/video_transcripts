# ‘I don’t think [Iran] will come to the table anytime soon’: Fmr. U.S. Envoy to Iran on U.S. strike
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4)
*  This was an incredible military success. I think you wouldn't assume that the Iranian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=0.0s)]
*  nuclear program is at an end, but there's been a devastating impact on their ability [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=8.32s)]
*  to develop a weapon, possibly for as long as a year or longer. They did achieve total [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=14.56s)]
*  surprise. A lot of that may also have entailed striking these facilities when there were [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  hundreds of nuclear technicians at work trying to dismantle and hide fissile material or [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=27.42s)]
*  technology. So it was remarkable. Obviously, the big question is, can this lead to a negotiated [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=35.1s)]
*  outcome? Can the Iranians not attack U.S. forces in the region, precipitating a wider war? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=44.74s)]
*  And then finally, is there some way to get the International Atomic Energy Agency back on the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=54.13999999999999s)]
*  ground? That's the only way you can actually prevent the Iranians from starting up their [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=62.98s)]
*  production process again. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=68.78s)]
*  Robert, can you answer the general's first question there as to if there is a possibility [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=71.3s)]
*  for a negotiated diplomatic response? And if so, what are their options? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=75.78s)]
*  There's a set of very good questions. But at this point, I think it's extremely difficult to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=83.89999999999999s)]
*  imagine Iran coming back to the negotiating table. First, I'm not sure what they'd be [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  negotiating. I mean, they have lost the bulk of their nuclear program, and that's what's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=91.74s)]
*  their leverage in the negotiations. So my aunt, they also feel deeply, deeply betrayed, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=95.46s)]
*  rightly or wrongly, because maybe they should never have trusted him by President Trump, given [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=100.5s)]
*  what they thought was several indications that he was prepared to try the path of diplomacy and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=105.14s)]
*  then this this strike. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=111.42s)]
*  So I think for now, the best we could hope for is that Iran will simply stay quiet and wait [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=113.34s)]
*  for better days. I don't think that they're going to be coming to the table anytime soon, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  certainly to negotiate with the United States. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=123.06s)]
*  And Robert, Vice President Vance today asserting we're not at war with Iran, we're at war with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=125.7s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program. I'm curious how you see this framing and will it be a distinction that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=130.54s)]
*  matters in the eyes of Iran? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=136.14s)]
*  I mean, it's a nice formulation, but no, it doesn't it doesn't make any sense. I mean, I think [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=138.1s)]
*  the always the best way to think of these situations is to put yourself in the other person's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=144.42s)]
*  shoes and to imagine how we would react. I don't think that if any country were to attack our [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  nuclear other installations, we'd be prepared to say, well, they're not at war with us, but with [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=153.26s)]
*  the with the assets that they targeted. No, certainly Iran doesn't view it that way. Not clear [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=157.14s)]
*  that they have many good response options, but certainly, as you said, as one of your [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  correspondents said earlier, they have a long memory. And I think this movie has just begun. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  Javid, I'd like to get your insights having worked with the Trump administration. Your reaction, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  sir, to who was informed about these strikes before it happened, because the majority of Congress [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=178.98s)]
*  seemingly was left in the dark, with the exception of four Republicans. Does any of that seem [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  unusual to you? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=189.66s)]
*  Hi, Alex doesn't seem that unusual. And as General Kane said today, and Secretary Hexhott, this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=191.54s)]
*  was a very compartmented operation that did not have a lot of people in Washington read into it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=198.42s)]
*  until very, very late in the game, or perhaps when the strikes were had were underway, or the planes [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  were returning. And that happens from time to time in national security. And that generally [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=213.22s)]
*  tends to be the right thing to do, because you want to protect the operation. Now, on the back [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=218.66s)]
*  end, it sounds like there was some type of political divide in terms of reporting. But I also [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=222.34s)]
*  have to think that through the NSC process and working with the lawyers there and the White House [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=228.42s)]
*  lawyers, that they came up with a legal justification where this didn't require any other type of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=233.06s)]
*  congressional approval or authorization. And therefore, the president operating under his [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=240.1s)]
*  Article 2 powers as commander, and she could go forward and do this, and then on the back end to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=246.02s)]
*  satisfy War Powers Act requirements, notification requirements, that's what it sounds like. That [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=250.58s)]
*  happened in the aftermath of the attack. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=256.74s)]
*  Gabe, it is unclear if National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard was present in the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=259.7s)]
*  Situation Room, and that's based on the photos that we've seen. What do we know about how she [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=264.5s)]
*  was involved in the decision to strike Iran? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  And actually, she was in the Situation Room. That's according to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=272.18s)]
*  White House officials, told my colleague, Von Hilliard. She was in the Situation Room. She [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=277.22s)]
*  probably wasn't in those pictures that were released. But as you point out, Alex, her standing in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=281.86s)]
*  administration has been an open question. Over the last couple of days, multiple sources have told [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  NBC News that she has been essentially sidelined from several of the decisions regarding Israel [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=297.06s)]
*  and Iran, regarding that conflict. And then just on Friday, you heard President Trump say very [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=303.38s)]
*  bluntly that she's wrong when a reporter asked him about her testimony back in March that the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=309.94s)]
*  Ayatollah had not made the decision to move forward with a nuclear weapon. However, her office [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=317.78s)]
*  pushes back on that, and we don't know how influential she was in the Situation Room. We [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=324.74s)]
*  haven't gotten any confirmation of that, but we do know she was there along with other top White [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=330.26s)]
*  House officials and administration officials. Let me ask you, General McCaffrey, how concerned you [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=335.38s)]
*  are, the vulnerability of U.S. troops in the region. How do you assess that? Well, we ought [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  to remind ourselves those 40,000 troops, the significant naval presence, two carrier battle [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=345.54s)]
*  groups, a third one notified to join them. A lot of U.S. air power has moved into both Saudi [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=352.1s)]
*  Arabia, the Gulf Coast states, Italy and the U.K. They are there to put Iran at risk. They're not [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=358.18s)]
*  hostages. So they're an asset that hopefully will leverage in an attempt to get some kind of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=365.94s)]
*  negotiation going. I agree it's unlikely in the short run that the Iranians are going to come back [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  to the table. But in the longer term, perhaps here for months, they almost have no option. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=377.94s)]
*  They're isolated. Russians won't help them. They have no allies. The Sunni Arab nations, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=384.5s)]
*  to a large extent, are delighted that we are knocking back their nuclear program. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=389.46s)]
*  So we'll just have to see. But I think the next 72 hours will be perilous for the Iranians and us. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=396.65999999999997s)]
*  General, I know you have to take off. I want to thank you for your time, sir. The rest of you stay. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=405.14s)]
*  My question next to you, Gabe, we heard some noise behind you there. Are there demonstrations [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=408.98s)]
*  there in Lafayette Park behind you between where you are in that post and the White House? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=414.42s)]
*  Hard to make out here, Alex. But yes, there is a few demonstrators. Hard to get a real feel for [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=419.38s)]
*  how many there are. We see those live pictures potentially out there. So hard to tell really [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=426.66s)]
*  on the ground and from my vantage point, perhaps a few dozen, perhaps. But certainly this is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=434.18s)]
*  something that we expect, that there would be people upset with what the administration is doing, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=440.02000000000004s)]
*  getting the U.S. potentially into this conflict. And again, we see those live pictures right [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=446.82s)]
*  outside the White House. From where I'm standing, I can hear them very muffled in the distance with [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=451.86s)]
*  a loudspeaker trying to make their voices heard outside of the West Wing. But certainly it just [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=456.82s)]
*  seems like a small demonstration at this point right outside the White House. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=462.9s)]
*  Well, I've got to say, I can hear them here in the studio at 30 Rocks. So we heard them [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=466.17999999999995s)]
*  loud and clear. Let me ask you, Javid. We have really good microphones, apparently. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=470.02s)]
*  Yes, you do. Javid, the two-week time frame, was that a ruse by President Trump to lull [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=475.14s)]
*  Iran into some sort of a sense that it had time for diplomatic measures? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=482.5s)]
*  Yeah, Alex, that's another great question. It is very difficult for any of us on the outside [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=487.06s)]
*  to know whether that was indeed the case, but perhaps it actually was an avenue for negotiation. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=491.14s)]
*  And at the same time, there was this parallel track for military planning. And going back a [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=498.5s)]
*  few days, when President Trump came back from the G7 summit early and convened at least one—or [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=504.1s)]
*  there was a convening of one full-up National Security Council meeting in the Situation Room [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=510.82s)]
*  and reporting of a second, that's perhaps where they landed on the military option that was—or [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=514.5s)]
*  one of the military options presented to President Trump with this particular set of strikes. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=520.42s)]
*  It didn't mean that it derailed the potential for negotiations either. And that shows—if [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=525.14s)]
*  that is truly the case, what happened, that shows how flexible the national security process [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=530.9799999999999s)]
*  can operate. But again, that's speculation on my part. I can't confirm or deny whether [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=536.0999999999999s)]
*  that actually happened. Can I ask you, Robert, to speculate on how you believe [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=540.5s)]
*  Iran is looking at this and what you think their next moves will be? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, we could spend a lot of time trying to speculate. Do they attack U.S. bases? Do they [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=553.54s)]
*  try to go after the straight-up Hormuz? Do they withdraw from the nonproliferation treaty? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=557.4599999999999s)]
*  As General McCaffrey said, all of these options are not very good for them because of the potential [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=563.78s)]
*  very disproportionate retaliation by the U.S. But just to take a minute here or a few seconds [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=568.42s)]
*  to think about this, we should not even be in a position where we're asking ourselves what might [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=573.78s)]
*  Iran do in order to retaliate, because there was another way to achieve the goal that Vice President [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=578.3399999999999s)]
*  Vance said just a few hours ago. He said we are now in a position where Iran is far—has a far [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=583.6999999999999s)]
*  longer road to acquire a nuclear weapon than it did only 24 hours ago. There was another way to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=590.26s)]
*  achieve that objective, to achieve that goal, and that was through diplomacy, through negotiations. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=594.66s)]
*  We know that from the experience of 2015, so, yes, it is possible that Iran will react. It's [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=598.98s)]
*  possible they won't react. But the fact that we're in this uncertainty and wondering about [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=603.38s)]
*  what the peril is ahead in the days, weeks, months, perhaps years to come, that I think is [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=607.14s)]
*  an indictment of the path that was chosen as opposed to the path that had been chosen in the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=611.46s)]
*  past and that President Trump and his special envoy appeared to be committed to only a few weeks ago. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=616.42s)]
*  Robin, I'm going to ask you another question. This is a kind of a coulda, woulda, shoulda, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=622.58s)]
*  given the fact that you were the lead negotiator for the 2015 deal that was made, from which [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=626.58s)]
*  President Trump exited the United States. Had that deal been in place all of these years, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=632.98s)]
*  how likely is it we would be in the position we are today? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=640.66s)]
*  Highly unlikely. I mean, it's hard to see why we'd be in this position. I think, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=645.62s)]
*  you know, the main criticism of the deal, which I accept, I think it's still as far better than [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=649.22s)]
*  any of the alternatives that were available, was that at some point around 2030, so a few years [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=653.14s)]
*  from now, the constraints on Iran's nuclear programs would have been far less stringent than [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=657.62s)]
*  they were earlier. So the question was whether a president's successor to President Obama could [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=663.0600000000001s)]
*  have negotiated with Iran a follow-on agreement. But today, if we had, if Iran were still in the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=668.34s)]
*  agreement, we were still in the agreement, Iran would be far, far, far further away from possibly [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=673.7800000000001s)]
*  acquiring a nuclear bomb than they were a week ago, two weeks ago at the time when President Trump [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=679.38s)]
*  rang the alarm bell. So if we had respected that deal, there was every indication, because Iran had [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=685.0600000000001s)]
*  respected it until then, that they would continue because they wanted the benefits [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=690.9s)]
*  of the sanctions relief, I think we'd be in a different world. As you say, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=694.34s)]
*  that's water under the bridge. I wish it weren't the case. But I think it does inform [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=698.26s)]
*  our future approaches, not just to this crisis, but to other crises, when there's a path of diplomacy [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=703.14s)]
*  versus the path of sanctions, pressure coercion and military strikes, we should give a little [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=708.98s)]
*  more time to the first one, diplomacy, before we give it up. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjVBJW4B4y4&t=714.5s)]
