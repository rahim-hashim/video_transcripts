# Aunt to Israeli hostage: 'We will come get you'
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8)
*  Joining us now is Efrat Moskowitz, the aunt of Naama Levy, one of those hostages. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you very much Efrat for being with us today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=6.0s)]
*  It's been more than 400 days, 419 days since your niece was violently taken in that October 7th attack on Israel, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=10.0s)]
*  the massacre that just... anyway. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=23.0s)]
*  And I'm just wondering how you, 420 days later, which is just inconceivable to see how much pain you all are dealing with, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=26.0s)]
*  how do you go forward 420 days in? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=38.0s)]
*  You know, it's like learning to walk again. It's one foot in front of the other every day, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=47.0s)]
*  trying to maintain some kind of routine and then all the efforts alongside, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=55.0s)]
*  trying to get to the decision makers, to the inner circle of the decision makers, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=66.0s)]
*  to implore the leaders to take action. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=72.0s)]
*  It's been 420 days and barely nothing has happened for the release of the remaining hostages. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=79.0s)]
*  And you just get through the day somehow. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=86.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I see the picture of her that's behind you, that you have. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=92.0s)]
*  I'm just wondering, there's been some proof of life since the massacre, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=97.0s)]
*  but what do you know and what are you told and what are the biggest questions that you have? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=104.0s)]
*  There has been a sign of life, but it has been months since the last time we were notified that there's been a sign of life. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=112.0s)]
*  And of course, our greatest worry is how are they surviving there? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=121.0s)]
*  Nama is the sweetest, strongest, determined girl, but it's been 420 days. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=126.0s)]
*  Winter is starting again, second winter in those tunnels. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=135.0s)]
*  What is her physical condition? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=140.0s)]
*  Is she getting any kind of minimal attention, the sanitary conditions? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=144.0s)]
*  All of that is incredibly concerning and frightening, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=151.0s)]
*  We want all of them to survive. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=156.0s)]
*  We wait another day and another day until they're released. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=159.0s)]
*  But with the winter coming, you know, it's frightening. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=164.0s)]
*  Yeah, certainly is. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=169.0s)]
*  I'm just wondering if you think that the ceasefire that Israel reached with Hezbollah through the whole Lebanese thing, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=171.0s)]
*  do you think that that could have an impact on what's going on in Gaza? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=177.0s)]
*  Well, we certainly hope so. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=182.0s)]
*  First, will it bring the attention back to Gaza? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=185.0s)]
*  Will it bring the attention back to Hamas? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=189.0s)]
*  We heard this week that Hamas is ready to come back to the table. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=192.0s)]
*  At least that's what was reported in the media. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=195.0s)]
*  Did we avoid an all-out war in the Middle East? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=200.0s)]
*  This is the time to leverage everything that has happened so far and take action, make that decision. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=205.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's a decision that the Israeli government needs to make to bring them home. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=211.0s)]
*  It's possible to create the conditions for a ceasefire with Lebanon. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=218.0s)]
*  It's possible to create the conditions for a ceasefire with Gaza and bring them all home now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=224.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=229.0s)]
*  Afrat, what do you want to say? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=231.0s)]
*  And I'm just giving you the opportunity to what do you want to say to President Biden? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=234.0s)]
*  What do you want to say to President-elect Trump? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=241.0s)]
*  I'm a dual citizen, and I sat around a Thanksgiving table with friends yesterday [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=244.0s)]
*  being grateful for the community, for the support, for the family. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=251.0s)]
*  And I know a lot of other Americans joined me in that day. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=258.0s)]
*  And in that spirit, with that backdrop, I implore the leadership, this current administration, the next administration. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=264.0s)]
*  There is nothing more important than getting these hostages home. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=271.0s)]
*  They are suffering. They're barely holding on. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=277.0s)]
*  It's been 420 days. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=280.0s)]
*  Put the pressure on the right people, on the right decision makers, and take action. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=282.0s)]
*  It's been way too long. We can't lose another moment. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=288.0s)]
*  And that's my expectation, that it's the number one priority. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=292.0s)]
*  What do you want to say to Nama? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=298.0s)]
*  I miss you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=302.0s)]
*  Your mom misses you, your dad, your siblings. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=304.0s)]
*  We all just want you home and start healing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=308.0s)]
*  And I know you're strong, Nama, and I know you're determined, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=312.0s)]
*  and I know you can take one step at a time, one breath at a time, and we will come get you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=315.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HPKXbe8FS8&t=338.0s)]
