# Trump posts that Iran's leader 'is an easy target' but U.S. will not 'take him out'
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw)
*  President Trump has just posted new comments directed at Iran, aimed at the country's ongoing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=0.0s)]
*  conflict with Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=6.04s)]
*  Here's what he posted on Truth Social just now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  We know exactly where the so-called supreme leader is hiding, obviously a reference to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=11.6s)]
*  the Ayatollah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=16.16s)]
*  He is an easy target, but is safe there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  We are not going to take him out and then in parentheses kill, at least not for now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=20.92s)]
*  We don't want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=27.48s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=31.28s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=33.52s)]
*  I want to bring in NBC's Monica Elba. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=36.72s)]
*  Monica, this follows another posting by the president where he said we have complete and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=39.2s)]
*  total control of the skies over Iran. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=44.64s)]
*  And as we are waiting to hear that there may be a meeting with his national security team, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=48.16s)]
*  what can you tell us about all this? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Well I think a couple things stand out from this, Chris. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=55.16s)]
*  Certainly the language there that you just referenced, we have control over the skies, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=57.31999999999999s)]
*  and then in that post that you just read aloud, our patience is wearing thin. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=62.04s)]
*  I mean all of this is raising the really key question here of what role the U.S. is playing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=65.88s)]
*  or will play in this conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  And the president is obviously taking to social media platform to try to issue some pretty [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=75.64s)]
*  intense warnings and threats here about what, again, the U.S. may or may not do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=80.3s)]
*  And he's using that message and that platform to try to amplify what have been a couple [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=85.58s)]
*  of contradictory stances where in the last couple of days, everybody from his secretary [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=91.1s)]
*  of state to other top officials have said the U.S. is not involved in this except for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=95.78s)]
*  trying to pursue a diplomatic route, which we know right now has hit a dead end. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=101.62s)]
*  And even last night as he was returning from Canada early on Air Force One, he was still [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=106.62s)]
*  trying to talk about this idea that there could be a diplomatic path and that Iran could [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=110.98s)]
*  return to the negotiating table. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=115.58s)]
*  As we know, those talks had been ongoing for the last couple of months. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=118.18s)]
*  But this certainly ratchets it up a little bit to a next level of raising this question [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=120.78s)]
*  again of whether there would be a military action that the U.S. would support or be involved [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=125.78s)]
*  in. And it echoes some reporting from over the weekend that the U.S. and the president [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=131.06s)]
*  rejected a plan by Israel to assassinate the supreme leader, to assassinate the Ayatollah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=136.06s)]
*  So the president's saying that he is arguing again on social media that he has the information, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=142.10000000000002s)]
*  that the U.S. has the intelligence of his whereabouts and the way to go about doing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=148.46s)]
*  that, but that for now he is safe and that that is not what he's doing while in the same [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  breath saying our patience is wearing thin. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=157.9s)]
*  And then he posted a few seconds after that in all capital letters just the words unconditional [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  surrender. So this is a time, Chris, where the president is expected to huddle with his [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=167.34s)]
*  top national security advisers. At some point today, he has nothing else on his public schedule. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=172.78s)]
*  That's what he said he was coming back to deal with, this urgent matter. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=178.62s)]
*  And we understand that he will be huddling with them at some point today, but it's unclear [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=182.22s)]
*  when and what else we'll hear, though it sounds like the first few readouts of everything [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=186.7s)]
*  that's being considered are coming via social media. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Pg3DebnBw&t=190.22s)]
