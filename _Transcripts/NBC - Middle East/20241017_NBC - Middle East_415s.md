# What does Sinwar's death mean for Middle East peace? Ayman reacts
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ)
*  Joining us now MSNBC host Ayman Mouyatine. Ayman, it's really good to have you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  What does it mean for Sinwar to no longer be alive? What does it mean for the Israelis to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=4.4s)]
*  have killed them? Does this change the movement? Does this change things for this war? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=9.68s)]
*  You know, there's two ways to look at it. There's the short term and the long term impact. And in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=15.68s)]
*  the short term, undoubtedly, it is going to change the battlefield dynamics for a few reasons. One, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=19.2s)]
*  Yehi Sinwar was one of these few enigmatic leaders within Hamas who actually had both [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=25.44s)]
*  kind of a tactical as well as a political side to him. He was the chief architect, if you will, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  of the negotiations that were taking place between Israel and the Qataris and the Egyptians and the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=38.88s)]
*  Americans about the release of the hostages. So on the shorthand side of things, the dynamic changes [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  a lot because not only was he inside Gaza, not only was he overseeing some of the operations, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=49.84s)]
*  of the militant group there and the fighters there, but he himself also on the battlefield, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=55.68s)]
*  that now has been eliminated. That's going to disrupt whatever semblance of the organization [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  remains inside the Gaza Strip. Does it change the organization fundamentally? What we have seen in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=64.32s)]
*  the past, Katie, a short answer to that is it has not. There have been other senior leaders [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=69.44s)]
*  of Hamas, spiritual leaders, political leaders that have been killed. And the organization manages [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=75.2s)]
*  to elect new leaders, generate new leadership that tends to be more extreme, more hardline, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=80.4s)]
*  more militant than the generation before. So again, it's too early to see what Hamas does. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=85.76s)]
*  They have not officially made any comments about the killing of Sinwar early today, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=90.72s)]
*  but we'll see what they do in the coming days and weeks and whether or not they reelect the new [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  political leaders. Can you give any insight on the Qatari side of things? Because they've been the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=99.76s)]
*  mediator between the Israelis and Hamas. Do they change their negotiating position? Do they [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=103.92s)]
*  try to put more pressure on Israel, more pressure on the United States to put pressure on Israel? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=111.68s)]
*  How do they factor into this? Well, they've always tried to maintain the position of being [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=116.72s)]
*  intermediaries. Certainly the Israelis have questioned whether their motivations have been [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=121.92s)]
*  purely as intermediaries or not. The Americans have trusted Qatari mediation in the past. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=126.16s)]
*  They have proven to be quite reliable in many different fields, if you will, including [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=130.96s)]
*  Afghanistan and elsewhere for the Americans. But when it comes to this issue, they've also had the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=134.96s)]
*  trust of Hamas' leadership, which, as you and our viewers know, has been mostly in Doha for the past [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=139.28s)]
*  several years. So as a result of that, they've had some leverage over Hamas. But at the same time, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=144.96s)]
*  they've also had working relations with the Israelis. A lot of the money that was going [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=150.56s)]
*  into Hamas through Gaza was going with the blessing of the Israeli government, with the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=154.96s)]
*  direct knowledge of the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. How this changes right now [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=159.52s)]
*  is really dependent on the organization, whether the organization chooses a more moderate leader [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=164.56s)]
*  or somehow changes its position on some of the negotiations that have taken place over the last [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  several months. One of the key cornerstone demands of Hamas has been that any release of hostages [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=174.96s)]
*  inside Gaza has to be conditioned on the end of the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  and forces from inside the Gaza Strip to the outside. That has been a categorical no [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  from Israel. They said they were not going to do that before the killing of Sinwar. So it's going [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=191.28s)]
*  to be interesting to say the very least as to whether or not either side demonstrates some [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  flexibility. What about the Jordanians? The other day when I had you on, we were talking about the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=201.84s)]
*  Jordanian foreign minister who was reacting to Benjamin Netanyahu here at the United Nations, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=205.76s)]
*  saying that Netanyahu was saying there was a ring of fire around Israel. And the Jordanian foreign [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  minister came out and said, we can guarantee Israel's safety, the Gulf states, the states [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=214.72s)]
*  surrounding Israel, if they come to a ceasefire. How are the Jordanians factoring into this? And [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=220.72s)]
*  might they now play a larger role given what the foreign minister said just a few days ago? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=227.28s)]
*  Well, you know, one of the issues, Katie, and you know this better than others in the region, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=233.12s)]
*  so much of this is about narrative, right? And so for many years, the Israeli narrative has been the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=236.64s)]
*  reason why we do X, Y, and Z is because we are surrounded by a sea of hostile nations that want [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=241.76s)]
*  to destroy us. And they have pointed to groups like Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran as examples of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=247.92s)]
*  those types of forces that want to destroy Israel. And so what the Jordanian foreign minister [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  was saying with that statement was that the truth is these groups, and certainly now after the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=258.64s)]
*  killing of somebody like Yahya Sinwar as well as the killing of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=263.84s)]
*  was that this narrative is no longer the dominant narrative, that the countries of the Arab world [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=268.24s)]
*  that include moderate countries like Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=273.12s)]
*  all of these countries, even Saudi Arabia potentially, Morocco as well, have all come to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=278.08s)]
*  the realization that Israel is there. They're going to have peace treaties with Israel, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=283.44s)]
*  that Israel is no longer this country surrounded by a sea of hostile states that want to destroy it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=287.68s)]
*  So the excuse or the justification that Israel has over the years undertaken for why it treats [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=292.48s)]
*  the Palestinians the way it does, why it maintains the occupation, why it does what it does, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=298.16s)]
*  is no longer as strong as it was decades ago. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=302.32s)]
*  I'm wondering, can those states though, can they guarantee safety if you don't have, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=305.6s)]
*  you have non-state actors that have been going after Israel, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=311.04s)]
*  and Iran, which is obviously a state actor, but basically trying to do their, to wage their war [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  through proxies. Can those surrounding states guarantee Israel's safety with these proxies that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=320.8s)]
*  are there to continue the fight? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=326.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, yes and no. On one hand, you look at the Jordanians, they shot down some of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=329.44s)]
*  Iranian missiles that were heading towards Israel a couple of months ago. And they say they did that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=332.88s)]
*  because Iran was violating Jordanian airspace, but nonetheless, they did participate in what is [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=336.64s)]
*  widely seen an act of defense on behalf of Israel and certainly with the help of the Americans and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=341.76s)]
*  others in the region. But the underlying issue the Jordanians point to is that the biggest threat to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=347.04s)]
*  Israel's security is not what is happening externally. It's the fact that the Israelis [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=352.64s)]
*  till this day maintain an occupation. And they point to October 7th as an example of that, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  saying that the reason why Hamas continues to exist, the reason why there is this resentment [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=361.44s)]
*  is because decades of occupation have resulted in this festering sense of groups like Hamas. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=366.08s)]
*  And so as a result of that, so long as you don't address that core issue, nothing on the periphery [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=373.12s)]
*  is going to be resolved, including countries like Iran, which people criticize for exploiting the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=377.44s)]
*  Palestinian issue for them going to exploit the Palestinian issue for their own self-interest, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=382.32s)]
*  not necessarily caring about the Palestinian cause per se. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=387.04s)]
*  It does feel like it could be an inflection point for change. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=390.24s)]
*  Ayman Moideen, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=393.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqxH47fZXwQ&t=412.32s)]
