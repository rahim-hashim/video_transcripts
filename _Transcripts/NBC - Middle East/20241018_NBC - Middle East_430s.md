# ‘Discouraging situation’ in Gaza ‘has no answer’ with no ceasefire in sight: Retired General
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg)
*  General, I've been waiting to speak with you as a consequence of what happened here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=0.0s)]
*  What did you see here? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=5.16s)]
*  Well, profoundly, we see that the Hamas chain of command has disintegrated, that Sinwar [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=7.44s)]
*  had, at the end of his days, had zero ability to see the battlefield, to coordinate events, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=16.56s)]
*  to govern in any way the civilian population, a couple of million Palestinians now living [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=25.06s)]
*  in a devastated environment. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=31.18s)]
*  So I think what we've got now is an organization, maybe 10, 15,000 fighters remaining, autonomous, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=32.98s)]
*  conducting guerrilla operations, representing much less of a threat to Israel, maybe 20% [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=43.66s)]
*  of what they were prior to 7 October. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=51.18s)]
*  And the Israelis, facing a seven-front war, as they say, appear to be dominating and reestablishing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=54.42s)]
*  deterrence. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=61.82s)]
*  The problem is they need to break out of this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=62.82s)]
*  Israelis cannot govern Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=66.94s)]
*  There has to be some pan-Arab solution, not the U.S. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=69.9s)]
*  We should absolutely not take part in a peacekeeping operation in Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=74.9s)]
*  Heights. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=80.7s)]
*  But I think Netanyahu's got an opportunity for perhaps a unilateral ceasefire, maybe, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=82.7s)]
*  to try and get the hostages back. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=89.02s)]
*  But otherwise, the war grinds on. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=90.97999999999999s)]
*  You know, General, I just spoke to an IDF spokesperson earlier on my earlier program [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=93.06s)]
*  here on MSNBC today, and I asked him, I said, listen, you've taken out number one, you've [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=99.66s)]
*  pretty much decimated the entire Hamas infrastructure. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=105.1s)]
*  You also did that with Hezbollah, but that's another issue. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=109.38s)]
*  But focusing on Hamas, that's devastated. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=113.02s)]
*  You guys have won the war. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=116.33999999999999s)]
*  Why not say we won the war? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=119.02s)]
*  Done. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=121.82s)]
*  And he said for 101 reasons, and that's the 101 hostages that are still being kept in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=122.82s)]
*  Hamas either hands or in some allied group's hands. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=131.18s)]
*  How does this war end, General? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=136.5s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's going to end. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=139.02s)]
*  I think we're in a terrible dilemma in which violence will continue. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=142.38s)]
*  These voices of Hamas that are in the Gulf states or in Iran are completely disconnected [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=148.18s)]
*  from the remnants of Hamas battalions fighting in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=156.54000000000002s)]
*  They've still got probably a lot of ammunition left. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  They're almost out of missiles to attack Israel with. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=163.86s)]
*  They have no chain of command. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  There's no reason for them to stop fighting. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=170.10000000000002s)]
*  There's still access to food and cover. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=172.58s)]
*  I think it's a very discouraging situation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=178.18s)]
*  It's possible Israelis can make a unilateral move which would allow them better opportunity [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=180.26000000000002s)]
*  to offer rewards, cash, the ability to leave the Gaza Strip and get some or all of their [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=187.34s)]
*  hostages back, the ones who remain alive, which is a very dubious situation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=195.14s)]
*  But look, at the end of the day, the Israelis have to talk about the day after the end of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=200.54s)]
*  the war. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=206.06s)]
*  And a unilateral ceasefire that also involves releasing thousands of Hamas fighters and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  withdrawing from the Gaza Strip is not going to happen. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=215.22s)]
*  Unfortunately, President Biden and Vice President Harris have said the same thing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=219.58s)]
*  They cannot reengage with Hamas at the end of this conflict. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=224.94s)]
*  So what's the solution? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=229.06s)]
*  There's none on the table. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=230.06s)]
*  The Arab states are not stepping up to it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=231.9s)]
*  I noticed Secretary Lloyd Austin in NATO talked about NATO's potential participation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=234.58s)]
*  They're in a NATO nation that would touch us with an 11-foot pole. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=240.82s)]
*  So it's sort of a grim situation without an obvious answer. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=245.78s)]
*  And General, finally, we talked about Hezbollah also, its leadership being decimated. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=251.22s)]
*  We're talking about possibly hundreds or thousands of the top, middle, and even low level organization [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=256.18s)]
*  has been wiped out in the last couple of weeks alone. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  So where does Iran now stand? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=267.18s)]
*  Hezbollah essentially wiped out leadership. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=271.74s)]
*  Hamas essentially wiped out. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=274.46s)]
*  The Houthis are, you know, the U.S. is actually fighting, you know, hitting them as well. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=275.82s)]
*  What does Iran have left? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=282.82s)]
*  And what happens when Iran finds itself essentially cornered and insignificant? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=285.58s)]
*  Well, Houthi, I think you make an important point. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=291.58s)]
*  Actually, the turning point isn't Sinwar in Gaza dying without, you know, two gunmen [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=296.14s)]
*  fleeing from them. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=302.86s)]
*  The turning point may be Iran trying to rethink what they're going to do. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  They're scrambling to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=310.46s)]
*  I think they're going to be a nuclear state guaranteed within a year. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  But at the same time, they've seen their surrogates being devastated. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  They understand that the IDF, the Israeli Air Force, could go after their economic oil [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=323.26000000000005s)]
*  industry and devastate it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  They could take down the nuclear abilities if they had a year or so to work on it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=332.3s)]
*  There aren't good options for Iran, but they're still hanging 20, 30 people a month internally [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=339.1s)]
*  to maintain control. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  So it's possible, one could assume, that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Coast states, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=347.7s)]
*  Jordan would start talking to the Shiite Muslim Iranian leadership and try and say, look, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=352.9s)]
*  we need to stabilize the region. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  The advantage is in the favor of the Israelis. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=363.02s)]
*  We got to come up with a new strategy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  Let's hope that's the case. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=368.41999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Blinken has been relentless in seeking peace. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=370.9s)]
*  Maybe the Arabs will now step forward and try and argue with the Iranians, let's stop [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=376.08s)]
*  this war. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  And what a tragedy has befallen Iran, the Persian people, just because of this regime [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  that has been in power since 1979 and, as you point out, continues to shed the blood [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=390.52s)]
*  of its own people in its attempts to stay there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  What a tragedy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=405.24s)]
*  General Barry McAlferty, it's always a pleasure to see you. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=406.24s)]
*  I thank you for your time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su9kX23bZCg&t=408.36s)]
