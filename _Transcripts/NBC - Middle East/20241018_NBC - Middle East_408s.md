# State Dept Spokesman calls Hamas leader’s death a ‘turning point’ in Israel-Gaza conflict
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4)
*  As now to the death of Hamas leader Yaya Sinwar, yesterday Israeli Defense Forces posted this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=0.0s)]
*  on social media announcing they've eliminated the head of the terrorist organization. Israeli [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=7.12s)]
*  troops found Sinwar by chance in southern Gaza on Wednesday, ending a year-long search for the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=13.6s)]
*  man believed to be the architect of the October 7th attack. Officials say troops were patrolling [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  an area of Rafa when they noticed three terrorists fleeing. The two sides then engaged in gunfire [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=27.2s)]
*  and all three militants were killed. It was only then that Israeli forces suspected one of those [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=34.56s)]
*  terrorists might be Yaya Sinwar. The IDF later ran DNA tests to confirm his identity. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=41.12s)]
*  Joining us now, State Department spokesman Matt Miller. Matt, thanks for coming on the show. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=49.04s)]
*  Talk about the significance of this latest development, but now the implications in front [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=54.56s)]
*  of us, the hostages, also potential retaliation. What is the United States and Israel preparing for? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=60.64s)]
*  Well, good morning, Mieke. First of all, thanks for having me. The death of Yaya Sinwar is a hugely [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  significant moment for the region, for the world. This is someone who is a brutal, vicious terrorist [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  who had the blood of Americans on his hands, who had the blood of Israelis, who had the blood of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=81.2s)]
*  more than 30 citizens, the citizens of 30 countries around the world on his hands. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=86.08s)]
*  It was his decision to unleash this war on October 7th that has now cost the lives of over 40,000 [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=91.28s)]
*  Palestinians. And in the past few months, he has been the chief obstacle to ending that war [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=98.4s)]
*  and alleviating the suffering of those Palestinians, to getting the hostages home, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=104.64s)]
*  to providing real security for Israel and for the Palestinian people alike. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=108.32s)]
*  If you go back to the ceasefire proposal that President Biden laid out at the end of May, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  obviously you saw after that a series of negotiations. You saw the United Nations [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  Security Council endorse it. And what happened over the past few weeks, a little over a month, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  is that Hamas, under Sinwar's leadership, just walked away from the bargaining table and refused [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=126.08s)]
*  to negotiate at all. And so we see this now as an opportunity with him being eliminated, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  with him being gone, as a chance to push forward, to try to get an agreement to end this war, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=136.48s)]
*  to try to get an agreement to finally get those 101 hostages who still remain in Gaza home to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=141.76s)]
*  their families, and to try to finally push for real lasting security for the Israeli and Palestinian [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=147.12s)]
*  people alike. And that's what we're going to be pushing for with urgency in the days ahead. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=153.2s)]
*  Matt, I understand that you see this as an opportunity, and perhaps even for some sort [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  of longer-term negotiations over who might be in charge of security of Gaza. But just in the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=161.12s)]
*  short term, in the next kind of few days, is there also some concern at the State Department [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=167.04s)]
*  that this might be a moment of peril, particularly for the hostages, if Sinwar is dead—now Sinwar is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=171.28s)]
*  dead, and we don't really know who is running things in Hamas and who negotiations would take [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  place with to have some kind of hostage exchange? Look, we are always concerned [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=181.2s)]
*  danger presented to the hostages. We've been incredibly concerned about that since October 7. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=187.28s)]
*  If you look back at what happened then, Hamas, under Sinwar's leadership, took more than 250 [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=192.16s)]
*  hostages—little boys and girls, children, the elderly. There are 101 who are remaining, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=197.76s)]
*  including seven Americans who still remain in hostage, who still remain held hostage in Gaza, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  and we are always worried about their safety and security, which is why we're working to try and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=208.96s)]
*  end the war and bring them home. What we're going to be doing in the next few days—so [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=213.36s)]
*  after Sinwar's death was announced yesterday, the Secretary Blinken got on the phone immediately [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  with the Prime Minister of Qatar, who has been one of the chief intermediaries in negotiating an [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  end to this war, negotiating a ceasefire agreement. He got on the phone with the foreign minister of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=228.8s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, and in the coming days, as President Biden announced yesterday, he'll be returning to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  the region to try to push forward for an agreement to end this war and get those hostages home. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=238.88s)]
*  Ultimately, we believe the best way to secure those hostages is for an agreement to end the war [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  that brings them home safely to their families, their loved ones. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=249.12s)]
*  Matt, good morning. We heard from both President Biden and Vice President Harris in the aftermath [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=252.64s)]
*  of Sinwar's death, both making it very clear that now is the time for this war to end, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=257.12s)]
*  now is the time for a ceasefire deal, now is the time to bring those hostages home. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=261.36s)]
*  However, Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel last night did not suggest that the conflict would end [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=265.52s)]
*  anytime soon and said, in fact, it would continue. How confident are you right now, the State [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  Department of the United States, that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to make this deal? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  Look, that's a conversation we're going to have with him directly. The president spoke to him [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  yesterday. As I said, Secretary Blinken will be returning to the region next week, and this will [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  be a conversation that we expect to have directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Israel achieved an [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=288.88s)]
*  incredibly important strategic objective yesterday. The elimination of Yahya Sinwar [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=294.32s)]
*  was an important objective, number one, to bring him to justice for the blood that he had on his [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=298.64s)]
*  hands, not just on October 7th, but in the months after and in the years leading up to October 7th. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=303.92s)]
*  They have other strategic objectives they need still to accomplish, and one of them is returning [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=309.68s)]
*  all the hostages. And then, ultimately, the most important objective for Israel should be [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=313.36s)]
*  lasting security for the people of Israel. And it is our belief that an endless conflict in Gaza, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=318.56s)]
*  which is what you will have if you don't have an agreement for a political path forward for the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  Palestinian people, if you don't have an agreement for real security inside Gaza and reconstruction [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=329.28s)]
*  in Gaza and a plan to allow the people of Gaza to rebuild their lives, you're never going to have [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  lasting security for the people of Israel as well. So the conversation that we expect to have with [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=339.2s)]
*  them in the coming days is the best way to move that forward. As you know, and I think you allude [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=344.24s)]
*  to it in your question, we had some tough decisions that we were putting to Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=349.2s)]
*  over the course of these ceasefire negotiations, and he was going to have to make some tough [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=354.08s)]
*  decisions to find an end to this war, to bring the hostages home. That process kind of got [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=357.36s)]
*  short-circuited when Sinwar walked away from the bargaining table. We now see this as an opportunity [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=361.6s)]
*  in the days ahead to try to get back to an agreement, to get back to a way to end the war. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=366.24s)]
*  And we're going to be talking with Prime Minister Netanyahu about the best way to do that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=371.44s)]
*  All right, State Department spokesman Matt Miller, thank you very much for updating us. We appreciate it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=375.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWu3-ailP4&t=401.44s)]
