# ‘This is not the end’: Conflict between Israel and Hamas remains an issue despite ceasefire
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8)
*  Let me bring in Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security advisor. You know a little bit about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=0.0s)]
*  negotiations. So I wonder how you read this. Should we not be surprised that there might be some [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=4.08s)]
*  last-minute wrangling given, as Raf just pointed out, the devilishly complex nature of everything [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=9.76s)]
*  that came before? Or do you sense a little nervousness, perhaps, with several items yet [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=15.44s)]
*  to be finalized, in the words of Bibi Netanyahu? Well, I think we should not be surprised. I mean, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=21.6s)]
*  part of what is so both simple and complicated about this, Chris, is that this is essentially [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=30.0s)]
*  the same deal that has been on the table since the spring. But there are these issues like the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=35.92s)]
*  Philadelphia corridor that have kind of constantly been the back and forth in the negotiation, as [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=42.0s)]
*  well as just the general willingness by both Hamas and the Israeli government to take the leap into [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=47.28s)]
*  an agreement. And so I think part of this is just the difficulty of nailing down the precise details [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=53.68s)]
*  of something like what an IDF military deployment might look like in the Philadelphia quarter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=60.72s)]
*  But also, Chris, and you've covered politics, part of this is the political posturing, frankly, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=65.84s)]
*  of how a deal is going to be framed. And I think for Netanyahu, he is trying to bring along [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=73.2s)]
*  people who are even further to his right in his coalition. And so therefore, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=80.8s)]
*  he's trying to signal in that statement. I mean, it's transparent. He wants it to appear that Hamas [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=84.96s)]
*  folded at the last minute on something as a means of kind of shoring up his political support for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=92.16s)]
*  this agreement. So I think it's a combination of nailing down the final details of some of the most [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=97.6s)]
*  contentious aspects of the agreement. But I think it's also the kind of preliminary framing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=104.32s)]
*  from both Hamas and certainly from what we heard in that statement from the Israeli government, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=110.8s)]
*  so that they're in a stronger position when they do go out to announce it to say that they extracted [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  concession at the end or that they prevailed in a negotiation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=122.72s)]
*  And so I think we're in that interim period where there's pretty much an agreement, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=126.8s)]
*  but parties are also trying to begin to frame how that agreement is announced and received publicly. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=132.16s)]
*  And I think that has to do with internal politics as well. But when you have this degree of momentum [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=138.64s)]
*  and this degree of assurance that an agreement is coming, it would be, to me, very surprising if [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=144.72s)]
*  somehow we don't hear that final announcement in the coming hours. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=152.32s)]
*  JUDY WOODRUFF. Joe Biden is expected to speak publicly soon. This is something that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=156.64s)]
*  was probably the biggest thing on his agenda that had not yet been resolved. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=161.12s)]
*  He's made no secret of the fact how hard he has had his team working on this and how much [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=166.16s)]
*  it has meant to him personally. What would you expect to hear from him? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=171.52s)]
*  JOHN YANG, President, National Council on Foreign Policy, Israel, and the Israeli Government [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=175.6s)]
*  Well, I think we heard a bit of a preview of how he kind of is framing the completion of his [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=178.8s)]
*  presidency in his foreign policy speech the other day, in which he obviously defended his [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  support for Israel throughout this process, while lamenting the suffering of the Palestinian people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=194.56s)]
*  I think this was obviously an extraordinarily painful period that is a definitional issue [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=202.0s)]
*  for President Biden and his legacy on foreign policy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=209.76s)]
*  I think you will hear him talk about how hard he and his team have worked to try to recover [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=213.76s)]
*  the hostages and try to bring about an end to the conflict. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=218.8s)]
*  Look, I think the reality also is that the timing is conspicuous. Donald Trump has made it known [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  since he was elected that he wanted this completed by the time he took office. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=230.08s)]
*  And Donald Trump has a lot of leverage right now as it relates to Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  in some ways precisely because they are more like-minded, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=241.84s)]
*  they are kind of more strongman types on the political right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=245.92s)]
*  And so I think we have to acknowledge that this is both the outcome of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=250.32s)]
*  negotiations not just by the United States, but by Qatar and Egypt and obviously Israel, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=255.44s)]
*  Hamas and others, but also this kind of convergence of the end of the Biden administration [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=260.88s)]
*  and the beginning of the Trump administration. The timing of both men, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=267.12s)]
*  had a lot of interest in this being done by January 20th. And I think it's that timing [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=273.44s)]
*  that seems to have pushed over the goal line. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=278.24s)]
*  And we did see that before we heard from Joe Biden, we got a statement taking credit from [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=279.76s)]
*  Donald Trump. Having said that, let me ask you the question that I asked Senator Coons, which is, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=286.08s)]
*  do you think that this bodes well potentially for what may happen going forward, at least the things [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=290.48s)]
*  inside of what we expect to be Marco Rubio's purview, he is expected to be confirmed [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=298.48s)]
*  as Secretary of State, the fact that the outgoing and incoming administration were able to work [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=304.0s)]
*  together to apparently get us to this point. We will see when somebody comes to the podium [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=309.92s)]
*  there in Doha. But what do you think it pretends? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=315.36s)]
*  You know, honestly, Chris, I don't want to overstate that. I mean, first of all, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=320.0s)]
*  Marco Rubio was always going to be the easiest confirmation of the national security appointments [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=324.96s)]
*  in terms of Democratic votes. But in terms of this issue, the reality is there's not a lot of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=329.68s)]
*  difference between the Biden administration and the Trump administration's approach to the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=336.96s)]
*  conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. I mean, that's part of the reason why I've been [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=341.44s)]
*  somewhat critical over the last several months. I think what is most important today is that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=347.36s)]
*  hostages hopefully are going to be released and reunited with their families and that the people [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=356.56s)]
*  of Gaza who've suffered hell on earth have the potential to get peace for a period, at least, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=361.36s)]
*  and assistance in. But going forward on the question of this conflict itself, this is not [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=368.48s)]
*  the end. Even if you get to that phase three, which is the ceasefire, there's still the question [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=375.6s)]
*  of the future of Gaza. Who's going to be administering Gaza? What's the future of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=380.88s)]
*  Palestinian governance in Gaza? What's the future of Hamas? The West Bank is very volatile. So this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=384.72s)]
*  does not end the conflict or the underlying conditions that brought about the conflict [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  in Gaza or the West Bank. That will continue to be a challenge for the Trump administration. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=396.8s)]
*  And then in terms of kind of bipartisanship, look, this issue has uniquely been a bipartisan one, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=401.28s)]
*  not just the last couple of months, but there's broad support for the Israeli government and the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=409.36s)]
*  U.S. Congress. And we've not seen that lead to bipartisan cooperation on other issues, Chris. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=415.84s)]
*  So I think we have to – this is the reality. This is an issue in which Joe Biden and Donald [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=424.24s)]
*  Trump don't have a lot to highlight between them. And if anything, I think Trump giving this a bit [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=429.92s)]
*  of a push because there was this convergence of interest in the timing of the Trump inauguration [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  as a time to get this done, yes, that was an interesting and successful, hopefully, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  coordination between them. But I don't think it augurs bipartisan cooperation on issues that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=447.92s)]
*  are not related to this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=454.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1jJBkHjfS8&t=459.92s)]
