# Ayman: The Pro-Palestinian free speech double standard
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ)
*  The academic year comes to a close. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Thousands of students across the country [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=2.2s)]
*  are gearing up for graduation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=4.0s)]
*  But at the University of Southern California's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=6.0s)]
*  commencement ceremony, one key event will be missing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=7.88s)]
*  On Monday, the university announced [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=11.8s)]
*  it had canceled plans for a graduation speech [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=13.72s)]
*  by this year's valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=16.4s)]
*  citing safety concerns. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=19.56s)]
*  Now Tabassum's selection immediately sparked controversy [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=21.52s)]
*  on campus with several pro-Israel groups [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=24.52s)]
*  demanding the university reconsider its decision, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=26.98s)]
*  citing pro-Palestinian social media posts from Tabassum, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=30.5s)]
*  who is Muslim, which they say were anti-Semitic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=33.74s)]
*  Now we should note Tabassum has said [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=37.38s)]
*  that she had not yet planned the substance of her remarks [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=38.78s)]
*  when USC pulled the plug. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=42.02s)]
*  She, along with other critics of the decision, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=44.46s)]
*  say they believe the school canceled the speech [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=46.54s)]
*  because of her public support for Palestinians. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  In a statement, university officials said [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  the decision had nothing to do with freedom of speech, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=54.13999999999999s)]
*  saying in part, quote, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=57.059999999999995s)]
*  there is no free speech entitlement [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  to speak at a commencement. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  The issue here is how best to maintain [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=62.419999999999995s)]
*  campus security and safety, period. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=64.74s)]
*  However, the university has not elaborated [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  on exactly what safety concerns motivated their decision. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=70.66s)]
*  For years, free speech on college campuses [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=74.69999999999999s)]
*  has been a favorite topic among conservatives [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=77.17999999999999s)]
*  who argue or accuse the higher education system [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=79.58s)]
*  of silencing anyone who doesn't agree with them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=83.2s)]
*  So surely those very same critics you would think [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=86.28s)]
*  who decry so-called cancel culture [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=89.88s)]
*  would now be outraged over Tabassum's apparent cancellation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=92.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=95.8s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=96.84s)]
*  So far there's been nothing but crickets [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  from the cancel culture crowd. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=99.64s)]
*  But this isn't the first time pro-Palestinian speech [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=101.76s)]
*  has been censored in recent months. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=104.36s)]
*  Both Texas Governor Greg Abbott [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=106.84s)]
*  and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=108.4s)]
*  have cracked down on pro-Palestinian student groups, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=109.72s)]
*  urging public universities in their states [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=112.4s)]
*  to revise free speech policies [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=114.48s)]
*  to specifically target these groups. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=117.04s)]
*  And this policing of language [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=119.84s)]
*  when it comes to Israel's conduct and its war in Gaza [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=121.28s)]
*  extends far beyond our universities. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=124.0s)]
*  According to a new report released by The Intercept, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=126.92s)]
*  The New York Times instructed its journalists [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=130.16s)]
*  to avoid certain words when covering the war. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=132.08s)]
*  All that guidance includes restricting the use of terms [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=135.08s)]
*  like genocide and ethnic cleansing, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  which do have specific legal meaning, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=139.52s)]
*  and the leaked memo also directs journalists [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  not to use the phrase refugee camps [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  to describe certain settlements inside of Gaza. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=147.56s)]
*  Now, despite the fact these areas are recognized [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=150.44000000000003s)]
*  by the United Nations as such as refugee camps [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=152.96s)]
*  and has thousands, if not hundreds of thousands [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  of registered refugees, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  The Times also cautions its staff [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=160.44000000000003s)]
*  from using words like slaughter and massacre, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  which they say, quote, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=165.36s)]
*  convey more emotion than information. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=166.44000000000003s)]
*  But as The Intercept notes, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  even reporting on the Gaza war, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=170.92s)]
*  such language has been used repeatedly [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=172.6s)]
*  to describe attacks against Israelis by Palestinians [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=175.12s)]
*  and almost never in the case of large scale killing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=178.28s)]
*  of Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli military. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=181.4s)]
*  These examples are part of a much larger pattern [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=185.0s)]
*  that has come into focus over the last few months. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=187.64s)]
*  The weaponization of language, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=190.44s)]
*  especially when it comes to language [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=192.28s)]
*  against the state of Israel [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=193.8s)]
*  or in support of the Palestinian people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=195.72s)]
*  Let's consider a phrase I'm sure you have heard a lot [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=198.68s)]
*  about by now, from the river to the sea, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=201.84s)]
*  Palestine will be free. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=204.44s)]
*  It's a phrase that Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=206.36s)]
*  the only Palestinian American member of Congress [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=208.24s)]
*  has described as a quote, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=210.32s)]
*  aspirational call for freedom, human rights [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=212.0s)]
*  and peaceful coexistence. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=214.16s)]
*  However, it appears representative Tlaib's own colleagues [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  don't agree. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=218.88s)]
*  On Tuesday, the House passed a resolution [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  condemning the phrase as anti-Semitic, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  arguing that it calls for the destruction [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=224.0s)]
*  of the state of Israel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  Now there's no denying America has an ugly history [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=228.12s)]
*  of anti-Semitism, a past that continues [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=230.52s)]
*  well into our present. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=233.16s)]
*  According to the Anti-Defamation League in 2023, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=235.0s)]
*  anti-Semitic incidents jumped 140% [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  compared to the previous year. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=240.6s)]
*  In fact, the ADL tracked more incidents in 2023 [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=242.68s)]
*  than in any of the previous three years combined. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  But upon closer inspection, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=250.16s)]
*  that data raises some serious questions. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=252.84s)]
*  Because in 2023, the ADL marked any rally or demonstration [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=255.44s)]
*  where protesters uttered the phrase from the river to the sea [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=260.16s)]
*  as an anti-Semitic incident, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=263.68s)]
*  a drastic change in its own criteria of years past. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=265.44s)]
*  Over the last few months, we have seen words or phrases [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=269.68s)]
*  that were not previously defined as anti-Semitic [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=272.24s)]
*  being recontextualized and in some cases redefined [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=274.96s)]
*  in front of our very own eyes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=278.8s)]
*  That's the cultural moment that we find ourselves in, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=280.4s)]
*  one where a star student's chance to speak in front of her peers [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=282.88s)]
*  has been ripped away as quickly as it was given to her. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=286.64s)]
*  So what message do we want to send to her [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  that in order to succeed, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  you must stay silent about your beliefs? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  Because the systemic silencing of one side of a debate [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  is not a hallmark of a healthy or vibrant democracy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=301.4s)]
*  Because in order to have a debate, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  have the free exchange of ideas, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=307.2s)]
*  we can't keep moving the goalposts, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=309.2s)]
*  deciding who can speak and who can't speak, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=311.8s)]
*  what causes do deserve a platform [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=314.68s)]
*  and which ones should be deplatformed [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=316.64s)]
*  or even what words we're allowed to use [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=318.96s)]
*  and which ones are off limits. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=321.52s)]
*  In order for speech to be truly free, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  it must apply to everyone, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=327.88s)]
*  regardless of whether or not you may agree with it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=329.48s)]
*  And the best 2024 election coverage. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwSrciXlJDQ&t=341.8s)]
