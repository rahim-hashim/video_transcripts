# Johnson and Republican senators criticize Biden's retaliatory response against Iranian proxies
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson and a number of Republican senators are already criticizing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=0.0s)]
*  the president's retaliation, saying that Mr. Biden waited too long to respond to the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=7.8s)]
*  deaths of the three U.S. service members in Jordan. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  The speaker is saying, quote, Unfortunately, the administration waited for a week and telegraphed [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  to the world, including to Iran, the nature of our response. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=19.44s)]
*  Joining us now is Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=23.2s)]
*  Peter, thank you so much for being on with us today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=26.8s)]
*  The president is under a lot of pressure, was under a lot of pressure to respond to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=30.28s)]
*  the killing of the three service members in Jordan. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=34.2s)]
*  And some Republicans, as you know, were calling for direct strikes against Iran territorially. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=36.8s)]
*  Do you think that the strikes so far and the promise of more will quiet the criticism? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=42.32s)]
*  No, I don't think it will quiet the criticism. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  I think that criticism is going to come no matter what. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  And it did take a number of days, and there were some frustration. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  I think that it did, that there wasn't a faster response. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=55.24s)]
*  We're in an age, of course, where we want instant action. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  And the idea is, the longer you wait, the more you give the other side a chance to harden [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=63.64s)]
*  their defenses, to escape into the ether and so forth. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=69.64s)]
*  But the administration says, look, they weren't delaying for any particular reason except [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=74.4s)]
*  for the weather. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=78.92s)]
*  The Joint Chief says that they took the most advantageous moment to strike when it suited [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  their military needs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=86.2s)]
*  And while they can obviously strike even in bad weather, they would prefer to strike when [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  it was clear, or they brought these B-2s all the way from Texas to do that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=93.04s)]
*  So it depends. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=97.04s)]
*  We haven't seen the end of these strikes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=99.0s)]
*  They made very clear last night was the beginning, not the end. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=101.04s)]
*  Presumably we'll get more over the weekend. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=103.92s)]
*  We'll see what kind of damage it has done. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=105.76s)]
*  It's obviously still early in that regard. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  We don't know yet the extent of it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  But it does seem pretty clear the president does not intend to strike inside Iran, that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  in his view is too far of the escalatory ladder, to use the phrase that they like to use. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=116.76s)]
*  They may do that at some point down the road, but they don't want to do it at this point. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=121.84s)]
*  You know, they had long used—I mean, for decades they used that original authorization [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=125.12s)]
*  of the use of force from the Iraq War as the legal justification for taking a lot of actions [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=129.84s)]
*  in the region. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=137.72s)]
*  That was finally withdrawn, and now you've got Ben Cardin, the chairman of the Foreign [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=138.84s)]
*  Relations Committee, complaining that there should have been congressional approval. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  At least he said that beforehand, for any Middle East strikes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  There apparently was notification, probably for the big eight, the leaders and top committee [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=150.96s)]
*  chairs. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that's an issue? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  There's always a war power's, you know, push and pull through between the congressional [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=159.52s)]
*  branch and the White House. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there is, obviously. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=168.84s)]
*  And that's natural. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=170.64s)]
*  We've divided war powers in our system, and the president has taken more and more of that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=172.0s)]
*  over the years. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=176.16s)]
*  But, you know, look, I don't know any president who wouldn't have gone ahead with a strike [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=177.16s)]
*  like this or, you know, waited for Congress. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=181.4s)]
*  The one time I saw a president do that was when President Obama waited to decide, for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=183.4s)]
*  Congress to decide, sorry, whether to take risals against Syria for a chemical weapons [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=188.48s)]
*  attack against its own citizens. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  And ultimately he didn't take that strike. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=194.12s)]
*  There was sort of reluctance in Congress to authorize it, but that wasn't against American [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=196.48s)]
*  troops. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=199.68s)]
*  In this case, it's a direct response to the killing of three American troops. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=200.68s)]
*  That's very traditionally within the commander-in-chief's ambit, at least as it's been practiced in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=204.44s)]
*  modern times. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=210.56s)]
*  So, yes, there'll be tension over that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=211.56s)]
*  There's tension over the provision of weapons, for instance, to Israel without more congressional [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=214.0s)]
*  oversight, since the administration has authorized certain weapons to be provided to Israel without [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=218.4s)]
*  waiting for Congress. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=225.32s)]
*  I think that's got some Democrats on the Hill frustrated as well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=226.32s)]
*  But broadly speaking, you know, the commander-in-chief has a lot of room to operate here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=229.72s)]
*  And of course, you referenced when President Obama did not take action when Syria crossed [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  the red line by using, you know, they used nerve gas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=242.64s)]
*  And that ended up, as you know, weakening the president's hand with a lot of our Arab [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=247.88s)]
*  allies. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=252.76s)]
*  It did. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a lasting issue. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  We hear that all the time from people in the Middle East about how Obama didn't follow [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=258.36s)]
*  through on the threat. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=262.36s)]
*  And I think that's why, of course, Biden understands that he was vice president at the time, and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=263.36s)]
*  he did follow through on his threat here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=267.84s)]
*  Now, again, we can argue about whether it's going to be enough or whether or not it will [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=269.88s)]
*  accomplish what he intends it to accomplish, but he didn't allow this strike to go unanswered. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=273.0s)]
*  The trick is, of course, you know, he doesn't want it to spiral into a broad full-fledged [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  war with Iran. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  Intelligence by the American side says that Iran doesn't want a full-fledged war either. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  But you can easily see how things can get out of hand. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=290.8s)]
*  At the same time, if you don't take a retaliation, like the strong enough officials reason, then [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=293.08s)]
*  all you're going to do is simply keep it going. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=299.64s)]
*  And these low-level attacks, we've already had 160 of them since October 7th, the vast [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  majority of them very unsuccessful. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=306.12s)]
*  But at some point, you get a lucky drone, get through lucky from the point of view of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=307.64s)]
*  the enemy, as it did on Sunday, and somebody gets killed. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXBbu7zZrc&t=312.24s)]
