# USC Valedictorian speaks out after University cancels graduation speech
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI)
*  But the double standard being applied to pro-Palestinian free speech, perhaps no one knows that better [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=0.0s)]
*  than the University of Southern California valedictorian Asna Tabassum, who was barred [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=5.14s)]
*  from speaking at this year's commencement ceremony after pro-Israel groups raised concerns [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=10.06s)]
*  over her social media posts in support of Palestinians. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=15.34s)]
*  Earlier, I had the chance to speak with Asna about the university's decision and her plans [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=18.66s)]
*  for the future. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=23.1s)]
*  Asna, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=24.1s)]
*  First off, tell us how you felt when you received the news from the university that they were [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=28.64s)]
*  canceling your speech over, quote, safety concerns. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=33.88s)]
*  And have they given you any reasons or details as to what those safety concerns were? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=37.72s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it was unexpected, for sure. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  I think I was a little bit disappointed in my university, especially because they've [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  had my back throughout all four years that I've been at USC. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  This was not the greatest feeling, for sure. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=56.32s)]
*  But I think what was the toughest part about it was that I received no details as to what [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=60.22s)]
*  the security concerns were. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=65.26s)]
*  And I care about safety. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=67.06s)]
*  And ultimately, if I were given concerns, I would have made the necessary steps. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=68.82s)]
*  But I wasn't given any reason to believe that security was the basis of the decision. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=72.7s)]
*  There were several pro-Israel groups who demanded the university rescind your selection due [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=79.14s)]
*  to pro-Palestinian social media posts. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=84.92s)]
*  Do you believe that was a factor in the decision by the university to not allow you to give [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=87.4s)]
*  this valedictorian speech? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=92.8s)]
*  Yeah, so I had some material on my Instagram that was pro-Palestinian, for sure. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=95.8s)]
*  And I think that that invited, unfortunately, a lot of hatred. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, some of it was like a valid academic position or ideological position. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=105.88s)]
*  But a lot of it was unfortunately just plain Islamophobia, plain racism. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=110.74000000000001s)]
*  And I think the pressure of that hatred campaign definitely played a role in the university's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=116.34s)]
*  decision. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=122.54s)]
*  And I'm sure multiple factors were at play. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=123.54s)]
*  But I would say that that's possibly one of the biggest ones. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=127.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=129.86s)]
*  I'm sure you probably saw this on Friday. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=130.86s)]
*  This situation continues to just kind of spiral out of control. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=132.62s)]
*  You had the USC announcing that it would eliminate all outside speakers, including John Hsu, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=136.02s)]
*  who is the director of Crazy Rich Asians, tennis star Billie Jean King, from attending [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=143.12s)]
*  the ceremony, citing the quote, highly publicized circumstances now surrounding the event. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=147.56s)]
*  First of all, what is your reaction to that and how quickly this situation is spiraling [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  and getting bigger? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=158.72s)]
*  Do you think this could have been a preemptive move in case one of the invited speakers either [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=159.72s)]
*  chose not to show up or perhaps express solidarity with you or to try to dilute the fact that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=164.94s)]
*  this is about you and more about public safety? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  I think that's definitely a possibility. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  I have no idea personally. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=177.76s)]
*  But what I will say is that I was at a dinner when I got the news and I got many, many texts. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=180.4s)]
*  And I think my first reaction, my first feeling was, you know, an ultimate hurt because my [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=185.22s)]
*  class has worked so hard for graduation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=192.34s)]
*  And I know that we deserve a commencement that is true to the work that we've put in. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=195.28s)]
*  And I think it's also just it's a tough factor to know that, you know, we are most of us [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  are from the high school class of 2020. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=204.42s)]
*  We didn't receive our high school graduation either. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=206.88s)]
*  And so for this to also be, you know, the not traditional commencement that we've been [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=209.18s)]
*  looking forward to and for some of us, it's like one of the biggest moments of our lives. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=213.62s)]
*  It's honestly so tough. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=219.14s)]
*  And I think that everyone's on the same page here about wanting to celebrate and wanting [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=221.24s)]
*  to have fun for the work that we've done so hard. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=226.12s)]
*  So yeah, it's it's definitely tough. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=229.88s)]
*  I'm sure you've been aware and certainly for years, you know, there's been a debate in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=232.12s)]
*  this country and certainly those on the right in this country have complained about attacks [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=235.72s)]
*  on free speech on college campuses. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=239.96s)]
*  They claim that it stifles the free exchange of ideas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=242.76s)]
*  I'm curious, have you received any support from that cancel culture crowd or do there [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=246.12s)]
*  free speech protection seems to have ideological limitations when it comes to people speaking [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=251.04s)]
*  up on behalf of Palestinians? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, I've honestly seen both. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=259.98s)]
*  I think there are people who might not agree with my views, who are still fighting for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=262.26s)]
*  my privilege to speak. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=266.34s)]
*  There are also people who don't agree with my views, who, you know, don't want me to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=268.18s)]
*  speak. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=272.14s)]
*  And so there's there's definitely not a homogenous like set of set of people here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=273.14s)]
*  And I think that there's people with wildly different perspectives who have wildly different [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=279.28s)]
*  reactions to the issue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=282.76s)]
*  What I will say, though, is that for me, I see free speech and academic discourse as [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=284.64s)]
*  integral to the university culture. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=289.06s)]
*  And I think that it's very important that we remain consistent with the way that we [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=291.7s)]
*  apply free speech and encourage free speech. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=295.28s)]
*  And there shouldn't be, for example, double standards or inconsistencies with how we apply [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=298.12s)]
*  this freedom and this right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=303.68s)]
*  Do you think there is currently a double standard and inconsistent with what you're seeing both [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=305.38s)]
*  in your own personal example and across colleges in America, for example, what is happening [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=309.54s)]
*  in Columbia University and elsewhere in this country against those who want to speak up [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=314.46s)]
*  on behalf of Palestinians? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=319.5s)]
*  To be honest, yes, I think that unfortunately it takes a it's a little bit of inconsistency [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=322.7s)]
*  when it comes to applying free speech. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=329.06s)]
*  And I think that everybody should be welcome to put their views on the table. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=330.82s)]
*  That's exactly what academic discourse is. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=335.04s)]
*  You know, and student activism is as American as apple pie, you know, and that's where we [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  should be most available and most free to make our opinions known, most available to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=342.52s)]
*  protest. And my brothers and sisters in Columbia, at Pitzer, at Berkeley, you know, like we're [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=348.04s)]
*  making change. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=354.6s)]
*  We're using our voices and we're amplifying one another. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=355.8s)]
*  And if we're not doing it on college campuses where discourse is supposed to be encouraged, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=359.36s)]
*  then where can we do it? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=364.6s)]
*  And so free speech must be applied consistently. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=366.06s)]
*  And it's most important and it has the most gravity on college campuses, for sure. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=370.14000000000004s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what you want to see happen next. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=375.74s)]
*  I mean, are you individually going to seek any kind of recourse against your rights within [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=377.86s)]
*  the university, silencing your speech or canceling your speech? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=383.66s)]
*  Are you going to pursue that? And more importantly, what do you plan on doing next with both this [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=387.14000000000004s)]
*  attention you got and the momentum that you have behind you for for your speech? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=392.06s)]
*  Are you going to deliver the speech somewhere else that we can hear? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=396.16s)]
*  What were you going to say? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=398.6s)]
*  So my priority here is to make sure that what has happened to me does not happen to anyone [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=401.32s)]
*  else. You know, and I think that my duty here and my principle here is to make sure that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=405.8s)]
*  students who come in the future feel encouraged and feel free to express their views no [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=411.12s)]
*  matter what those views may be. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=416.52s)]
*  And I think that I'm keeping my options open about how to best set that precedent. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=418.53999999999996s)]
*  But ultimately, I love my university. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, my university has given me everything. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=425.58s)]
*  It's also given me the very education that I'm using to make my voice heard in the world [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=427.78s)]
*  right now. And so it's it's something that I'm thinking about. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=432.5s)]
*  But when it comes to like, I'm sorry, can you repeat the second part of your question? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=435.9s)]
*  The second part is more or less what are you going to do now? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=441.18s)]
*  I mean, you know, you won't be able to address your classmates at your commencement. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  Is there a message that you'd like to share with them or any other soon to be graduate at [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  this moment? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=453.8s)]
*  Yeah, my message to the graduates right now is we've been given such a wonderful [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=456.20000000000005s)]
*  education. We've learned how to learn. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=461.52000000000004s)]
*  And it's upon us. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  It's the responsibility upon us to learn about the world and make decisions and make [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=466.68s)]
*  change. And if we're not using our education in this way, then we're not doing due [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=473.72s)]
*  respect to the education that not a lot of people in this world receive when it comes to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0R5NSCGItI&t=479.02000000000004s)]
