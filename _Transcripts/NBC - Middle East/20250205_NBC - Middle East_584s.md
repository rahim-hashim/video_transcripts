# Rep. Mike Turner voices ‘great concerns’ over Trump’s Gaza proposal
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos)
*  Joining me now is Republican Congressman Mike Turner. He's a member of the Armed Services Committee. He's the former chair of the Intelligence Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=0.0s)]
*  First of all, are you concerned about the president's comments on Gaza? They certainly were not off the cuff [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=7.72s)]
*  They were planned he was reading and he said he'd been working on it for months [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=12.6s)]
*  But there is furious reaction from the Arab world from our closest allies [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=16.76s)]
*  Andrew, thank you for having me [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=20.84s)]
*  You know your your poor killer, Donald and even Mike Allen both, you know characterized it as [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=22.88s)]
*  You know, perhaps it's provocative. It's early disruptive [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=29.16s)]
*  I think it certainly characterizes that you know, it challenges the region to begin to have a discussion as well [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=31.8s)]
*  What's what's their plan? What's going to happen as you know as a result of the tragedy of October 7th? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=37.84s)]
*  The you know, we're currently in a situation of a ceasefire [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=42.96s)]
*  the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=47.04s)]
*  Palestinians are living in desperate situation in in Gaza [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, certainly there's there's very little that the president can do [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=52.68s)]
*  Unilaterally here and I think there would be a very little support in Congress for the United States to take over Gaza [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  but but certainly the president in his style in his way and I don't intend to be a Trump translator but in his style in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  his way certainly has has caused a a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=68.76s)]
*  Focus of the world to turn to okay. So what is going to be the solution for Gaza and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=73.44s)]
*  And certainly everyone is focusing on his his suggestion and then what will be? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  What do we turn to next and there were there have been months and months of talks with the UAE with MBS himself [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=84.46s)]
*  certainly with [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=91.98s)]
*  You know Sheikh Mohammed in the cutter who has been such a key intermediary with Hamas throughout all of this that they would [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=93.22s)]
*  Participate in rebuilding Gaza if they were a pathway to a Palestinian state [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=100.78s)]
*  so is is that goal which is a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=105.5s)]
*  great goal of Netanyahu also because Saudi normalization is at stake and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=109.02s)]
*  that indirect conflict with the Israeli the pressure from [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=114.14s)]
*  Certainly two ministers and part in a key parts of the coalition to do exactly the opposite [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  to take more land from the West Bank and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=125.7s)]
*  You potentially take land in Gaza [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=129.34s)]
*  Well, I think what's essential here is that the plan has to have the security of Israel and what we've seen with the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=140.9s)]
*  Hamas having been [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=142.94s)]
*  Substantially diminished with Hezbollah having been substantially diminished with Iran now currently [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=144.82s)]
*  significantly [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=151.82s)]
*  reeling from the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=153.26s)]
*  The back-and-forth that they've had where they expected to be coming out on top [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=155.74s)]
*  You do see an opportunity in the region where we can [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=159.74s)]
*  Hopefully through negotiations as the president has indicated that even he's willing to talk to Iran the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=164.22s)]
*  To look at well what can be solutions in the area they can guarantee Israel's security there have to be long-term [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=171.1s)]
*  Solutions and it has to be [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=178.14s)]
*  The core of it has to be central to Israel's security now acknowledging that the president is a negotiator and he [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=180.34s)]
*  Often opens with the maximum [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=188.06s)]
*  Deal and then works backward [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  But this is what Jared Kushner had to say his son-in-law who was [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=192.26s)]
*  Really the point person for a lot of Middle Eastern Persian Gulf diplomacy when he was in the White House [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=196.58s)]
*  That's what he had to say at Harvard just last year last year in February [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=201.06s)]
*  I think that both sides are spending a fortune on military. I think neither side [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=206.5s)]
*  Really wants to have you know a terrorist organization on clave right between them and Gaza's waterfront property. It could be very valuable [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=210.42s)]
*  He was talking about a real estate deal [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=218.78s)]
*  Well, I think though what was more critical about what he said was that these are terrorist groups and organizations [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=220.5s)]
*  I wouldn't focus on the words waterfront property [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=226.38s)]
*  I focus on the words terrorist groups and organizations from us terrorist group an organization [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=228.74s)]
*  Hezbollah terrorist groups organizations satellite franchise organizations groups of Iran. I mean this has [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=233.54s)]
*  The only way that that Israel can have long-term [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=240.42s)]
*  Security and safety and really the only way that the Palestinians can ever have true autonomy [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=245.02s)]
*  Sovereignty and security themselves is that they be free from the satellite [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=251.18s)]
*  Terrorist groups and organizations of Iran and that hopefully can be the way forward [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=256.26s)]
*  Israel has really accomplished a transformation of the region the air defenses because of their retaliation against Iran been you know vastly reduced [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=262.74s)]
*  Syria's thought is gone. Hezbollah is gone the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas have been targeted assassinations [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  There's a ceasefire in Lebanon. There's some good leaders now in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=278.74s)]
*  Comparison to the US diplomacy. We're you know standing up in Lebanon so far [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=283.1s)]
*  But what would you think about us boots on the ground in Gaza? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=289.7s)]
*  Well, I think it'd be I mean there would be grave concerns [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=293.22s)]
*  I think in Congress and certainly I would have great concerns also [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  But the other aspect that there's this one more step that that on your list there that we need to throw in there [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=299.38s)]
*  And that is Iran must not become a nuclear weapons state and their ability to complete that has got to be significant [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  diminished and do you think that they are trying to find a shortcut to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=312.58000000000004s)]
*  Shorten the time where they could have something like a rough bomb [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=317.94s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely and and what has been allowed in the last administration for them to continue to enrich [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=321.3s)]
*  And gain capabilities has got to be has got to be reversed [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=328.38s)]
*  well partly because some would say because of the withdrawal from the nuclear deal, but and also some neglect and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=333.06s)]
*  Let me you know just also ask you about the CIA I think back to the tragedy in Beirut in the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=340.3s)]
*  1983 we lost an entire [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=347.42s)]
*  Generation of our Middle East CIA operatives in that horrible bombing at the embassy and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=350.62s)]
*  Now we're talking about buyouts [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=358.42s)]
*  the entire workforce [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=361.26s)]
*  You know how long it takes to train? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=363.3s)]
*  An operative to be able to go overseas and then develop sources and contacts and the analysts [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=366.46s)]
*  Just to get clearances to recruit recruitment's been up [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  Well would not be the entire workforce eligibility remember andrew is not like the entire workforce walking [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  It was it was offered to the entire workforce eligibility is not the entire workforce walking out the door [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=383.74s)]
*  Yeah, as we go through these budgetary changes [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  But also as we go through this issue of making certain that we have agencies [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=391.82s)]
*  departments [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=397.74s)]
*  Bureaucracies that are responsive to policy leaderships of groups and organizations in the federal government [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  It's really important to better make these transitions and I think the CIA and I think director Radcliffe is making the right decisions [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  He's a great leader. He understands certainly what the CIA needs to do. He's been he's led [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=412.24s)]
*  What about his deputy Mike Ellis? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=417.5s)]
*  I think Mike Ellis is going to be listening directly to the director who is a great great leader [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=420.06s)]
*  And I think you're going to see excellent national security policy come out of the CIA [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=425.46s)]
*  And do you think that at this stage with our national security and our counterterror issues having withdrawn from? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=429.42s)]
*  Afghanistan and not having eyes on there with Isis potentially resurgent with Hamas fighters [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=436.5s)]
*  Reappearing in Gaza, is this the time to lose anybody from the CIA? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=443.7s)]
*  There are terrible dangers around the world [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=447.86s)]
*  But at the same time I do think that and again, we're not talking about overall in reducing our our intelligence [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=449.82s)]
*  capabilities [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=458.22s)]
*  Or our investments in intelligence [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=459.3s)]
*  Operations [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=463.1s)]
*  There are opportunities for us to redirect to reinvest to invest in different ways [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=464.54s)]
*  And I think giving the director that ability that that option is certainly important and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=469.18s)]
*  What about Chelsea Gabbard as DNI? I know the Senate confirms not the house [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=475.18s)]
*  But few people know as much about intelligence as you do [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=480.7s)]
*  CIA is operational DNI is [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  organizational, but they [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=487.86s)]
*  the different director of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=489.46000000000004s)]
*  National intelligence has the final cut on the presidential daily brief in particular [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=491.5s)]
*  I was a little concerned about that nomination [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=497.18s)]
*  I've the it's been interesting to watch that the Senate confirmation process and how senators have have found their way in [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=499.62s)]
*  Support of her nomination and those Republican senators [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=507.3s)]
*  But what about the fact that she still refuses to say that? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=510.09999999999997s)]
*  Ebert Snowden is a terrorist and and let me be clear. She's a convert on FISA [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=512.78s)]
*  Which is absolutely a traitor and those of us who are in intelligence and know exactly what he did and what he took and even [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=517.3s)]
*  Those I think of the information that's in the public. It's very clear. He was a traitor to his country [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=524.46s)]
*  There's a reason why he's in asylum in Russia [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=529.82s)]
*  and it's unfortunate that she [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=533.86s)]
*  Fails to make that statement because it's one that that should be easy and obvious to state [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=535.98s)]
*  Could we find better people than Tulsi Gabbard to take over? There's always someone better than someone else, right? But I think [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=540.1800000000001s)]
*  You know [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=546.1800000000001s)]
*  We need people who are committed to our country and apparently that the senators as they're going through the process are convinced that she is [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=546.7800000000001s)]
*  Do you think the speaker supports intelligence there's no one more experienced than you and you're not on the committee anymore [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=551.86s)]
*  That's very kind of you Andrew. I appreciate it. I think I think the speaker at his heart is very very committed to national security [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=558.1800000000001s)]
*  You [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leawi-qHBos&t=581.82s)]
