# U.S. military has shot down some Iranian drones targeting Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go)
*  Joining us now is NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=0.0s)]
*  Richard, what are you seeing now? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=3.2s)]
*  So things have been developing here in Jerusalem, Andrew, over the last few minutes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=7.44s)]
*  It just stopped a moment ago, but I have a feeling it will start up again [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  any second or in the next few minutes. So I am in Jerusalem. Behind me here is the old city. You [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=16.32s)]
*  can make out the old city walls. And a short while ago, we heard the air raid siren warning [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=22.16s)]
*  people to get off the streets. And now there are very few people still out on the streets. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=29.2s)]
*  But what we saw here, which I have not seen here before, was an enormous amount of tracer fire, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=34.16s)]
*  rocket fire in the skies. They seemed like they were part of the air defense system, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=42.8s)]
*  not the Iranian drones. They were coming from in and around this city, but firing up in that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=48.4s)]
*  direction. And if we stay together for a little bit longer, I think you will see more of it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=54.64s)]
*  At one stage, just in this sky behind me, you can see a little bit of it. You see an orange dot [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=59.28s)]
*  up high that is moving. I don't know if you can see that ball. Sometimes those there just exploded. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=65.84s)]
*  I don't know if you were able to see that. Yes, we can. We can see it, Richard. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=72.56s)]
*  Before, there must have been 50, 60 or 70 of those streaking across the sky here behind me [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=75.68s)]
*  as we heard the air raid siren. So clearly there was a perceived threat. The systems went off. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=84.56s)]
*  The alert system went off. And then these flares, these rockets, which have the ability to explode to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=91.2s)]
*  potentially interrupt the intercept, these drones were deployed in very large numbers. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=97.92000000000002s)]
*  There's one streaking across the sky right now that I think you can see almost like an orange [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=102.8s)]
*  shooting star. Exactly. A few more up above it. And now one coming in the opposite direction. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=108.08s)]
*  And this has been going on for about just about the last 20 minutes or so, which is right around [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=118.08s)]
*  the time that Israeli officials predicted that the Iranian drones would start entering into [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Israeli airspace. So we're going to keep following this and see what happens as this very unique [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=132.08s)]
*  air war that was just an explosion there is happening over the over the old city in Jerusalem. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  Richard, to see this happening over the old city is remarkable because usually, well, specifically [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=146.24s)]
*  in this instance, we were told that they did not expect this to be going near targeting civilian [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  areas. There could not be anything more dense than the old city. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=158.0s)]
*  No doubt. And the Iranians have described this operation as taking place in three phases. The [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=165.6s)]
*  first phase, all now, all over the next several hours. The first phase with drones, with a massive [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=171.12s)]
*  launch of drones from Iran. Second phase with drones being launched from Iraq and Syria, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=179.76s)]
*  also toward Israel. And the third phase, a ballistic missile phase. We have gotten a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=185.68s)]
*  confirmation from the Israeli military that some missiles have been fired toward Israel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  No exact confirmation of the type. But would they be, will they be launched at Jerusalem? Are they [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=196.88s)]
*  being launched at populated centers? Clearly, the air raid systems here have detected a threat. The [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=203.28s)]
*  sirens went off and now we'll see if it continues. But for about 20 minutes, 30 minutes, we had a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=209.92s)]
*  very intense scene with the defense systems trying to protect the skies over this ancient and holy [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=217.2s)]
*  city. And we have more reporting from Courtney Kubi I wanted to share with you, Richard, which is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  that the U.S. military intends to shoot down these drones and missiles, whatever they can, when they [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=231.6s)]
*  come into range of any U.S. assets in Iraq, Syria and at sea. The U.S. has, as you know, beefed up [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=236.96s)]
*  its air defenses in recent months since the attack on Tower 22. They have repositioned assets in the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=243.12s)]
*  region to be ready for this Iranian attack. You know, the CENTCOM commander has been there in [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=248.0s)]
*  Israel and in the region as well coordinating. And they have already shot down some Iranian drones [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=252.32s)]
*  tonight, according to U.S. officials. We're trying to get more details. So we don't know what you [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=258.32s)]
*  were seeing and what you shared with us, but this could be part of it. No, what I believe what we [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=264.48s)]
*  were seeing here was part of the Israeli air defense systems, but a different kind of defense [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=270.24s)]
*  system. Maybe it was coordinated with the United States. Now, for the last six months, almost [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=277.04s)]
*  everything has been coordinated. But these are not the items, the drones coming from Iran, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=282.16s)]
*  because you just sell in the direction. If I ask, if we turn around, you can see [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=288.0s)]
*  coming, that's the opposite direction. That's heading toward Tehran. So just to sort of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=293.92s)]
*  accent, orient us ourselves on a map here. Behind the old city is Jordan and Iran is in that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=300.4s)]
*  direction. So if we're seeing some of these rockets coming from and the West Bank. So behind the old [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=306.8s)]
*  city, drop down into the Jordan Valley. You go throughout the West Bank. You go across the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=311.92s)]
*  Jordan River to the Dead Sea into Jordan. Jordan also says that it is using its air defenses. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=316.64s)]
*  Jordan is also a close, very close U.S. ally to shoot down drones flying over its territory or [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  Iranian missiles going through its airspace. Jordan is one of the several countries in this region [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=329.44s)]
*  tonight closing their airspace. Richard, take a step back and let's talk about how the region [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=335.28s)]
*  is going to respond because there has been so much anger at Israel from its neighbors [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=342.0s)]
*  because of the way it has conducted the war in Gaza and at the world, frankly, because of the siege [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=348.24s)]
*  and the deaths of Palestinian civilians. We've all experienced it. We've talked to the leaders. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=353.36s)]
*  I've traveled the region. You've traveled the region. Will this change that calculus as clearly [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  the White House is pivoting towards its ironclad defense of Israel under attack from Iran? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=365.36s)]
*  Richard Blankman, Director of the Israeli Defense Council for the United States of America [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=371.92s)]
*  Across the region, there is the Middle East, the Arab world, the broader Islamic world. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=375.12s)]
*  There is a very different conversation being had than the one in Washington, than many of the ones [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=380.16s)]
*  in the United States. There's a tremendous amount of anger against Israel. There's a tremendous [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=385.76s)]
*  amount of sympathy for the Palestinian people, not necessarily Hamas, but the Houthi attacks. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  When the Houthis have been carrying out their attacks on Israeli shipping or on the Red Sea, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=397.04s)]
*  they've generally been celebrated for that on the street, even though they've been attacked. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  In Iran, it seems like it didn't want to lose this moment. It felt that it needed to respond to an [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  attack on its embassy compound in Damascus, and it felt it was the right time because it has a bit [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=413.68s)]
*  of momentum. Now, that could prove to be a terrible disaster. Iran could be walking into a trap and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=421.6s)]
*  walking into an escalating war with the United States and Israel that is beyond anything that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=429.68s)]
*  it can handle. But the mood on the streets right now is another one, again, that's heading in the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=436.72s)]
*  direction of Iran, not coming from Iran, not close to Iran, but heading in that general direction. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=444.96s)]
*  So that's why it's pretty clear that these are being launched domestically, not incoming fire. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=452.79999999999995s)]
*  But the mood is very much against Israel on the popular street right now. So I think Iran, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  by doing this slow motion attack that is very visible, potentially not causing many casualties, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=466.96s)]
*  although it's still early hours here, it could have a symbolic effect. And there was a statement [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=474.96s)]
*  from the Iranian mission on its official X account saying that after this, Iran can consider this [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  issue closed, except, however, if Israel escalates it further. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=489.76s)]
*  Yeah, it was interesting that they came out and said, this is it for us, we can consider this [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=495.28s)]
*  closed, but if Israel makes, I believe the word it was, another mistake, our response will be more [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=500.4s)]
*  severe, something along those lines. And so Iran is clearly projecting it wants this to be the end [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=505.76s)]
*  of it, but that doesn't mean that this will be the end of it. If some of these ballistic missiles come [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=513.68s)]
*  and cause large numbers of casualties, Israel could easily respond in kind, and we could be in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=518.48s)]
*  a very different situation in the next couple of days. But if this slow rolled out, that is, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  at this stage, causing a lot of drama, but not much casualties, drama which will be seen all around [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=531.84s)]
*  the Arab and Islamic world, which will probably make Iran look strong, like it carried out its [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=539.12s)]
*  promises. It could be that Iran feels that it's accomplished its mission with just what it's doing [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=546.0s)]
*  right now, but we will see. And we only have less than a minute left, but then it depends on how [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=554.4s)]
*  Israel responds in any case, because Israel very much felt after the attack, the hideous attack on [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=562.0s)]
*  October 7th, that they had to prove their strength and reassert their strength and the fact that they [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=569.04s)]
*  were the invulnerable Israeli army. And so now you're into another whole other psycho drama. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=575.52s)]
*  That's why you've been doing this for so many years. It's all about perception and all about [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=580.4s)]
*  deterrence. Israel was badly, badly wounded, embarrassed. It felt that its capabilities [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  were, it didn't live up to its capabilities. Its reputation was damaged after October 7th [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=591.52s)]
*  and had to prove its deterrent. Now Iran was humiliated after its embassy compound was attacked [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=596.96s)]
*  in Damascus. Now it has to prove its capacity with drones and ballistic missiles, but will it go [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=603.2s)]
*  beyond this? We're going to have to leave it there. We will see probably in the next daylight hour, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=608.96s)]
*  when the daylights come. All right. Thank you so much Richard Angle. That does it for us for our [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX5xEAI4Go&t=613.36s)]
