# Why the U.S. is attacking sites in Yemen
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y)
*  A U.S.-led coalition conducted strikes on at least three dozen targets in Yemen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=0.0s)]
*  The attacks hit sites under the control of Iran-backed Houthi rebels. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=4.88s)]
*  The Pentagon says the Houthis will face further consequences if they continue to interfere [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=9.46s)]
*  with international trade in the Red Sea. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  A spokesman for the Houthis told NBC, quote, the American aggression on Yemen will not [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=16.22s)]
*  affect us, and they will see that our military operations will increase instead of being [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=20.98s)]
*  stopped. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=26.62s)]
*  Joining me now, former CIA Director John Brennan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=27.78s)]
*  He's an MSNBC senior national security and intelligence analyst and author of Undaunted, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=30.36s)]
*  My Fight Against America's Enemies at Home and Abroad. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  Director Brennan, thank you very much for being here this evening. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  So tell us, why are the Houthis intent on attacking ships in the Red Sea? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Is it solely to disrupt international trade? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=48.68s)]
*  Well, I think, Jonathan, it's a demonstration of solidarity with the Palestinian people [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  and with Hamas. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=56.9s)]
*  And as the fighting continues to go on in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis are going to continue [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=58.46s)]
*  to carry out these strikes against international shipping as a demonstration of their ability [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=63.22s)]
*  to lash back at those that are supporting Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  And attacks against U.S. naval vessels, as well as others in the Red Sea, allows them [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=72.66s)]
*  to do that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=77.58s)]
*  The Houthis control basically all of the western and northern parts of Yemen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=78.58s)]
*  And so they own basically the Yemeni coast along the Red Sea. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=82.46s)]
*  And they have formidable capabilities that they can use to lash out. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=86.92s)]
*  So again, I think what prompted this latest round of attacks against shipping is a result [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=90.2s)]
*  of what is going on in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=95.72s)]
*  So they say they're prepared for a long-term conflict with the United States. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=99.28s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=103.64s)]
*  Well, again, they have significant capabilities that have been enabled by Iranian support [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=105.44s)]
*  over the last several decades. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  The Houthis is a tribe in north of Yemen, but they've been able to take over much of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  Yemen as a result of internal strife there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=117.98s)]
*  And so they are able to continue to carry out these attacks. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  They were involved in basically a war with Saudi Arabia for a couple of years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  And so I think, again, they're trying to demonstrate that they are not going to be cowed by U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=129.18s)]
*  military action. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  But I must say that the number of strikes that are taking place and the size of the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  munitions being used hopefully will degrade their ability to carry out these attacks against [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=139.08s)]
*  civilian shipping, merchant shipping in the Red Sea. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=143.76s)]
*  Might other Iran-backed militia groups be drawn into this fight? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=147.4s)]
*  Well, I think they already are throughout the region, which is one of the challenges [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=153.32s)]
*  the United States faces. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=156.68s)]
*  What's going on in Syria, Iraq against our forces in Jordan and other areas, I think, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=158.04s)]
*  is Iran trying to show that it has the ability to disrupt activities in the region by using [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=163.18s)]
*  these proxy forces that they have supplied and funded over the past many years. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  They provided munitions, weapons, training, intelligence to these groups, and they can [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=174.54s)]
*  direct them as they see fit. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=180.66s)]
*  And some of these groups, which have localized agendas, though, will listen very carefully [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  to Iran. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=187.3s)]
*  In light of the continued conflict in Gaza, and Iran is a very strong supporter of Hamas [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=188.72s)]
*  as well, they have funded and supported Hamas for many years. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=194.44s)]
*  Again, I think this is Iran's way of showing that it can, in fact, push back against the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=197.8s)]
*  United States using these proxy forces. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=202.8s)]
*  You know, I asked this question of Congressman Clyburn in the last block. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=207.24s)]
*  I asked this question of you, too, as well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=210.52s)]
*  Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska, Republican of Nebraska, was on with Ali Velshi in the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=213.61999999999998s)]
*  last hour, and he said that the United States, the administration, should bring the fight [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=218.42s)]
*  to Tehran in retaliation for all of these things, for all of its sponsorship of terror [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=224.82s)]
*  in the region. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=231.26s)]
*  Would that be the proper response for the United States? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=232.42s)]
*  I do not believe so. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  I heard that interview with Representative Bacon, and maybe he was just using some catharsis [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=236.01999999999998s)]
*  here because Iran clearly has been responsible for a lot of blood shed, including of American [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=240.72s)]
*  blood over the past number of years. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=246.6s)]
*  But what are we hoping to accomplish with an attack on Iran? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=249.32s)]
*  Because it would open up a major, major war. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=252.4s)]
*  Look what happened when we went into Iraq, when we went into Afghanistan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=255.48s)]
*  I do not believe we want to engage in a major conflict with Iran, a country of 90 million [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=259.32s)]
*  people. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  What are we hoping to accomplish there? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  If anything that's going to bring the Iranian people together is if the United States attacks [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=266.76s)]
*  Iran. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=270.52s)]
*  That's why I think we can clearly send a message to Iran by attacking its forces, its special [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=271.52s)]
*  forces that are embedded with a lot of these proxy forces and militias throughout the region. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  I would argue against any type of direct confrontation with Iran absent some type of direct Iranian [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  attack against U.S. interests. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=287.06s)]
*  But I don't believe that there is a lot of support for Representative Bacon's position. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=289.2s)]
*  Director Brennan, U.S. officials say these strikes are not retaliation for the American [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=295.38s)]
*  deaths in Jordan. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=300.82s)]
*  But I'm just wondering, is this a distinction without a difference? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=301.97999999999996s)]
*  We've heard reporting from Keir Simmons, who made that point, and also Admiral Stavridis [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=305.34s)]
*  made that point in the last block. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think what the Houthis have been doing against shipping in the Red Sea has been taking [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  place for quite some time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  And we have taken strikes against the Houthis prior to the death of our three servicemen, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  service people in Jordan and the injury of over 50 others. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=325.94s)]
*  So this has its own sort of rationale as far as what we're trying to do with the Houthis. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=330.52s)]
*  But what the administration, the Biden administration right now is trying to do is to pursue multiple [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=335.5s)]
*  objectives simultaneously in the complex region of the Middle East, which is to try to keep [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=339.62s)]
*  our forces safe wherever they are in the Middle East, which requires the depriving of these [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=345.06s)]
*  Muslim groups the ability to carry out these lethal attacks. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=349.94s)]
*  It is to help protect international shipping in the Persian Gulf and through the Bab al-Mandab, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=353.02s)]
*  where a lot of international shipping goes through. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=358.1s)]
*  It is an effort to try to bring a ceasefire in Gaza and a release of the Israeli hostages [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=360.54s)]
*  there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=366.06s)]
*  Keep pushing for the advancement of a two-state solution in Palestine and Israel. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=367.06s)]
*  Keep alive the prospect of an establishment of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  There are multiple objectives here to include not having a broader war in the Middle East [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=377.32s)]
*  and engaging in direct confrontation with Iran, which is one of the challenges the Biden [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  administration has. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=386.92s)]
*  But also, I think it is having a very, I think a very effective strategy here of this delicate [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=388.42s)]
*  balancing among all of these different objectives in a way that addresses the threats that we [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=394.62s)]
*  face, but at the same time not doing something reckless that is just going to further engulf [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=400.28s)]
*  this region in violence and flames. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOCJv1l59Y&t=405.24s)]
