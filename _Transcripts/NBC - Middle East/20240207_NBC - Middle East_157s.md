# Secy. Blinken says toll of Israel's military action is 'too high' in Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs)
*  We have pressed Israel in concrete ways to strengthen civilian protection, to get more assistance to those who need it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=0.0s)]
*  And over the past four months, Israel has taken important steps to do just that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=9.0s)]
*  Starting the flow of aid, doubling it during the first pause for hostage releases, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=13.0s)]
*  opening the north and south corridors in Gaza so that people could move out of immediate harms way, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=19.0s)]
*  through these corridors with four hours pause every day, three hours notice, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=25.0s)]
*  opening Kerem Shalom, starting the flow of assistance from Jordan, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=30.0s)]
*  establishing de-confliction mechanisms for humanitarian sites. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=35.0s)]
*  As a result, today, more assistance than ever is moving into Gaza from more places than at any time since October 7th. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=40.0s)]
*  As the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=49.0s)]
*  the United States has helped provide much of that assistance, including funding 90,000 metric tons of flour delivered from Ashdod Port. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=53.0s)]
*  That's enough to provide bread for 1.4 million people for the next five months. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=62.0s)]
*  A UN team began its mission to the north to assess conditions for the civilians who are still there, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=67.0s)]
*  as well as what needs to be done to allow displaced Palestinians to return back home to the north. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=74.0s)]
*  And yet, as I said to the Prime Minister and to other Israeli officials today, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=80.0s)]
*  the daily toll that its military operations continue to take on innocent civilians remains too high. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=86.0s)]
*  In our discussions today, I highlighted some key steps that Israel should take to ensure that more aid reaches more people in Gaza. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=95.0s)]
*  Israel should open a rez so that assistance can flow to northern Gaza, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=104.0s)]
*  where, as I said, hundreds of thousands of people are struggling to survive under dire conditions. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=109.0s)]
*  It should expedite the flow of humanitarian assistance from Jordan. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=115.0s)]
*  It should strengthen deconfliction and improve coordination with the humanitarian providers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=119.0s)]
*  And Israel must ensure that the delivery of life-saving assistance to Gaza is not blocked for any reason by anyone. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=126.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXfwKWlvqAs&t=139.0s)]
