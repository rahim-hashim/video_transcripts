# Trump’s ‘patience ran out earlier than it should have’ on Iran nuclear deal: Fmr. U.S. Envoy to Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA)
*  Let's bring in Robert Mallee, president and CEO at the International Crisis Group, former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=0.0s)]
*  special envoy for Iran and lead negotiator on that 2015 Iran deal, also author of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  forthcoming book, Tomorrow is Yesterday, Life, Death, and the Pursuit of Peace in Israel-Palestine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=11.94s)]
*  Welcome to you, Robert. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=19.12s)]
*  So glad to talk with you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=20.12s)]
*  I'm curious, sir, your overall reaction to what's been going on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=21.36s)]
*  Where does this conflict between Iran and Israel stand today in your mind? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=25.42s)]
*  Both militarily and diplomatically. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, the first thing I'd say is never underestimate either Israeli or American capability when [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=32.4s)]
*  it comes to the military and intelligence prowess, and we've seen that particularly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=40.08s)]
*  from the Israeli side over the last week. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=43.6s)]
*  But by the same token, never overestimate their capacity to think strategically, to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=46.74s)]
*  think of a political exit ramp, and to think through the consequences of their actions. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  We're in the midst of a war that clearly Israel has established dominance over. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=56.12s)]
*  But where this goes, where this leads, and what the longer-term consequences are for [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=60.96s)]
*  Israel and the region, that's a very different matter. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=64.32s)]
*  Do you think that Israel—and I'll just use Israel on one monolithic entity—has [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=67.68s)]
*  a huge upper hand right now over Iran? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  Militarily, there's no doubt, and including what you just reported, they're able to access [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=78.36s)]
*  and to kill the top brass of the Iranian IRGC and their military, and they're doing it [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  because they have extraordinary intelligence, they've penetrated Iran, they almost certainly [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=90.24s)]
*  have assets on the ground. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=94.88s)]
*  So yes, and they control the skies. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=96.52s)]
*  Does that mean that they could achieve the political strategic victory that they are—say [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=99.66s)]
*  they're pursuing? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=103.36s)]
*  Again, that's a very different question. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=104.36s)]
*  This is a long movie. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=105.96s)]
*  We're only in the first scenes, and I think if we'd be mistaken to look at the first [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=106.96s)]
*  scenes and assume that that's how the rest is going to unfold. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=111.12s)]
*  In terms of intelligence, how close is Iran to making a nuclear weapon, and how much has [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Israel set Iran back with its targeted attacks? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=121.4s)]
*  So first, if I could take a step back, you mentioned I was part of the team that negotiated [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  the JCPOA, the nuclear deal in 2015. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=130.52s)]
*  We are—Iran is closer than ever to achieving—to getting a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=135.16s)]
*  I'll get to in a second. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=140.08s)]
*  But the reason they're closer than ever is because President Trump decided in 2018, encouraged [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=141.68s)]
*  by Prime Minister Netanyahu, to tear up the deal that had constrained, restrained, and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=146.56s)]
*  sort of put Iran's nuclear program in a box. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=150.76s)]
*  We would be nowhere as close. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=153.36s)]
*  Iran would be nowhere as close. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=155.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=156.16s)]
*  And I want to interrupt you on that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=157.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=158.52s)]
*  What is the logic that you can decipher of ripping that up and essentially affording, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=159.52s)]
*  what, now seven more years for Iran to go relatively unmonitored and do what it wants [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  to do relative to enriching uranium? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=171.8s)]
*  Because I think there was a theory of the case, and the U.S. has been guilty of it not [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=176.72s)]
*  once but several times in its history, of assuming that a country or a regime that's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=180.36s)]
*  under pressure, under sanctions, with the threat of perhaps more robust military action, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=184.44s)]
*  is going to fold, is going to surrender, and would have agreed to give up its nuclear program. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  That's not the way things work. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=195.0s)]
*  And it is extraordinary to see today, again, President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=197.12s)]
*  scream about how close Iran is when it is their actions that brought them here, and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=201.72s)]
*  now they want to take us, or they have taken us, at least Prime Minister Netanyahu, on [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=205.4s)]
*  a military adventure. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=209.8s)]
*  So that answers part of the question, how close they are. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  Listen, every intelligence service that has spoken about this has said, or the intelligence [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=215.12s)]
*  community has said that Iran had not made a decision to seek to acquire bomb, and that's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  as recently as Tzosi Gabbard said about a month ago. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=225.32s)]
*  Now, does that mean that there's a debate in Iran? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=228.64s)]
*  And certainly since over the last few months, the debate has—the last two years, the debate [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  has intensified within the Iranian leadership, whether the time had come to cross that threshold, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=235.76s)]
*  but nothing indicated they had made that decision. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=241.56s)]
*  Of course, today I assume they're even closer to making that decision than they ever were [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=244.04s)]
*  in the past. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=247.72s)]
*  So hang on. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=248.8s)]
*  You have Tzosi Gabbard saying that they weren't close to making a bomb. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=249.8s)]
*  That was not the intent. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=253.24s)]
*  You had Donald Trump saying she's flat out wrong. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=254.24s)]
*  Who's right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=258.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=259.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think viewers could reach their own conclusion. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=260.44s)]
*  I think when Tzosi Gabbard testified under oath, that was what the intelligence community [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=264.88s)]
*  had concluded. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=269.04s)]
*  Again, they all—they concluded that Iran had not made that decision. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=270.04s)]
*  And I think, again, if you listen to the experts, Iran is at least six months, perhaps a year, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=273.2s)]
*  or was before the Israeli strikes, a year away from being able to develop a nuclear [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=277.32s)]
*  weapon. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=282.0s)]
*  President Trump said what he did. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=283.0s)]
*  I don't think that that's backed up by intelligence. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=284.0s)]
*  So I would go with what was said to the Senate under oath. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=286.64s)]
*  Can I ask, is there a point after which there's no turning back, that Iran gets, you know, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=291.24s)]
*  X amount close to the prospect of building a nuclear weapon, and even if it's a few [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  weeks, a few months, that there would be no turning back? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=303.52s)]
*  Does that exist? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=307.28s)]
*  Certainly, there's a situation in which the options to stop Iran would be, if not nil, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=311.28s)]
*  close to nil. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  We were not there. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  Again, first of all, there was a diplomatic track that President Trump and his special [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  envoy were involved in, which seemed to hold some promise, at least based on the reports [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=324.08s)]
*  we heard. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=329.0s)]
*  And then there may have been other tools that could have been used. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=330.0s)]
*  There was no urgency. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=332.52s)]
*  The urgency was not a matter of Iran's nuclear intentions. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  The urgency was twofold, from Prime Minister Netanyahu's point of view. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=336.96s)]
*  One, he wanted to preempt American diplomacy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=340.92s)]
*  He didn't like the shape of what any potential agreements could have been. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=343.52s)]
*  And second, and understandably, even if I criticize it, he saw a window, a historic [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=347.8s)]
*  window of opportunity, because Iran was weaker than it had been in a very long time. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  The Islamic Republic was weaker than it had been in a very long time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=357.32s)]
*  And so Israel had the opportunity to take out, or believed it had the opportunity to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=360.62s)]
*  take out Iran's nuclear program. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=364.76s)]
*  Those were the clocks that Prime Minister Netanyahu was looking at, not how close Iran [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=367.2s)]
*  was to getting a bomb. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=371.0s)]
*  Robert, you've sat face to face with the Iranians in a number of high-stakes discussions. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=372.0s)]
*  Are good-faith negotiations with Iran truly possible, or will Iran always want to pursue [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=378.44s)]
*  nuclear weapons? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=384.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't believe in good faith. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=388.32s)]
*  I don't believe in trust. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=389.32s)]
*  What I do believe in is agreements that are enforced, that are verified. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=390.32s)]
*  And when it comes to the agreement that was signed in 2015, every report, including by [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=393.56s)]
*  the Trump administration in its first term, said Iran was complying with the deal and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=399.0s)]
*  continued to comply at least some time after President Trump withdrew. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=403.4s)]
*  So, no, I don't trust them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=407.0s)]
*  And I think you need to put in place mechanisms to make sure that you know ahead of time if [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=408.56s)]
*  Iran is about to cheat. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=413.54s)]
*  They had not cheated then. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  And if we get a new deal now, we'll have to make sure that we have transparency, absolute [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=416.04s)]
*  transparency to know what Iran is doing ahead of time. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=420.32s)]
*  And what are the challenges to verifying that Iran is complying with any deal, be it that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=423.52s)]
*  which you did and helped put together in 2015 or something that may come now? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, the challenges in some ways have gotten worse. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=434.44s)]
*  I mean, they've gotten better because Iran's nuclear program is a shadow of what it once [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=437.32s)]
*  was. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=441.4s)]
*  It's gotten worse because we just don't know what's happened the last few days, weeks. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=442.4s)]
*  Has Iran tried to hide some of its nuclear material? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=446.64s)]
*  And would it lie about that? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  What you need is the IEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that has inspectors [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=450.46000000000004s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=454.98s)]
*  And you need them to be there as much, as often as possible, to have access to any place [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=455.98s)]
*  where they suspect activity is taking place. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=459.86s)]
*  Don't forget again that you also have American and Israeli and other intelligence resources [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=462.78000000000003s)]
*  that, as Israel has proved, has really been able to penetrate Iran and would therefore [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=467.34000000000003s)]
*  probably know again if Iran made a decision to weaponize before it was too late. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=473.54s)]
*  Robert, Trump demanded Iran's unconditional surrender in the latest negotiations, which [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=480.21999999999997s)]
*  didn't happen. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=485.41999999999996s)]
*  If you could advise this administration, what strategies would you suggest first to get [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=486.41999999999996s)]
*  Iran back to the negotiating table? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=491.06s)]
*  And then second, how would you approach these discussions? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=493.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, the one thing that one has to understand, and I don't think it's only true of Iran, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=499.14s)]
*  but this regime is not going to surrender unconditionally. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=503.09999999999997s)]
*  That's like assuming that the fear of death is going to lead them to commit suicide. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=507.38s)]
*  They believe that if they were to give in completely to President Trump's demands, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=511.14000000000004s)]
*  it would be sooner or later the end of the regime. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=514.3000000000001s)]
*  So they would prefer taking their chances, fighting this out, even if at the cost of [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=516.66s)]
*  Israel or the United States bombing Fordow, their last remaining real nuclear site, and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=521.98s)]
*  just hope to wait for a better day. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=527.3000000000001s)]
*  So I think what needs to be put on the table is something more realistic, very demanding [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=530.3000000000001s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=534.54s)]
*  And again, what Steve Woodcock, the envoy, President Trump's envoy, was discussing with [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=535.5799999999999s)]
*  his counterpart, the Iranian foreign minister, seemed to be something that had potential. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=539.9s)]
*  It needed more time, and President Trump is often a man in a hurry, and a man in a hurry [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=546.3s)]
*  means a man who's often impatient, and I think his patience ran out earlier than it should have. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZ9rPbJWaA&t=550.9s)]
