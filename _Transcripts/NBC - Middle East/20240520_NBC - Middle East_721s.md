# David Ignatius: Death of Iran's president adds to more instability in region
**NBC - Middle East:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4)
*  Major breaking news that happened overnight. Iranian state media is reporting that the nation's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=0.0s)]
*  President Raisi and the country's foreign minister have died in a helicopter crash. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=6.08s)]
*  Search teams arrived at the site of what was originally called a hard landing and found no [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=12.16s)]
*  sign of life. According to a news outlet affiliated with the Iranian government, seven other officials [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=18.64s)]
*  were on board the aircraft at the time of the accident. The Associated Press cites Iranian [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=24.96s)]
*  state TV as giving no immediate cause for the collision, although weather could be a factor. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  The group was returning from an event near Iran's border with Azerbaijan when the helicopter [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=36.4s)]
*  crashed. Heavy fog prevented search and rescue teams from finding the wreckage for hours. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=42.88s)]
*  A hardline conservative within the Iranian political landscape, Raisi, had been Iran's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  president since 2021. David Ignatius, your thoughts and concerns given this breaking news. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=54.64s)]
*  Mika, at a time when there's war and instability across the Middle East, this adds one more element. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=60.72s)]
*  It's unlikely to mean any sharp change in Iranian policy. The true leader is the supreme leader, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=67.6s)]
*  Ali Khamenei. He remains in charge, but he's 85. And Raisi, the president, was widely seen as the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=73.76s)]
*  most likely successor to him. So this creates a kind of succession quandary for Iran. In the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=81.12s)]
*  immediate future, the current vice president, whose name is Mohammed Mukhbar, will become interim [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=88.64s)]
*  president. In effect, elections will be declared 50 days from now. In theory, we'll have a new [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  Iranian president. That person isn't likely to be fundamentally different in terms of policies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=101.84s)]
*  This is a regime that moves in step. But in terms of the future after Ayatollah Khamenei, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=106.48s)]
*  this is an interesting development. There's talk that Khamenei's own son, Moshe Tver, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  might be a leading candidate. He's said to be favored by the IRGC. I just note one other [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  interesting phenomenon here. Even as Iran has been deepening its confrontation with Israel, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=125.2s)]
*  firing 100 ballistic missiles and more than 200 drones in April, none of which were successful. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=133.12s)]
*  It's been trying to open more of a dialogue with the United States. Last week, an Iranian [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=139.36s)]
*  foreign ministry official met with Brett McGurk, our top NSC Middle East person in Oman, to talk [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=146.16s)]
*  about issues of mutual concern. At the time of that missile strike, the Iranians made an effort [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=152.56s)]
*  to contact the U.S. through the Swiss embassy, exchange messages, understand exactly who would [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=158.64s)]
*  do what. So I think we're heading into a period where, as Khamenei himself said, there'll be no [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  disruption in Iranian policy. But think about it. You've got uncertainty in Iran. You've got [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=171.76s)]
*  uncertainty in Israel. You now have almost an open contest for future leadership of Israel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  And you've got an American presidential election. You couldn't have a more unstable mix of factors [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  over the Middle East at this most dangerous time. And certainly, Admiral, we've heard about the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=190.08s)]
*  dangers, the great dangers that we've been facing in the region, obviously since October 7th and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=197.44s)]
*  certainly with Iran. I will say, though, it's fascinating hearing what David said regarding [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  Iran's contacts with the Swiss embassy. I heard the same thing, and I'm sure you did too, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=210.72s)]
*  after the killing of Soleimani. The Iranians fired some missiles at U.S. targets and then [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=216.0s)]
*  immediately told people in the region, please get back to the United States. That's it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=223.12s)]
*  We had to show some force for domestic consumption. You, of course, had the United States [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=229.12s)]
*  warning Iran back channel about an imminent attack, a terror attack a few months ago. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=236.32s)]
*  Things are not always as cut and dry as they appear. And I'd just love for you to go through [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=243.92s)]
*  your decades of experience dealing in the region, dealing with Iran directly or indirectly, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  and give us your best read on where we go from here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  The only thing I know for sure is that the vice president of the United States will not be going [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  to Tehran to attend this particular funeral. There's certainly no love lost between our two [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=266.32s)]
*  countries. But I think, Joe, you and David are right to highlight two aspects of this that jump [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=272.64s)]
*  out at me. Number one, the presidency of Iran, which will have to be filled and will be filled, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  is not the prize here. The prize is who is the next supreme leader. Khamenei, the current [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=286.72s)]
*  incumbent, has cancer, mid-80s. Certainly that's going to come sooner rather than later. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  I'd put my money on his son more than anybody else, but nobody knows the answer to that question, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  and that's going to drive a lot of internal maneuver and politics. And, oh, by the way, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=308.56s)]
*  if we think here in the United States we're prone to conspiracy theory, certainly Iran, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=315.68s)]
*  its populace, is prone to it, starved of actual information. Look for conspiracy theories that'll [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=322.32s)]
*  pop up about who might have manufactured this, was Israel involved, was the CIA part of this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=329.2s)]
*  The answer to all those questions are almost certainly no. Bad weather, probably bad maintenance, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  probably bad airmanship is what caused this. But the second big thing here, and again you alluded [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  to it a moment ago, is that Iran does not want this to explode into a wider regional war. This [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=350.16s)]
*  is the last thing they would want now while they're in the midst of their version of Game of Thrones [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  here. So look for the Iranians to send signals to the United States, potentially to other actors [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=363.28s)]
*  in the region. They're close in the Arab world with Qatar, relatively so. Look for them to signal, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  look, let us alone right now. We've got to sort this out. Now's not the time for anyone to take [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  advantage. And Richard, following up on that, obviously this president died at the time when [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=386.8s)]
*  he'd been facing domestic unrest. So economically Iran's been struggling. We can look back over the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=393.76s)]
*  past 10, 15 years and see that Iran is divided. You sort of have red state Iran, blue state Iran, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=401.2s)]
*  in that the urban center is far different than rural Iran. This is a country divided trying to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=410.48s)]
*  figure out its way forward. It would seem to me the last thing they would want to do is begin a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=416.64s)]
*  regional war. They got a lot on their plate, I agree. Let's say a few things because I think [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=421.2s)]
*  both the Admiral and David got it exactly right. One is Raisi's legacy is not real impressive, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  Joe, and it gets at what you're saying. What was it about? It was about repression. He leaves a [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=433.12s)]
*  more divided society and real economic mismanagement. The currency is much weaker and so forth. That's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  essentially what he's done. I think the fact that he's out of the running because he's dead for [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=444.56s)]
*  the supreme leader is interesting because it does go to his son. If it does go to Khamenei's son, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=450.32s)]
*  then it raises real question of hereditary processes here. And the question is, does that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=455.36s)]
*  detract from the legitimacy of the supreme leader? So I think the death of the president has almost [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=462.4s)]
*  no impact in the short run because the president doesn't have a lot of authority over the things [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=468.56s)]
*  we would talk about on the show, national security and so forth. It's more of a domestic role. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=473.36s)]
*  The real question is, what implications does it have for the long-term legitimacy of the regime? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=478.4s)]
*  And it gets at the splits within the society. My own guess, though, is this regime probably has, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=484.56s)]
*  unfortunately, more staying power or continuity than any of us would like to see. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=490.24s)]
*  I, yeah, no doubt about that. David, Ignatius, so following up, I think fascinating insight [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=496.32s)]
*  by Richard when he's talking about how if being the supreme leader of Iran is more hereditary, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=505.04s)]
*  that further weakens, at least in the eyes of Shia in that region, the standing of, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=513.36s)]
*  at least religiously, leadership in Iran compared to Sistani, who's still in Iraq, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=520.08s)]
*  who still really is seen as the supreme Shiite leader. And this sort of hereditary [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=526.96s)]
*  pass down would, I think, possibly even weaken Iran's ultimate influence in Iraq. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=535.2s)]
*  So, Joe, to me, Raisi, the president now dead, was a symbol of a regime that in many ways is [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=543.36s)]
*  running out of gas. He was not a distinguished cleric. He wasn't somebody whose religious views [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=551.92s)]
*  were taken seriously. He was the enforcer. He was a judge. He was the person who, when Ayatollah [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=558.16s)]
*  Khomeini wanted to clean up in the late 80s, was assigned the job, judge of basically being the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=564.8s)]
*  hanging judge and is said to have executed, sent to the execution more than a thousand people. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=571.84s)]
*  He was the reliable servant of the revolution, but he didn't enhance or expand that revolution. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=577.6s)]
*  And during his time as president, we saw young Iranians just an explosion of celebrating personal [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=583.2800000000001s)]
*  freedom, women taking off their headscarves, throwing them away, risking, at least for some [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  weeks and months, being arrested. For a long time, the regime couldn't get that back under control. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=597.68s)]
*  So, as a Western diplomat has said to me once, you need to think of Iran as being on a one-way street. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=604.2399999999999s)]
*  That street is toward the end of the regime. How fast it will go down that street, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  hard to tell. It could be many, many years. They're still very powerful. But there's no [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  sign of this regime really rehabilitating itself in the eyes of its people. Raisi was not a charismatic [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=622.8s)]
*  person. And there's little likelihood that the successors who come into place now will be any more so. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=629.52s)]
*  The White House, of course, carefully watching developments unfold here, was about a 12-hour [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  or so search before these rescue crews found the helicopter, downed helicopter, no signs of life. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=642.24s)]
*  And those that I spoke to in the last 24 hours were so really concerned that Iran would try to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=648.88s)]
*  point the fingers elsewhere for this crash, namely at Israel, suggesting that they'd rather push this [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=653.36s)]
*  conspiracy that someone else did this, rather than accept fault that they couldn't protect their own [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=658.88s)]
*  president, that it was just simply a crash. That, to this point, has not happened in any real way. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=664.24s)]
*  Doesn't mean, of course, that could not change in the days ahead. In a particularly unstable region, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=668.96s)]
*  also, U.S. officials are telling me they're watching it. What, if any, response might be from some of [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=673.36s)]
*  Iran's prox groups, Hezbollah and the like, if they try to use this as some sort of impetus [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=677.12s)]
*  to spark further violence at a time of real war in Gaza, at a time when the world is watching to [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=682.24s)]
*  see when Israel's push into Ra'aafa might begin, but at least to this point, relatively calm. But [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=686.96s)]
*  if this, Mika, the helicopter's only been recovered in the last few hours, U.S. officials speaking to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=692.72s)]
*  allies in the region to try to get a sense of stability. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7CZMH-5U4&t=698.16s)]
