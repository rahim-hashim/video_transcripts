# Will U.S. military retaliatory strikes deter Iranian proxies or spark a wider regional conflict?
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo)
*  The U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against Iranian-backed militias are just the beginning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=0.0s)]
*  of a campaign that the Pentagon says could last weeks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=7.16s)]
*  Will they deter further attacks against U.S. forces in the region and international shipping [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=10.68s)]
*  in the Red Sea, or could this escalate into a broader war? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Missy Ryan, national security reporter for The Washington Post. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=18.76s)]
*  Missy, thanks so much for coming in. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=22.56s)]
*  First of all, Iran's foreign ministry now calling the U.S. strikes a strategic mistake [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=24.28s)]
*  that will only increase tension and instability in the region. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=29.68s)]
*  So how does the U.S. military go about threading the needle between deterring Iran and also [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=33.32s)]
*  not sparking the wider conflict the president and Iran says they both don't want? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=38.84s)]
*  Yes, Andrea, well, that's exactly what the U.S. military and the Biden administration [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=43.68s)]
*  more generally is trying to do, thread the needle in terms of eroding the military capability [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=48.5s)]
*  forces, the Iranian-backed militias and the IRGC itself, to conduct these attacks on American [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=56.34s)]
*  forces in the region. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=63.42s)]
*  So that would be drone facilities. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=64.66s)]
*  We saw them hit command and control nodes, intelligence sites, other sort of depots, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=66.94s)]
*  weapons depots. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=72.94s)]
*  They're trying to reduce their military capability and also send a message to Tehran that the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=74.54s)]
*  Biden administration is more serious about this, more willing to risk regional instability [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=81.74s)]
*  than it has been in the past without tipping into a direct conflict with Iran. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=89.46s)]
*  And I think that's why we didn't see any direct strikes into Iran itself. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=95.06s)]
*  That clearly would have been an option. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=99.96s)]
*  But the Biden administration chose to target Iranian assets outside of Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  And that's what the United States have done in the past. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=107.61999999999999s)]
*  Iran has shown itself willing to tolerate those kind of attacks to a certain extent [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  in a way that they probably wouldn't if the United States struck within Iran. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=114.98s)]
*  While not hitting Iran territorially, but you know better than I how critical the Quds [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=120.42s)]
*  Force, the IRGC is, the military wing of the regime. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  So how do we know how much damage we did to the Quds Force's capabilities? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=130.58s)]
*  The general who spoke with us last night, General Sims, said that the United States [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=137.26s)]
*  would get a better idea as the sun comes up in the region. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=142.38s)]
*  So that's a process that's ongoing right now in terms of getting the battle damage [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=145.26s)]
*  assessment. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=149.66s)]
*  They'll be looking at the extent of the physical damage. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=150.66s)]
*  And they'll also be collecting intelligence about the operational impact and then potentially [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=153.38s)]
*  the sort of intentions, what they hope will be a change in intentions on the part of the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=159.3s)]
*  Quds Force, the IRGC and Iran, the Iranian leadership. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=166.54s)]
*  So, you know, I think there's no expectation that Iran is going to change its overall [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=171.14s)]
*  position on the U.S. military presence in the region. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  And this really now decades long antagonism that we've seen going back to the 1980s [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=180.42s)]
*  between the U.S. and Iranian proxies and the Middle East. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=186.89999999999998s)]
*  But I think the really the hope that the Biden administration has here is that it can get [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=190.18s)]
*  back to a more tenable detente, a more tenable sort of low level standoff that we saw [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=194.26s)]
*  for a while before the events of October 7th. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=201.62s)]
*  Of course, it wasn't the Quds Force that was involved with the shipping. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  Was the Quds Force involved with the deaths of the three Americans? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=211.26s)]
*  There's no evidence that we've seen that it was directly involved. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=217.82s)]
*  And this really gets, Andrea, to the interesting question of the dynamics and the relationship [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=220.78s)]
*  between the IRGC, the Quds Force and its proxy clients in Iraq and Syria, the level of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=226.38s)]
*  direction that they may or may not play. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=234.94s)]
*  And I think there's an assumption that Iran is really has the ability to direct these [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=237.54s)]
*  militants in a way that it might not have. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=242.82s)]
*  Clearly, Iran has provided, you know, weapons. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=245.34s)]
*  They provided training. They're there in those countries to a certain extent. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=249.74s)]
*  But these groups also have their own local agendas, I think, to varying degrees. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=253.9s)]
*  Lebanese Hezbollah is much closer to Iran than these militias in Iraq and Syria. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  And then the Houthis in Yemen are a different in a different category. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  I really think they have much more autonomy and independence. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=266.42s)]
*  It won't necessarily take directions from Tehran in a way that some of the other groups will. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=269.1s)]
*  So it's a very complex situation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=275.14s)]
*  And I don't know that the U.S. government has full visibility into the agency and dynamics [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=277.02000000000004s)]
*  sort of behind the scenes there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=282.1s)]
*  But what they're clearly hoping to accomplish with these attacks is an erosion of military [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=283.86s)]
*  capability and then sending a message to Tehran. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=289.38s)]
*  And I think we also have to note that it also is there's a there's a necessity for President [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=292.94s)]
*  Biden here in an election year to send a message to his domestic constituency and to the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=297.38s)]
*  Republicans who are criticizing him for not acting strongly enough. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJBR7_sEwo&t=302.70000000000005s)]
