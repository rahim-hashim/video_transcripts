# Will two weeks ever come?: How Trump is ‘kicking the can down the road’ in Israel-Iran conflict
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE)
*  Welcome to the weekend. I'm Jonathan Capehart along with Eugene Daniels. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=0.0s)]
*  Jackie Alamany is on parental leave. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=5.0s)]
*  We begin with the conflict in the Middle East where Israel and Iran traded fresh strikes [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=7.0s)]
*  a day after the first face-to-face meeting between Western and Iranian officials [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=13.0s)]
*  since the start of the fighting ended with little progress. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=18.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is still weighing U.S. military action against Iran, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=21.0s)]
*  buying himself some time by saying he'll make his decision, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=26.0s)]
*  within the next two weeks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=30.0s)]
*  He teased his decision about a potential strike again yesterday. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=33.0s)]
*  I'm giving him a period of time. We're going to see what that period of time is. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=38.0s)]
*  But I'm giving him a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=42.0s)]
*  Talks yesterday between Iran and top European diplomats in Geneva ended with no signs of a breakthrough. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=47.0s)]
*  Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, did not attend. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=54.0s)]
*  In an exclusive interview with NBC News' Andrea Mitchell, Iran's foreign minister said [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=58.0s)]
*  Iran is uncertain if it can trust the United States in further diplomatic talks. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=63.0s)]
*  Can diplomacy produce a solution in two weeks? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's up to, you know, Americans, the United States, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=74.0s)]
*  I mean, to show their determination for going for a negotiated solution, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=83.0s)]
*  or they have something else in their mind and they want to attack Iran anyway. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=95.0s)]
*  So they have perhaps this plan and they just needed negotiations, perhaps, to cover it up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=100.0s)]
*  We don't know how we can trust them anymore. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=111.0s)]
*  What they did was in fact a betrayal to diplomacy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=118.0s)]
*  Today, the foreign minister also accused the United States of being involved in Israel's attacks on Iran, quote, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=124.0s)]
*  from day one. As for President Trump, he's set to receive another intelligence briefing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=131.0s)]
*  from his National Security Council later today after returning to the White House. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=137.0s)]
*  But late yesterday, he broke with his intelligence community and the director of national intelligence, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=142.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, about Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=149.0s)]
*  What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=154.0s)]
*  Your intelligence community has said they have no evidence that they are at this point. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=157.0s)]
*  Well, then my intelligence community is wrong. Who in the intelligence community said that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=160.0s)]
*  Your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=165.0s)]
*  She's wrong. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=168.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Alex Ward, national security reporter for the Wall Street Journal, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=170.0s)]
*  but you can guess what your first question is going to be, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=175.0s)]
*  and April Ryan, Washington bureau chief and White House correspondent for Black Press USA [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=177.0s)]
*  and host of The Tea with April Ryan on Substack. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=182.0s)]
*  Thank you both very much for coming to the weekend. So, Alex, come on now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=187.0s)]
*  To which part? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=193.0s)]
*  I know. So, let's just start with Tulsi Gabbard of it all. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=194.0s)]
*  The president said she is, quote, wrong on Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=197.0s)]
*  He says the intelligence community is wrong. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=202.0s)]
*  What say you, national security reporter for the Wall Street Journal? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=205.0s)]
*  Well, what she said is accurate, that Iran has not made a decision to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=208.0s)]
*  But interestingly, there are elements of the intelligence community, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=214.0s)]
*  including CIA director John Radcliffe, who is basically making a football analogy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=217.0s)]
*  Why would Iran get to the 99-yard line in terms of building weapons program [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=221.0s)]
*  if it wasn't attempting to score a touchdown, game situation dependent? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=225.0s)]
*  But basically what they're saying is, and this is true, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=229.0s)]
*  and we've talked to a lot of nuclear experts and experts on Iran and what they've been doing, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=232.0s)]
*  they are giving themselves the bomb option. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=236.0s)]
*  They are having, they are doing a bunch of research on devices, on having enriched uranium. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=239.0s)]
*  So basically, if the supreme leader were to say, I want a bomb, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=245.0s)]
*  they're not far off from getting one. But that decision is quite crucial. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=249.0s)]
*  And so what Tulsi Gabbard did tell the House in March, the House Intelligence Committee, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=253.0s)]
*  was to say Iran has not made that decision. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=257.0s)]
*  But what she did not say in that briefing was all that other stuff we just discussed, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=260.0s)]
*  which is all the work they've been doing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=264.0s)]
*  April, one of the things that we all know, having covered Trump for a long time, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=266.0s)]
*  is the two weeks time last month. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=270.0s)]
*  Play some sound for that and then get you on the other side. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=273.0s)]
*  We're going to be sending letters out in about a week and a half, two weeks, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=279.0s)]
*  to countries telling them what the deal is. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=283.0s)]
*  Do you still believe that Putin actually wants to end the war? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=286.0s)]
*  I can't tell you that, but I'll let you know in about two weeks. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=290.0s)]
*  In your mind, is Ukraine doing enough to get this deal? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=293.0s)]
*  I'd rather tell you in about two weeks from now, because I can't say yes or no. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=297.0s)]
*  The world is a much safer place right now, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=302.0s)]
*  and I think in two or three weeks we could have it be a much, much safer place. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=305.0s)]
*  At some point in the next two weeks or three weeks, I'm going to be setting the deal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=310.0s)]
*  April, sometimes those two weeks never come. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=317.0s)]
*  We've seen it over and over. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=320.0s)]
*  Those two weeks never come. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=322.0s)]
*  So one, what do we know about where the president is in the decision making, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=324.0s)]
*  and is he just punting here? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=329.0s)]
*  So it reminds me of the first term when he kept saying infrastructure week. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=330.0s)]
*  It never came. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=334.0s)]
*  Or his health care plan. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=335.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. Two weeks. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=336.0s)]
*  That two weeks is nothing but kicking the can down the road, hoping that we forget. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=338.0s)]
*  But this two weeks is kind of dangerous, because he has pushed so far and so hard. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=342.0s)]
*  This is more serious than anything he's ever done before. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=348.0s)]
*  You don't poke the bear and think the bear's not going to come go, rawr. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=351.0s)]
*  And the bear is Iran. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=355.0s)]
*  And the bottom line is, this president is playing this game, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=357.0s)]
*  walking away from Tulsi Gobert, who says, talking about the intelligence that they have on this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=361.0s)]
*  It reminds me almost of WMD, weapons of mass destruction, back in- [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=368.0s)]
*  20 years ago. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=373.0s)]
*  Yes, 20 years ago. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=374.0s)]
*  Do we have it, do we not? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=376.0s)]
*  But here's the bottom line. Yeah, ish. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=378.0s)]
*  But here's the bottom line. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=380.0s)]
*  Former President Barack Obama knew that we didn't know enough about what the capabilities were, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=382.0s)]
*  what Iran had, and he started working out a deal to quantify possibly and qualify. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=388.0s)]
*  Then President Trump came in just because he hates Obama, ripped it up. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=394.0s)]
*  And now he says, I don't want a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=399.0s)]
*  Well, you pushed us to the point- [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=401.0s)]
*  And then Biden brought it back and he ripped it up again. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=403.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=405.0s)]
*  But he's pushed us to the point now that we might be at a point of no return, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=407.0s)]
*  that two weeks may be, it may be really off the table, because right now you don't know what's here in this nation, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=410.0s)]
*  sleeper cells, long wolves who are listening and watching. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=417.0s)]
*  This is a dangerous back and forth about two weeks. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=420.0s)]
*  So Alex, sorry. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=424.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=425.0s)]
*  On that point, where do we, what do you have reporting on that, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=426.0s)]
*  where the president is and his decision-making process? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=430.0s)]
*  You guys wrote about that this week. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=433.0s)]
*  Yeah, so on Tuesday when he had a National Security Council meeting, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=435.0s)]
*  he was presented with attack plans on Iran, including going after Fordow, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=438.0s)]
*  which is the nuclear site that is deep within a mountain about a mile and a half a mile, excuse me, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=443.0s)]
*  underneath that mountain that would require pretty large American bombs in order to destroy. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=448.0s)]
*  He approved of those plans, but he did not give a final order. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=452.0s)]
*  So effectively he has the defense community, the military community being prepared for if he were to say go, to go. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=456.0s)]
*  But once you make that decision, once you get those attack plans ready, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=463.0s)]
*  it does build a bit of momentum towards saying go. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=468.0s)]
*  Now, he can always pull back and it seems like he has with this two weeks play. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=471.0s)]
*  But he's now having meetings with people like Steve Bannon about whether or not actually going ahead would break the MAGA coalition. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=475.0s)]
*  He's having meetings with people, the traditional Republican hawks who would like him to go ahead and even push further towards regime change. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=483.0s)]
*  He's caught in a bit of a bind here between his own politics and the military situation. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=490.0s)]
*  So of all the people he's talking to, let's put up the list of folks, the advisors he's talking to about whether he should strike Iran. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=495.0s)]
*  A bunch of people there. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=507.0s)]
*  The couple people who are noticeably not there. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=509.0s)]
*  One we've already talked about, the DNI, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=513.0s)]
*  But if you're going to do a possible strike on Iran, shouldn't the Secretary of Defense be among the people he's talking to? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=516.0s)]
*  I just want to put that up there so people can understand. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=525.0s)]
*  The question I was going to ask you after April was talking about what she was saying. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=528.0s)]
*  Do they even have a day, are they even discussing a day after plan? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=535.0s)]
*  It's one thing to decide whether to strike Iran, but then there's, well, what happens after that? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=542.0s)]
*  Are they having that discussion? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=548.0s)]
*  Well, that is one of the most underappreciated conversations in the national security world. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=550.0s)]
*  What next? What then? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=554.0s)]
*  That tends to come, unfortunately, after the fact of day one. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=556.0s)]
*  I can't say for sure that they're having it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=560.0s)]
*  Right now they're having a discussion about what to do and whether or not to do it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=562.0s)]
*  The Pentagon, luckily, is a planning organization. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=566.0s)]
*  One has to assume that they have an after plan. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=568.0s)]
*  But the problem here is you can plan as much as you'd like, and you should, but no one really knows what Iran would do next. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=571.0s)]
*  Would they start attacking U.S. troops in the Middle East? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=577.0s)]
*  Would they look at potential weak spots of the U.S., which would include diplomatic facilities in Latin America or Western Africa? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=580.0s)]
*  Would they launch large cyber attacks? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=588.0s)]
*  Would they coordinate more closely with Russia or China? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=590.0s)]
*  They have this, not an alliance, but this relationship of convenience. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=592.0s)]
*  There are many options that they have available to use Trump's parlance. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=596.0s)]
*  They have cards to play. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=599.0s)]
*  Granted, the U.S. is the stronger actor. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=600.0s)]
*  Israel is a stronger actor. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=602.0s)]
*  Both those countries I just mentioned have nuclear weapons, but Iran does have cards to play. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=603.0s)]
*  And that gets to what you were saying before about the concerns about what could happen here in the United States if the United States does something. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=606.0s)]
*  Because it doesn't have to happen immediately after, right? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=613.0s)]
*  There's the conversation happening right now about what's happening in Iran is that they're decimated, right? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=616.0s)]
*  That they're on their back heels. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=622.0s)]
*  But that could also just be them waiting to strike later, right? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=624.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be tomorrow, the next year. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=626.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=629.0s)]
*  This is a now situation. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=631.0s)]
*  People are watching. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=633.0s)]
*  They're listening. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=634.0s)]
*  And believe me, this country, it's still a very open country. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=635.0s)]
*  Even though we put these barricades just outside of the windows up at the Capitol and around the White House, there, we are a very open society and anything could happen. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=640.0s)]
*  But here's the piece that really brings home Yelinsky. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=649.0s)]
*  Yelinsky said, hey, you've got a body of water between you, but it's going to happen. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=653.0s)]
*  And that kind of makes me think about what he said in the Oval Office when President Trump ran him out of the Oval Office a couple of months ago. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=657.0s)]
*  We are an open society. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=664.0s)]
*  And not only that, think about this, though. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=666.0s)]
*  And you guys hit on it, and it's the elephant in the conversation in the room, forgive the pun, but he's just now starting to get intelligence. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=669.0s)]
*  He's just now starting. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=677.0s)]
*  Since Thursday, we're seeing consistent briefings. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=678.0s)]
*  And before that, how often was the president briefing, getting briefs, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=682.0s)]
*  He's just starting. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=687.0s)]
*  Once a week, was it bullet points? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=688.0s)]
*  Was it a show and tell? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=690.0s)]
*  What was it? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=691.0s)]
*  Was it pictorial? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=692.0s)]
*  I mean, because every day presidents used to get a book. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=693.0s)]
*  Before this president, they used to get a book, basically, of what's going on around the world. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=696.0s)]
*  And now he's playing catch up. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=700.0s)]
*  He's doing the quick notes. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=701.0s)]
*  This is not that moment to do quick notes. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=703.0s)]
*  Alex, real fast. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=705.0s)]
*  I just want to get your reaction to the president of the United States saying, the Wall Street Journal has no idea what my thoughts are concerning Iran. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=706.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=713.0s)]
*  Well, one, not a denial of our story. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=714.0s)]
*  Two, you're right. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=717.0s)]
*  I don't know what his thoughts are, but even he said no one knows what I'm going to do, which includes himself. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=720.0s)]
*  And then three, you know, we're going to continue to report on this president and his decision making on one of the most important decisions he's made of this presidency. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=724.0s)]
*  With that said, Alex, thank you for coming on April 9th. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=732.0s)]
*  Thank you for coming on April. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=735.0s)]
*  Ryan is sticking around. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIgcK2NkdIE&t=736.0s)]
