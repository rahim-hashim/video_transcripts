# Pres. Biden say U.S. military strikes will continue at 'times and places of our choosing'
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8)
*  And joining us now, MSNBC Chief International Analyst, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=0.0s)]
*  Admiral James Tavides. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=6.28s)]
*  Admiral, thank you so much for being with us on this special edition, weekend edition [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=7.8s)]
*  of our show. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about the targeting, the first phase, the command and control operations, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  intelligence centers, weapons facilities, supply lines, and particularly going after [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=17.84s)]
*  the Quds Force, the military arm of the Iranian regime, but not Iran's territory itself. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=21.48s)]
*  Not the naval assets that might come in the next phase. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  What is your analysis of this first strike? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=33.04s)]
*  Well, if you'll permit the old grizzled Admiral nautical metaphor, we're sailing in a very [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=36.16s)]
*  narrow channel here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=42.04s)]
*  On the one side is not doing enough, and that's clearly what's been happening. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=44.2s)]
*  On the right side of that channel is where we are now, which is striking against Iranian [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  assets, but not inside Iran. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=55.56s)]
*  That's very important to the calculus here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=59.88s)]
*  And I think that that will communicate a distinct signal to the Iranians that we are quite serious. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  We are going to elevate, continue that vertical ladder of escalation as necessary. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  And I think you're correct, Andrea, the next phase here would be to go out to sea and go [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=76.16s)]
*  after Iranian ships, oil and gas platforms, intelligence assets. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=81.64s)]
*  We're not there yet. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  Let's hope we don't get there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Let's hope the mullahs in Tehran are listening to the signal that was sent last night. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=89.64s)]
*  And it strikes me that the head of the Quds Force was General Soleimani, who is considered [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  a martyr in Iran because he was assassinated in Iraq, on Iraqi territory by the Trump administration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=102.8s)]
*  And in fact, there have been retaliation threats and death threats against all of the national [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=113.84s)]
*  security officials who were directly involved in those decisions. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=121.4s)]
*  To this day, it's well known, it's been widely reported that they have security. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=124.36s)]
*  So they take it very seriously that the Quds Force has a broad reach. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=130.12s)]
*  They have reached into the U.S., into Washington itself with an attempted assassination against [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=134.32s)]
*  the Saudi ambassador in a prominent restaurant right in the middle of Georgetown. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  Indeed, Cafe Milano someplace you and I have been a bunch of times. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=145.0s)]
*  And let's face it, yes, the Quds Force has a lot of reach. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=150.88s)]
*  They also know that the United States of America has a lot of reach. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=154.6s)]
*  And if I were General Soleimani, who is the current head of the Quds Force and took the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  place of General Soleimani, I would not be traveling to Baghdad anytime soon. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=163.12s)]
*  So this plays both ways. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=170.16s)]
*  I think at this stage of things, you're going to see the action unfold in the region, in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=173.08s)]
*  Syria, in Iraq. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=179.88s)]
*  U.S. does not want to strike Iran. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=181.56s)]
*  Iran does not want to conduct an assassination against, for example, John Bolton at this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=184.04s)]
*  point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=188.76s)]
*  Let's hope that both actors want to keep this at least inside the region. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=190.16s)]
*  I think they will. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  But Andrei, your point, it's worth worrying about that second order effect. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  That could be the spark that really lights this thing off. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=201.48s)]
*  We've seen so far relative restraint from Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=205.32s)]
*  They're part of the government there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=209.16s)]
*  They were devastated with the last war with Israel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=210.44s)]
*  They clearly do not seem to want another war, at least so far, and it may, may well have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=213.48s)]
*  been deterred by the two carrier groups that the U.S. sent very early after October 7th. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  That said, Iran does not seem to at least take in any messages, messages passed by Jake [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=225.76s)]
*  Sullivan to China to please get Iran to stop this attack by the Houthis against U.S. and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=231.92s)]
*  international shipping. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=239.6s)]
*  What is the likelihood that the Houthis will back off? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=242.72s)]
*  Let me start with Hezbollah and just agree with you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=247.04s)]
*  I think it's unlikely Hezbollah goes big here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=249.96s)]
*  They've got 130,000 surface-to-surface missiles they could direct against Israel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=253.64s)]
*  They know that would be existential for them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=260.04s)]
*  Israel would simply flatten southern Lebanon. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=264.48s)]
*  I think the United States would be part of that campaign. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=267.2s)]
*  So I think that's unlikely. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=270.24s)]
*  The Houthis, unfortunately, Andrea, very much the most difficult of these proxies for the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=272.22s)]
*  Iranians to control. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=278.58000000000004s)]
*  They're going to continue, I think, to go after shipping. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  We had a very uncomfortable incident. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  U.S. Navy destroyer had to use its last-ditch defense system. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=286.18s)]
*  I used to command a destroyer of that type. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=291.1s)]
*  If you'd told me I was using my close-in weapons system to destroy a cruise missile, I would [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=293.86s)]
*  have been a very nervous captain. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=299.5s)]
*  So Houthis are going to continue to fire away. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=301.38s)]
*  I hope that Iran can reel them in. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  I think they can. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  That'll be the most difficult group to control. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=310.42s)]
*  Hezbollah, I think, is firmly under the control of Tehran and unlikely to undertake a big [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=312.7s)]
*  campaign against Israel. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=318.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpOlcT2AmY8&t=331.3s)]
