# ‘Not sure it puts us closer to ending the war in Gaza’: Ben Rhodes on the ceasefire’s effect
**NBC - Middle East:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs)
*  Joining us now, Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser for the Obama administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=0.0s)]
*  So, Ben, what could the ceasefire deal mean for the hostages? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=5.12s)]
*  There is a theory by some, a hope, that this isolates Hamas, that Hamas is weakened without [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=9.36s)]
*  Hezbollah having its back, being able to attack from the north if this were to hold. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=15.68s)]
*  Does it weaken Hamas? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  There's even reporting in Israel, which we have not confirmed, that some so-called spokesmen [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=24.2s)]
*  for Hamas is saying that they're now ready to reach a deal with reaching out to Turkey [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  and to Egypt and to Qatar. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=36.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it isolates Hamas to the extent that Hezbollah had joined the hostilities [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=38.24s)]
*  essentially after October 7th, was firing rockets from Lebanon into Israel, and that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=45.68s)]
*  both Hezbollah and Iran in some ways have been knocked back, on Hezbollah significantly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=51.66s)]
*  so with the decapitation of its leadership. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=57.1s)]
*  But the reality is that there's always been one theater in Gaza that was the fulcrum of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=59.74s)]
*  this war. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=63.9s)]
*  And with respect to the hostages, I think the challenge is there's still just this profound [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=65.4s)]
*  kind of existential gap between what you hear is the Hamas position in the negotiations [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=70.5s)]
*  and the Israeli position in the negotiations, which is that Hamas insists that any ceasefire [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=76.02s)]
*  in Gaza be a permanent cessation of hostilities. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=81.42s)]
*  That essentially the war has to come to a definitive end in Gaza for them to release [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=85.34s)]
*  to hostages. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=90.42s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is not wanting to make that step. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  He's wanted it to be a ceasefire that allows for Israel, perhaps after some duration of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=93.82000000000001s)]
*  time, to kind of go back in and continue to wage war against Hamas. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=98.9s)]
*  And attached to that, Andrea, is this question of who runs Gaza in the aftermath of a war [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=103.78s)]
*  if it comes to an end? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=109.14s)]
*  Israeli position is a kind of open ended Israeli control over the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=111.3s)]
*  The U.S. position is some form of Arab force behind a Palestinian leadership other than Hamas. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  These are big gaps. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=121.3s)]
*  So this is a hopeful day in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=122.62s)]
*  But I'm not sure it puts us closer to ending the war in Gaza, given the differences that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=125.86s)]
*  remain there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=130.14s)]
*  And Ben, also, Congressman Mike Walz, the national security adviser, coming in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=132.1s)]
*  He credited Donald Trump for the deal, writing on X, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=139.66s)]
*  everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=142.54s)]
*  Well, here's how Jake Sullivan, of course, the current national security adviser, responded [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=145.89999999999998s)]
*  on Morning Joe. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=150.77999999999997s)]
*  I've kept Congressman Walz apprised at every step of the way, including yesterday as we [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=153.77999999999997s)]
*  were closing this out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=158.54s)]
*  I'm glad to see that they're welcoming it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=159.94s)]
*  I would just say that it makes me particularly proud to have achieved this because you know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=162.06s)]
*  you've done a good thing when other people want to take credit for it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  So what do you think about that? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that there is something to the fact that the, you know, that Netanyahu at [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=173.74s)]
*  least knows that the Trump team is coming in and feels strengthened by that in terms [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=178.74s)]
*  of having less pressure for Palestinian rights, for instance? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=184.82s)]
*  I just don't think so, Andrea. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=190.54s)]
*  I mean, I'm open to the possibility, but the reality is, first of all, they didn't end [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  the war in Gaza. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Lebanon was an escalation that we saw in the summer and fall, you know, coincident, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=198.34s)]
*  by the way, to the precursor to our election, was the time of escalation that Netanyahu [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=205.58s)]
*  chose. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=210.86s)]
*  And the reality is that they had achieved a lot of objectives in terms of dismantling [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=212.22s)]
*  Hezbollah leadership, and they had to make a choice about whether they were going to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=216.62s)]
*  kind of go into Lebanon almost in the same way they did to Gaza to try to completely [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  destroy Hezbollah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=225.1s)]
*  And that was frankly a word that they couldn't afford to fight, particularly given what they're [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=227.26s)]
*  doing in Gaza. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=230.18s)]
*  They've been taking losses. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=230.9s)]
*  Netanyahu in his own comments yesterday suggested that they wanted some time to kind of recoup [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=232.06s)]
*  and rearm and to have less of a strain on the IDF. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=236.78s)]
*  So there are a lot of factors, I think, that allowed for him to say, you know, we had the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  short term escalation in Lebanon. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=244.46s)]
*  I don't think anybody ever expected this to be an open-ended war in Lebanon in the same way [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=246.66s)]
*  that we've seen in Gaza. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  And now he's not ending this state of conflict in the region. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=253.06s)]
*  If he did that, I think that might be an indication of him feeling in a stronger position at home [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=257.94s)]
*  politically with Trump coming in. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=264.06s)]
*  But he's not doing that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=265.58s)]
*  He's ending this one theater in Lebanon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=266.42s)]
*  I attribute that to, frankly, the state of his forces, obviously the degradation of Hezbollah's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=269.46s)]
*  forces, the achievement of some objectives, a lot of U.S. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=275.02s)]
*  diplomacy and frankly, a lot of parties in the region, including some that Israel cares about [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=278.26s)]
*  their opinion, places like the Emirates that just kind of want to see this cauldron, you know, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  on a lower flame here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  So I don't I don't think this is a Trump factor here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=292.17999999999995s)]
*  And a lot of this does rest on the ability of the Lebanese army to stand up and create that buffer [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=297.3s)]
*  zone. Certainly the UNIFIL, the UN people have not been able to do that and are under great [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=304.94s)]
*  suspicion from the Israelis anyway, but certainly allowed Hezbollah to rearm and build tunnels [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=309.78000000000003s)]
*  right under their noses. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=314.66s)]
*  So will the Lebanese army be a precursor of Lebanon regaining its sovereignty from Hezbollah now [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=316.06s)]
*  that Hezbollah has been so diminished? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=323.06s)]
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of things to watch here, both in terms of Lebanese politics, in terms of the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=325.62s)]
*  endurance of the ceasefire, Andrew. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=329.62s)]
*  One is just whether or not the Lebanese armed forces, as you said, can kind of take control of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=332.06s)]
*  southern Lebanon alongside these UN forces. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  The reality is Hezbollah is from there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=340.26s)]
*  Right. So in a lot of these villages, a lot of these population centers in southern Lebanon, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=342.3s)]
*  Hezbollah is kind of deeply embedded in the society. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=346.9s)]
*  And the Lebanese armed forces is seen as something of a of a of a foreign force in some ways. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=350.1s)]
*  And so we'll see. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  But I think what we also have learned over the last year, of course, is and this is true even way [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=356.9s)]
*  back when I was in government, Israel has tremendous intelligence. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=361.7s)]
*  And so if they if they see stuff happening there, they see Hezbollah rearming, regrouping, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  recreating command centers and tunnels, they may take a shot and they may be willing, as we've [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=370.54s)]
*  learned, to scuttle the ceasefire if they see something that they don't like there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoR7KnQjjs&t=375.9s)]
