# What's next? Ex-Israeli Prime Minister weighs in on potential ground invasion in Lebanon
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI)
*  Joining us now, former prime minister of Israel Ehud Omer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  I'm glad you could make it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=5.76s)]
*  A lot has happened in the past few days, in the past week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=7.4s)]
*  Is this strategy of might, killing Nasrallah, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=10.96s)]
*  going after the ports in Yemen, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=14.52s)]
*  killing a Hamas leader in Lebanon, et cetera, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=17.0s)]
*  is this strategy of might an effective one? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  First of all, this is a strategy of self-defense. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=24.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the Houthis from Yemen were shooting, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=30.0s)]
*  or the day before yesterday, they were shooting a ballistic missile [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=35.0s)]
*  that was aiming at Tel Aviv. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=38.0s)]
*  And we have to do something about it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=41.0s)]
*  And also the Hezbollah, for almost a year, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=44.0s)]
*  were shooting hundreds of rockets almost every day, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=49.0s)]
*  hundreds of rockets against Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=54.0s)]
*  They forced out 80,000 Israeli citizens [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=57.0s)]
*  from their homes in the north part of the country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=61.0s)]
*  And they were shooting and fighting and attacking [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=64.0s)]
*  from almost every possible direction into the state of Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=69.0s)]
*  So something had to be done. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=74.0s)]
*  I don't think that this is a policy of might [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=76.0s)]
*  or anything of this nature. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=81.0s)]
*  This is fundamentally a policy of self-defense. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=84.0s)]
*  The question is, what's next? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=89.0s)]
*  I mean, what is it that we are trying to achieve now [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=92.0s)]
*  with this kind of operation? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=96.0s)]
*  This is a similar, a different question, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=98.0s)]
*  not the same as the targeting of the leaders [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=100.0s)]
*  or the terrorist organizations. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=103.0s)]
*  I think that they deserved what they got. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=105.0s)]
*  Nasrallah personally was responsible for killing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=109.0s)]
*  thousands of people in Lebanon, in Syria, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=114.0s)]
*  and in Israel over the last 30 years. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=118.0s)]
*  He was a terrorist organization, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=121.0s)]
*  so one that was brutal and very extreme terrorist leaders. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=123.0s)]
*  And there was no way that you could equate us with him [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=130.0s)]
*  or compromise with him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=134.0s)]
*  I think he deserved what he got. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=136.0s)]
*  The other question is, how do we now bring an end to this conflict [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=138.0s)]
*  in a way that will allow us to bring back the Israelis [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=144.0s)]
*  that left their homes to their homes in the north border of Israel? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=148.0s)]
*  And will the Hezbollah agree to pull out completely from the border [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=154.0s)]
*  across the 40-kilometers line of the Awali River? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=161.0s)]
*  I hope that they will do it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=167.0s)]
*  I hope that we will have to use more military force. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=170.0s)]
*  I'm not happy and I'm not anxious to have this kind of operation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=175.0s)]
*  I hope that the efforts Americans are doing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=179.0s)]
*  and the French are doing to bring an end to this with an agreement [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=182.0s)]
*  will be successful and it will not require military operations. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=188.0s)]
*  Let me jump in and ask you another question. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=198.0s)]
*  You call this self-defense, arguably so. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=201.0s)]
*  If self-defense means going into, reaching into Iran, attacking Iran, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=204.0s)]
*  and if Israel believes it would be effective to do so, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=211.0s)]
*  to take out the Ayatollah or somebody in Iran, does Israel do it? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=214.0s)]
*  You know, Cathy, you're a little bit carried away by the impact [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=220.0s)]
*  of some of these recent operations, Pages and the Hockey Talkies [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=227.0s)]
*  and the targeting of Nasrallah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=232.0s)]
*  Don't push it much further, okay? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=237.0s)]
*  Israel is not going to attack the leader of a legitimate leader, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=240.0s)]
*  a legitimate leader of a country which is a member of the United Nations. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=246.0s)]
*  This is not what we do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=250.0s)]
*  We do have to consider how to deal with this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=252.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYC1uzREwdI&t=270.0s)]
