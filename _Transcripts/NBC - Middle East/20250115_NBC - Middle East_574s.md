# 'Core issues' still the same in the Middle East despite Israel-Hamas ceasefire: Ayman
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8)
*  So much change in such a short period of time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=0.0s)]
*  Aiman, I'd ask you that same question. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=2.7s)]
*  It is profoundly different than it was 16 months ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=5.3s)]
*  It's profoundly different than it was when Donald Trump left office. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=9.38s)]
*  It is, and yet still so much is still exactly the same. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=13.34s)]
*  And I hate to be the outlier here, but I will say that the players may change and the dynamics [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=17.3s)]
*  may change, but the truth of the matter is the core issues are still the same. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=23.06s)]
*  You have failed states across the region. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=26.54s)]
*  You have authoritarian governments across the region. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=28.82s)]
*  You still have Israel that wants peace with its neighbors. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=33.22s)]
*  It has peace with some neighbors. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=36.84s)]
*  Those peace treaties don't necessarily translate into like a warm peace. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=38.54s)]
*  They translate more into this kind of like cessation of hostilities. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=42.34s)]
*  I think Egypt and Israel are the perfect example of that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=45.32s)]
*  So there is this sense that things are changing, but at the same time, the root problems of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  the Middle East continue to be the same. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=53.92s)]
*  And so if you're not going to have a paradigm shift in the region to address so many of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=55.62s)]
*  these core issues, the failed states, the authoritarianism, the occupation of the Palestinians, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  the inability of countries to kind of progress economically and kind of bring about democratic [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=65.66s)]
*  change, as long as you don't have political plurality, if you don't have any of these [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=70.74s)]
*  kind of fundamental idealistic changes, the problems that Donald Trump are going to face [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=74.08s)]
*  are going to be the same that he faced, Biden faced, Obama faced with just short-term solutions. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=78.34s)]
*  That is a good point. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=83.52s)]
*  Anybody in the Middle East that wants to shift that paradigm, anybody stepping up to try [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=84.64s)]
*  and stabilize the region? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=88.0s)]
*  Is Saudi Arabia playing a role in that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=89.56s)]
*  The Qataris are obviously trying to play a pretty big role. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=92.32s)]
*  Is there a country or a leader that can come in and try to, again, to stabilize things? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=95.8s)]
*  Well, you know, from an analytical point of view, people are choosing stability over progress. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=101.12s)]
*  I know that may sound a little bit nuanced, but the reality is people, certainly the governments [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  of the Gulf region that say, look, we have to end the war, we have to end the collapsed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=110.42s)]
*  states in Libya, in Sudan, in Somalia, in Syria now, in Yemen, you have to bring these [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=114.5s)]
*  countries to a cessation of violence and then be able to build them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=120.22s)]
*  So I don't think any one country is coming out and saying, hey, we're reformers, we're [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=124.54s)]
*  progressives, we're going to change, we're going to become more pluralistic and more [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=128.22s)]
*  democratic. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=130.78s)]
*  And we're not seeing that also in the so-called one democracy in the Middle East, which is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=131.82s)]
*  Israel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  We're not seeing it move to a more centrist position. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  But we've seen it over the years has become more hardline, more extreme right, more intrinsic [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=138.9s)]
*  in the positions that it takes towards the Palestinians. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=143.34s)]
*  And you now have members of the Israeli government who say they oppose this deal. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  They want to resettle Gaza. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  They want to annex the West Bank. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=151.34s)]
*  And they've got an administration that's coming into power that may be willing to allow that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=153.22s)]
*  annexation to take place. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=157.58s)]
*  You know, I find your expertise in the region fascinating because you were there for the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=159.22s)]
*  Arab Spring. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=163.02s)]
*  You saw this moment of opportunity for the entire region, this moment of real hope that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=164.02s)]
*  things were going to change. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=168.1s)]
*  It didn't go that way. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=169.1s)]
*  And now we're seeing, as you said, a hardening of positions, a hardening of conservatism [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  or extremism or hardline coalitions within these states, even Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=176.46s)]
*  Is that, I mean, is there a path with the hardening that would lead to stabilization? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=184.9s)]
*  I mean, democracy has been not working so well out there anywhere, even in Israel. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=189.66s)]
*  It's having issues. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=194.62s)]
*  So is a hardening of positions and just say, we just want to get along, let us do our thing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=195.66s)]
*  You can do your thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=201.54s)]
*  Is that the future? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=202.54s)]
*  Well, the problem is, I think many leaders come in with this position, certainly in democratic [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  countries like the United States, who come in and take a position that like, hey, I just [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=208.22s)]
*  have to hold this ship for four years. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=211.5s)]
*  I need to make sure that America is not at war in the Middle East for four years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=213.26s)]
*  Or maybe some do want to go to war in the Middle East. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  But the reality is, from our position, from our democracy, as messy as it is, we don't [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=218.26s)]
*  necessarily support democracy in the Middle East. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=223.62s)]
*  We don't necessarily support democratic change in the Middle East. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  We prefer stability. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=229.66s)]
*  And so the end result is that when you get countries that begin their democratic journey, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=230.94s)]
*  it is oftentimes messy. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=235.54s)]
*  We may get leaders that we don't like. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  We just saw what happened in Syria, where the leader of that country is somebody that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=239.1s)]
*  we had a $10 million bounty on their head for a long time. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  So the reality is now we're going to meet with that person. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=246.5s)]
*  Are we going to be willing to let that country develop and evolve its own democratic practices, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=249.9s)]
*  even if at times we may not agree with it every step of the way? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=256.9s)]
*  And I think our track record shows, and certainly those of the region, as we've seen after the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=260.02s)]
*  Arab Spring, we prefer authoritarian governments. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=265.26s)]
*  We prefer what is perceived to be short-term stability for long-term progress and idealism. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=269.14s)]
*  We've learned there are no clean decisions. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=274.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  Let's talk about what's happening within Israel. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  We were just talking with Richard a moment ago about how this has to clear some hurdles [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=280.29999999999995s)]
*  internally, including passing the Security Council and the broader parliament, the Knesset. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=283.46s)]
*  What is the word on Ben Gavir, on Smotrich, about—these are the two far-right leaders [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=291.62s)]
*  within the coalition. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=297.46s)]
*  Are they going to get on board with this? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=298.9s)]
*  Well, it has to pass the cabinet, but not the Knesset. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=301.14s)]
*  At this point, it's looking like the two of them are not going to be on board with this, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=307.42s)]
*  and probably a few others, not just the other ministers from their parties, but I bet one [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=312.14s)]
*  or two Likud ministers may not keep party discipline. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=317.3s)]
*  I do think that Netanyahu will manage to pass this by the cabinet, but there we enter a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=322.42s)]
*  sort of internal Israeli limbo, because listening again now to President Biden's pretty clear [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=328.78s)]
*  declaration that phase two implies an absolute end to this war, declared end to this war, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=336.14000000000004s)]
*  that Israeli soldiers, he said, will withdraw from all populated areas of Gaza. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=343.26000000000005s)]
*  I don't think at this stage that a majority of the Israeli cabinet that has been primed [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=352.38s)]
*  by Prime Minister Netanyahu to believe that Donald Trump was going to come in and let [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=359.02000000000004s)]
*  them do whatever they wanted, annex whatever they wanted, establish a Jewish theocracy [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=363.9s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  That's what they were ready for, many of them, and that's not the reality they're [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  crashing into right now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=374.94s)]
*  So I do think that Netanyahu is going to have to shore up his flanks and make more of a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=376.06s)]
*  political effort if he doesn't want to incur Donald Trump's anger within the first month [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=382.78s)]
*  of his presidency. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  What is the role that Donald Trump has played? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=392.62s)]
*  You have Haaretz, the more liberal news outlet in Israel, the senior, I believe, diplomatic [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=394.54s)]
*  correspondent saying that Donald Trump was basically the reason this happened, that he [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=403.26s)]
*  strong-armed, that he bent Netanyahu's arm backwards and backwards and backwards until [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=408.7s)]
*  he finally came to the table to accept this deal, which again has been a proposal since May. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=413.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=421.74s)]
*  You're referring to Chaim Levinson. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=423.18s)]
*  I don't think he's wrong, but I don't think that's the total picture here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=425.98s)]
*  There's an Israeli tendency to deify Donald Trump, even among the left. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=433.66s)]
*  I think that the mistaken steps here were taken by Netanyahu. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=440.14s)]
*  I think Netanyahu, way back in May, couldn't imagine an end to this war. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=445.26s)]
*  He also spent this month shoring himself up politically. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=451.58s)]
*  He brought another party into his coalition. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=454.62s)]
*  This is going to sound pretty tinny and pretty superficial and pretty uncharitable on my [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  part, because the war during these eight wasted months has brought Israel very significant [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  results, including basically eliminating Hezbollah as a real player, eliminating Hamas as a serious [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=470.46s)]
*  political player. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=478.29999999999995s)]
*  But still, for the Israeli population, the civilian Israeli population, the idea that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=480.38s)]
*  their children died in Army service—it's a conscript army—the six hostages, including [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpT_gx-8Hi8&t=486.7s)]
