# ‘If they want to stop it, they can’: Crowley on Israel’s rejection of 21-day ceasefire deal
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo)
*  Joining me now, Ambassador Alan Penkis, the former Israeli Consul General in New York, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=0.0s)]
*  and former advisor to Israeli Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Shimon Peres, and New York [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=5.76s)]
*  Times diplomatic correspondent Michael Crowley. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=10.6s)]
*  So Michael, this is... they're searching for a fragile, a temporary ceasefire for 21 days [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=13.44s)]
*  or fewer days to try to avoid a ground invasion and try to avoid... they really hope Iran [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=20.04s)]
*  doesn't get into this and the signals from Iran are that they would not get into this, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=27.34s)]
*  but Hezbollah is their proxy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=31.26s)]
*  And you know, Hezbollah has... and as you know, Hezbollah and Israel have been firing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=33.78s)]
*  back and forth since October 7th, October 8th, but this is something very different. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=45.3s)]
*  And Andrea, as Secretary Blinken suggested when he spoke to you, this was the great fear [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=46.3s)]
*  of the Biden administration right when September... October 7th happened. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  So they were very concerned about what would happen in Gaza. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=55.0s)]
*  I think in some ways, the greater concern they had was that this would spread into a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=57.56s)]
*  potentially more destructive war between Israel and Hezbollah and Lebanon. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  And the real concern there is that the dynamics of that war, for reasons we can explain, could [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=66.44s)]
*  draw in both the United States and Iran, and that is a much more dangerous situation even [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=70.92s)]
*  relative to the catastrophe in Gaza. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=76.62s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has said some things that don't sound like he's prepared to hit [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=81.28s)]
*  pause on this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  The administration just wants to hit pause on this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  They want to stop it if they can. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=87.98s)]
*  But we've seen a pattern of the Israeli government saying one thing and U.S. officials saying, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=90.06s)]
*  well, they don't really mean it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=94.44s)]
*  They're telling us something different in private. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  That's happened during the Gaza ceasefire negotiations for months. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=98.04s)]
*  So we're seeing kind of a replay. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=101.66s)]
*  And the question is, will this be the time where finally something does fall into place [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=102.66s)]
*  even though the Israelis don't seem ready to go along with it in their public rhetoric? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  And they do have strong support from the Saudis, from the UAE, the Qataris, the others in the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=111.88s)]
*  region who all are trying to avoid this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=118.36s)]
*  And the other problem is that the West Bank is blowing up. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=120.88s)]
*  So Jordan feels threatened. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=124.24s)]
*  This could be a three-front war with Israel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=126.08s)]
*  It's already... [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=128.12s)]
*  Have they taken... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=129.12s)]
*  Isn't Netanyahu taking on more than they can chew? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=130.12s)]
*  No, that's exactly what he wanted to happen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=131.8s)]
*  This is exactly how he wanted things to transpire. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=134.9s)]
*  This serves a narrative that this was not an isolated Hamas attack on October 7th, by [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=137.88s)]
*  the way, for which he did not, to this day, take responsibility or is willing to be held [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=143.56s)]
*  accountable. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  Let me just update this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  As he landed in New York, he said, we're continuing to fight Hezbollah with full force until we [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=151.12s)]
*  reach our goals. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=156.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=157.72s)]
*  No one knows what those goals are. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=158.72s)]
*  But he needs to validate this narrative that he developed, that this is a 360-degree war, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=160.96s)]
*  that there's an epicenter of an axis of anarchy and terrorism in Iran, and it's employing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=168.72s)]
*  all these proxies, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Israel is right in between. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  So get off my back, Mr. Biden, and the world should understand this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, what those goals in Lebanon are is not clear, because we're going to go back. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=186.4s)]
*  I mean, Michael here said correctly that this is a replay of what happened in Gaza, but [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=191.92s)]
*  this is a replay of our back and forth, this ping pong with Hezbollah for the last 25 years. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=196.88s)]
*  And the invasion in 2006, which was devastating to Lebanon and hurt Israel as well. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=203.72s)]
*  And I remember in 1982, which was another invasion of Lebanon. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  Michael, this is happening with less than six weeks before an election. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=214.92s)]
*  And now you've got two wars. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=220.6s)]
*  Today, the Zelensky meeting at the White House, Donald Trump criticizing Zelensky, praising [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  This is a total mess for the administration. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  This was supposed to be the sort of victory lap for Joe Biden this week at the UN. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  You put your finger on it, Andrea. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=238.44s)]
*  And I think President Biden was hoping to come here, give a kind of valedictory speech, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=239.83999999999997s)]
*  talk about the accomplishments of his foreign policy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=244.12s)]
*  And there are some good things you can point to, but on the big categorical things like [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  the war in Ukraine, like the Middle East, the trend lines are not in the right direction. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=250.44000000000003s)]
*  And it's just not the sendoff that President Biden was hoping for in front of this global audience. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, there's still time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  And if they could clinch some kind of a deal and get these larger agreements moving forward, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=266.22s)]
*  like the idea to get a normalization agreement between the Saudis and the Israelis, that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=272.16s)]
*  could be a great feather in President Biden's cap for his legacy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=277.36s)]
*  But I think the odds for that at this point are dwindling close to zero. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeJwVbkQqJo&t=280.32s)]
