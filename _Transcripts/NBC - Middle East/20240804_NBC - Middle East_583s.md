# Rep Seth. Moulton: ‘The stakes are higher here in terms of Israeli citizens on the line’
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM)
*  Joining me now, Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, Seth Moulton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=0.0s)]
*  He is a member of the Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=3.36s)]
*  Always good to see you, my friend. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=6.2s)]
*  Let me ask you quickly to respond to what John Kirby said, the fact that we don't know [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=7.2s)]
*  what they're going to do. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=10.8s)]
*  What's the status of intelligence on that kind of thing? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=13.24s)]
*  No, we don't know exactly what's going to happen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=16.48s)]
*  Of course, Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=19.96s)]
*  I mean, let's start there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=21.92s)]
*  Israeli citizens are under threat. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=23.96s)]
*  A bunch of Israeli children, about 12 children, were killed in a recent rocket attack. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=26.0s)]
*  So Israel has to defend itself. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=31.48s)]
*  But this is an issue that could well involve us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  And we do not want to get dragged into another war in the Middle East. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=38.22s)]
*  That's why we have a stake in exactly what Israel does do to defend itself. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=42.08s)]
*  We want Israel to be safe. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=46.24s)]
*  We want Israelis to be safe. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=47.44s)]
*  But we also don't want a wider war in the Middle East. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=49.28s)]
*  John, look, let's review April, because that's when Israel and its allies, and that includes [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=53.6s)]
*  the U.S., we were able to help shoot down roughly, what, 300 or so Iranian missiles [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  and drones that were fired at Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=62.56s)]
*  But this time, is the expectation different? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  Are you concerned about a major escalation? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=67.4s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=69.88s)]
*  I mean, Hezbollah in the north has thousands and thousands of rockets, many times what [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=71.76s)]
*  we've seen in Gaza, many times what we saw even Iran shoot at Israel in its unprecedented [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=77.36s)]
*  attack. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=82.76s)]
*  So the stakes are higher here in terms of Israeli citizens on the line and how many [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  could die in a full on assault by Hezbollah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=88.76s)]
*  Of course, if that's coupled with further escalation with Iran, it could be enough missiles [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=92.28s)]
*  and drones to simply overwhelm the Israeli defense systems, even with our help. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=97.48s)]
*  Now, we're rushing more carriers and other ships to the region in order to provide more [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=101.48s)]
*  defense, to try to tamp this down. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=107.72s)]
*  Every rocket that hits and kills civilians inspires that other side to respond. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=112.12s)]
*  And this thing quickly escalates out of control. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=118.12s)]
*  The U.S. mission right now is to prevent that escalation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=120.84s)]
*  Yes, we want Israel to be safe, but we need to prevent an escalation that could result [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=124.28s)]
*  in a wider Middle Eastern war, ultimately involve U.S. troops. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=129.24s)]
*  We had troops there for 20 years, and our focus right now needs to be preventing a war [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=132.12s)]
*  with China in the Pacific not getting dragged into another major conflict in the Middle [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=137.08s)]
*  East. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=141.64s)]
*  Let me ask you, and it's a bit putting you on the spot, but is there a red line at which [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=142.84s)]
*  you think if it is crossed, that's when we see U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=146.92s)]
*  military involvement? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=151.16s)]
*  Look, I think we've learned our lesson about red lines and in such a complex situation [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=152.92s)]
*  right now with multiple actors, you've got Iran threatening Israel directly, but also [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=158.6s)]
*  supporting actors like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=164.04s)]
*  You've got the Houthis attacking international shipping in the Red Sea. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  You have Hezbollah threatening more attacks to kill Israeli citizens from the North. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  Such a complex situation, you don't want to draw specific red lines. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=176.92s)]
*  But what everyone in the Middle East needs to understand is that the U.S. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=180.6s)]
*  means business when it's sending more forces in the region. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=184.12s)]
*  And our mission is not to start a war, it's to tamp one down, to prevent escalation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=187.0s)]
*  That's the message that's got to come through strong and clear from the United States right [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=192.28s)]
*  now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=196.84s)]
*  So concern about a ceasefire. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=198.28s)]
*  U.S. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  National Security spokesman John Kirby, he said this morning a ceasefire deal is still possible. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=201.24s)]
*  But is there reason for concern about it? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=207.64s)]
*  Does all of this raise questions, these assassinations this week, does it raise questions [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=210.04s)]
*  about whether Netanyahu is serious about a ceasefire? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=214.36s)]
*  Well, look, I think everybody has questions. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=219.08s)]
*  The ceasefire deal has essentially been on the table for a couple months now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=221.24s)]
*  And I think that these continued sort of tit for tat makes it difficult for Netanyahu or anyone [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  else to sit down at the negotiating table and actually ink a deal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=232.44s)]
*  I was personally thrilled to see some of these Hamas leaders killed in recent days. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=237.24s)]
*  These are leaders who are responsible for the deaths of really thousands of innocent civilians. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=242.12s)]
*  And they've been brought to justice. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=247.56s)]
*  But of course, some of these people are the same folks who've been involved in these [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=249.48s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  So this makes everything much more complicated. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  You usually have a ceasefire deal when there's more of a status quo, not the real potential [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=256.2s)]
*  for escalation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=261.56s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we want to ceasefire because it will stop innocent civilians from [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=262.36s)]
*  being killed on both sides of this conflict and finally bring an end game into into clearer view. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=266.52s)]
*  I want to pick up on the words both sides because the prisoner swap last week, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=274.2s)]
*  it was a major win for President Biden's diplomacy skills. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=279.0s)]
*  I mean, a feat to get journalists and dissidents out of Russian prisons. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=282.04s)]
*  But Senator Lindsey Graham is raising concerns this morning that trading them for assassins [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=285.8s)]
*  just rewards Putin. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=290.76s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=291.8s)]
*  The more thugs like Putin get rewarded for doing bad things, the more bad things you will get. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=294.44s)]
*  So I'm worried that the Iranians and the Chinese are watching, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=301.32s)]
*  making all of our enemies more provocative, not less. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=304.84s)]
*  Your thoughts on that and what can be done about the Americans that are still in detention in Russia? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=309.0s)]
*  I mean, Alex, first of all, if Joe Biden climbed up a tree to save Lindsey Graham's cat, Lindsey [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=316.44s)]
*  Graham would find a reason to criticize Joe Biden. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=322.2s)]
*  So you can't take what Lindsey Graham says all that seriously these days. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=324.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, the reality is that this was a masterstroke of diplomacy, diplomacy that took [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=328.6s)]
*  months and required extensive relationship, really deep relationships with our friends and allies, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=334.52s)]
*  and also dialogue with our adversaries. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=340.68s)]
*  Those are two really important components of this deal to understand. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=345.08s)]
*  Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, who had to make a big compromise to allow this deal to go [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  through by releasing this German prisoner, said that he did it as a personal favor to Biden because [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  he trusts Joe Biden because of the relationship they've developed over years, a trusting relationship. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=360.52s)]
*  At the same time, the CIA had to have direct conversations with their Russian counterparts [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  at the same time as we're engaged in almost a shadow war here over Ukraine. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=372.28s)]
*  So this all explains the importance of incredible diplomacy that's really been a hallmark of the Biden administration. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  There have been things about Biden foreign policy, like the withdrawal from Afghanistan, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=386.68s)]
*  that I haven't been afraid to criticize myself as a Democrat. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=390.44s)]
*  But the diplomacy has really been extraordinary. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=394.04s)]
*  The same kind of remarkable diplomacy that put together the coalition to stand up for Ukraine [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=396.52s)]
*  has now been on display in bringing home these innocent Americans and other Russian dissidents, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=401.16s)]
*  saving them from the fate of Alexei Navalny dying in a Russian prison colony. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=405.96s)]
*  So I think this points not only to a great success achieved because of Joe Biden's personal relationships, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=411.64s)]
*  but also just to the broader importance of diplomacy, which is in stark contrast to what we hear [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=418.76s)]
*  from the Trump-Vance team, who want to alienate our allies and present a really uncertain picture [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=423.47999999999996s)]
*  to our enemies. So you can't have these kinds of conversations that save innocent lives. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we're all looking ahead to Tuesday, Philadelphia, the rally that will have the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  Democratic ticket there out in public. You have Governor's Wal Shapiro meeting with [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=439.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris today, as well as Senator Kelly. Is there one that jumps out at you that you think [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  that's the ringer? No, I think as I've said for a while, there's a great, deep Democratic bench [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  that we haven't seen for a while. But now we're seeing three of those members, some of the best [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=456.92s)]
*  members of the bench on display for the American public. They're all great. I know Mark Kelly and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=463.16s)]
*  Tim Walz very well from service in Congress. I've heard wonderful things about Governor Shapiro. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=469.48s)]
*  Any one of them would bring strength to this ticket, and any one of them would present a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=475.16s)]
*  very stark contrast with J.D. Vance, who has had one of the most crazy odd rollouts of any politician, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  I think, in history with his debut as a vice presidential candidate. The only thing he can [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=486.68s)]
*  say about J.D. Vance is that he fits in well with Trump. He's a Trump loyalist. He does whatever [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=491.64s)]
*  Trump says, and that presents a really uncertain picture to our allies and adversaries around the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  world, let alone to the American people. I mean, does J.D. Vance believe in women and support women [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=501.08s)]
*  or just attack them? We don't know. Does he support our allies around the world or does he not? He [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=506.28s)]
*  says he supports Ukraine one moment, then he doesn't the next. He says he praises Obama. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=512.84s)]
*  Now he hates Obama. He says he hates Trump repeated times. Trump is an enemy to democracy, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=517.56s)]
*  all these terrible things. And now all of a sudden, now Trump can do nothing wrong. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=523.7199999999999s)]
*  We fundamentally don't know where J.D. Vance even stands. So people don't even know if they agree [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IkPfSHxLM&t=527.4s)]
