# Trump ‘knows Hesgeth’s a buffoon’ but wants to ‘exert his will’ on Senate: Lincoln Project advisor
**NBC - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw)
*  When you look, Kayla, at what is happening right now, talk about how President Joe Biden, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=0.0s)]
*  whom you cover and have covered for the last number of years while he's been in the White [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=5.72s)]
*  House, how must he be feeling about all of this and the incredible effort that he, his [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=9.22s)]
*  administration, the secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, also Brett McGurk, the Middle East [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=17.16s)]
*  envoy, trying to negotiate what we're seeing come to fruition. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=23.48s)]
*  It's happening less than 24 hours before he leaves office. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=28.8s)]
*  Talk about what went into getting to this point. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=34.28s)]
*  Well, Alex, I can tell you that this is something that the Biden administration absolutely wanted [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=37.56s)]
*  to do before President Biden left office. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=44.44s)]
*  It has really been months in the making since we saw Biden initially announce this framework [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=47.44s)]
*  that we're seeing implemented now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  But something that is really complicated for him right now is because Donald Trump, of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=54.8s)]
*  course, has taken credit for seeing this deal come together. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=58.8s)]
*  And I think my colleagues in the Middle East have really said that it was his warnings that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=62.08s)]
*  really upped the pressure and the urgency to get this deal done, because, of course, he [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  has reiterated multiple times that there would be hell to pay for Hamas if hostages were not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=70.96s)]
*  released by the time he took office on January 20th. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=76.32s)]
*  So there's really complicated legacy here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  It's really something that he wanted to burnish his policy legacy here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=81.96s)]
*  And yet Donald Trump still overshadowing him in this moment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, let's go back to you, Ross, because we also see more activity. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=91.24s)]
*  What's happening there behind you? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=95.6s)]
*  Have they just gone by you? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Any of the hostages? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=98.52s)]
*  Alex, you are just seeing the tail ends of a convoy of those large white vans and Israeli [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=99.72s)]
*  security vehicles coming past. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  And we believe that all three of those hostages were in that big white van that they came off [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=109.8s)]
*  the helipad. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=115.04s)]
*  They drove past us here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=116.0s)]
*  There was a big cry cheering from the crowd here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=117.36s)]
*  It was all just a couple of seconds and they were passed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=121.92s)]
*  You can imagine a lot of thought has gone into the logistics, into the medical protocols. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=124.8s)]
*  But we believe that at this moment, behind those plastic screens, the hostages are stepping [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=130.48s)]
*  out of that van. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=137.2s)]
*  They are walking into the main lobby of Sheba Hospital. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=138.16s)]
*  And this is likely to be their home for the foreseeable. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=141.84s)]
*  This is going to be a long, long journey of recovery for them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  But we think right now they are meeting the medical teams who are going to take care of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=150.68s)]
*  them as they begin to recover. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=154.68s)]
*  Alex. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=156.88s)]
*  Well, that is a joyful thing, boy, I tell you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=157.4s)]
*  It's such relief. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=160.48s)]
*  And with their mothers by their side, it is extraordinary. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=161.28s)]
*  I do want to bring in Stuart Stevens as well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=165.24s)]
*  Stuart, I'm curious, when you look at this big picture, all that is happening on this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=169.24s)]
*  pivotal day, which will be followed tomorrow by yet another pivotal day as we move officially [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=173.72s)]
*  from one administration to the next, you see hostages being released as a result of 15 [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=178.68s)]
*  months of efforts on behalf of the Biden administration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=184.28s)]
*  And then in the last couple of weeks, the addition of Steve Wittkopf, the Middle East [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=187.32s)]
*  envoy there for the incoming Trump administration, you see that and you see the incoming commander [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=192.44000000000003s)]
*  in chief as well at Arlington laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  Big picture. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=203.8s)]
*  What is going through your mind on this extraordinary day? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that what we saw at Arlington is in the best American tradition. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=210.68s)]
*  I'm for these normalization of all of this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=216.12s)]
*  We should have everything should be normal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=219.8s)]
*  This is president is a temporary position. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=223.24s)]
*  You are there as a custodian, the legacy of what it means to be American. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=226.84s)]
*  So Donald Trump has said horrible things about America's military. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, going back to when he said that John McCain was not a hero. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=237.08s)]
*  So a moment like this, it doesn't undo that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=240.84s)]
*  But I think it's positive that he's doing it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=245.4s)]
*  And I can't help but think looking at these hostages, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=248.28000000000003s)]
*  the horror that they have been through. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=251.48s)]
*  I have to think about how disgraceful it was is that Donald Trump refers to the criminals [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=254.67999999999998s)]
*  who were arrested in January 6th as hostages. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=261.4s)]
*  There is just no comparison whatsoever. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=265.08s)]
*  And yeah, everybody wants to hope that Donald Trump is going to be a successful president. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=268.28s)]
*  There's nothing to be gained if he's not. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=274.52s)]
*  But if you look at some of these nominees, like Pete Hedzik, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=277.16s)]
*  the idea that he's a veteran, great. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  But there's a lot of veterans who are much more qualified. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=284.36s)]
*  And I personally believe that Trump nominates someone like Hedzik. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=287.88s)]
*  I think he knows that he's a buffoon. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=291.64s)]
*  But he wants to prove that he can exert his will over these senators, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=293.72s)]
*  many of whom he knows have great doubts about him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=298.68s)]
*  So there's sort of a humiliation to subservience going on here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=302.36s)]
*  And it's a very autocratic process to do that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=306.6s)]
*  And I wish that the Republican senators had stood up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=311.24s)]
*  I wish that Senator Wicker, my former Mississippi client, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=315.56s)]
*  had insisted that Donald Trump appoint someone who's a competent conservative, who has a history. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't think that Roger Wicker would let Pete Hedzik cut his lawn. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=327.8s)]
*  I mean, this guy shows up, tattoos, drinks on the job, has this history with women. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=331.16s)]
*  You're not going to let that guy into your house. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=335.88s)]
*  And yet here he is going to be in this tremendously powerful position. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  And this is just all so unnecessary. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=341.48s)]
*  And it goes to the sort of flaw of Donald Trump's character, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  that he has to use public policy, being in the White House, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  to work through these personal issues, retribution. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=354.92s)]
*  What sort of theme is that to enter a presidency? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=358.68s)]
*  And yet, Stuart, despite everything I've heard, and there'll be many, many people who agree with you, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=361.56s)]
*  I will describe myself as a glass half full kind of girl, until proven that it's actually half empty. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=367.96s)]
*  So are you thinking, perhaps, unlike our former guest and good friend, Congressman Jake Auchincloss, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=375.23999999999995s)]
*  who I'm sure had to leave, although he was with us extended for our coverage [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=382.76s)]
*  of the delayed ceremony in Arlington at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=386.2s)]
*  he said he does not expect Donald Trump to change at all. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  And yet, with every new administration, there is the hope for change. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump has the capacity to, with his advisors, with people around him, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  to unify this country in a more positive way going forward? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't think Donald Trump can change. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, look, if you had a friend, a female friend who was marrying a 78-year-old guy, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=414.76s)]
*  and she said, you know, there's a lot of things I don't like about him, but he promises to change. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=421.56s)]
*  What would you tell that friend? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=426.44s)]
*  You'd say, you'd better like what you're getting, because 78-year-old men don't change. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=429.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump's character and personality has been in display for decades. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=432.84s)]
*  Now, you want to hope for the best for the country? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=441.4s)]
*  You want to hope that Marco Rubio, who I think is a very, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=446.04s)]
*  is going to be nominated or confirmed with bipartisan support? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  There could have been more nominees like him, and there are a couple more. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=454.12s)]
*  You hope that he's a great secretary of state. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=458.12s)]
*  You hope at the end of the day that Donald Trump would be seen as a great president. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=460.76s)]
*  I mean, I felt this way. I worked for Mitt Romney when Barack Obama was elected. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=465.64000000000004s)]
*  I thought you should believe this is American, but it doesn't mean that you have to suspend [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  disbelief and suspend knowledge of what you know about Donald Trump. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=477.4s)]
*  And it shouldn't hesitate, no one should be hesitant to criticize Donald Trump. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=482.11999999999995s)]
*  Well, we've certainly heard a lot of that. I want to thank you both. I know we had planned [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=487.64s)]
*  to talk on a number of issues, but thank you so much for helping us through this breaking news [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=491.96s)]
*  on this quite extraordinary day, both of you, Akaila and Stuart. Thank you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO2vbHTsBFw&t=495.71999999999997s)]
