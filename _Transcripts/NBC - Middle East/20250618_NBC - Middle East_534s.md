# Trump on Iran: ‘The next week is going to be very big’
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o)
*  Let's bring in NBC News White House correspondent Monica Alba and senior national security correspondent Courtney QB, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=0.0s)]
*  where Secretary Hegseth is testifying this morning on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=6.8s)]
*  Also with us, New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker and NBC military analyst retired four-star general Barry McCaffrey. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=10.48s)]
*  Monica, what do we know about the military options being discussed right now by Trump's national security team? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=19.04s)]
*  Well, we know that there was a lengthy meeting yesterday in the situation room on with the president and his top national security advisors, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=25.6s)]
*  where he was presented with and they discussed a range of options. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=32.0s)]
*  And this would include everything from continuing to do what the U.S. is doing now, which is to provide Israel with this defense support as they continue to intercept missiles and drones from Iran or go on the offensive and try to join Israel in providing some kind of military support with strikes in Iran, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=35.88s)]
*  specifically targeting those outstanding nuclear facilities. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=55.24s)]
*  And that is something, of course, that the president was maybe hinting at with some of his social media posts yesterday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  And then there's another option, which is a combination of helping Israeli jets potentially to refuel or from other supportive positioning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=64.72s)]
*  And there's also the option, the president says, of, again, doing nothing at all. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=74.28s)]
*  And that is what he just spoke to in this lengthy Q&A with reporters on the South Lawn, where he said, quote, I may do it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=78.72s)]
*  I may not. When he was asked if he had made a decision coming out of that meeting. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=86.08s)]
*  So he really was joking in a sense by saying, do you think I would tell you and do you think I would tell you at what time we plan to bomb Iran? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  If that's what we ended up deciding ultimately to do. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=98.64s)]
*  So he didn't want to get into any of the specifics, but he did reveal a little bit of new information that requires some more reporting on, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=101.24s)]
*  which is that he says the Iranians have reached out to him directly to the White House and that some offered some officials to come to the White House, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=109.08s)]
*  to come to Washington, to perhaps continue some conversations. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=118.08s)]
*  It's unclear exactly what he meant by that, but it kind of bolsters this idea that he's been trying to present that he thought there was still a potential path for a diplomatic [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=121.88s)]
*  solution here. But at the same time, the president also just told reporters that that call or that outreach from the Iranians is very different now than it was a week ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=130.96s)]
*  He continues to say that had this been a week ago or had they tried to take the deal or be more of a player returning to the table in these negotiations to curb Iran's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=140.88s)]
*  nuclear capabilities, that maybe some sort of outcome could be reached. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  But he's saying short of that now with the fire that's been exchanged between Israel and Iran over the last five or six days, that that seems less likely. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=154.08s)]
*  And then he went into a lot of other tangents about the Fed chair, about immigration and about what he's out there to do, which is to witness this installation of a new flagpole that's going to be going on the South Lawn and on the North Lawn. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  And he indicated he might be taking more questions later when they actually are going to raise the flag up there on it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=173.68s)]
*  OK, let's focus back on Iran here now. General McCaffrey. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=180.0s)]
*  One reason for potential U.S. involvement is to hit Iran's deep underground nuclear facility with a bunker buster, a capability that, as I understand it, only the U.S. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=183.44s)]
*  really has. Talk to us about that and what that could entail. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=192.84s)]
*  Well, the U.S. does have a 30,000 pound targeted munition deep penetration. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=198.32s)]
*  It probably could get down to the 300 foot deep Fordham nuclear site. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  It'd be repetitive strikes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=214.12s)]
*  It would probably also entail a widespread attack by U.S. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=216.0s)]
*  fighter aircraft to further suppress air defenses and possibly other nuclear targets. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=220.0s)]
*  If you're a Revolutionary Guard lieutenant colonel right now, you think Iran's really been knocked to its knees. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=227.52s)]
*  The IDF has struck throughout the country. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=234.2s)]
*  They have devastated Iran's offensive capability to fire missiles at Israel, although Israel has taken some hits. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=238.2s)]
*  Russia isn't going to intervene on their path, behalf. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=247.44s)]
*  Their proxies are devastated. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=251.92s)]
*  The Houthis, Hezbollah, the Syrian regime's knocked out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=253.8s)]
*  So they're in trouble. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=257.76s)]
*  I think a lot of this is just a mugging of Iran in public to try and force them to negotiate. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=259.20000000000005s)]
*  May or may not work. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  President's language is simply outrageous, unconditional surrender. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=268.68s)]
*  1945, who do they surrender to? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Us. We might assassinate the Ayatollah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=277.32000000000005s)]
*  A lot of it, I think, does add pressure on the Iranians, but it's a bizarre situation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=282.72s)]
*  And we're seeing these sort of dramatic pictures inside Iran from recent attacks just in the last 24 hours. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=290.08s)]
*  There are lots of fire, lots of smoke. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's say the U.S. does take this military action general if they drop this 30,000 pound bomb. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=298.88s)]
*  Could it be a one and done attack for the U.S.? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=305.8s)]
*  Or is it just never going to be that simple? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=308.4s)]
*  I would not think that we would send a lone B-2 bomber in. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=310.76s)]
*  By the way, we've got exquisite intelligence on the center ground facility. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=316.56s)]
*  The five giant tunnels. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=321.2s)]
*  We know where the air ventilation shafts are. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=322.84s)]
*  The entrances are. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  You'd probably have to drop a series of these 30,000 pound weapons one after another in the same strike point. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=326.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, until the Iranians decide to end a nuclear program that's been going for over two decades, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=335.68s)]
*  they're really all we can do is pause the whole action. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=345.24s)]
*  And of course, there's the you know, when you elect war as your choice, it may be a smart decision at the time. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=348.68s)]
*  The question then becomes, where is it all going? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=354.76s)]
*  I think the U.S. entering the war on with an air attack at this point will have unintended consequences. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=357.68s)]
*  The Iranians for sure will then close the Persian Gulf. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=366.88s)]
*  For sure, they will attack U.S. facilities. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=371.8s)]
*  So, you know, I think we're watching a lot of U.S. air power flow into the region, into Saudi Arabia, into Italy, into the UK. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=375.48s)]
*  The Navy's got another carrier battle group headed that way. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=383.68s)]
*  It's a very credible capability now to devastate Iran even further. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=386.72s)]
*  Courtney, you're there on the Hill monitoring this hearing with the defense secretary in front of the House or rather Senate Armed Services Committee. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=393.68s)]
*  Has he addressed the White House's thinking on a potential Iran strike? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=400.56s)]
*  Not really, although, I mean, candidly, I've been standing here for a bit, so I've missed the last several minutes. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=405.04s)]
*  But before we went on the air here, he had not addressed it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=409.24s)]
*  Look, the reality is, Ana, we expect him to get questions about it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  And the big question is, as Monica and General McCaffrey have laid out, is will the U.S. military get involved? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=414.64s)]
*  So at this point, we don't have an answer to that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=421.88s)]
*  It's not just what could the U.S. do. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=426.4s)]
*  General McCaffrey laid it out very well there, the possibility of the U.S. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=428.2s)]
*  is in one of these what are called a bunker buster, you know, or a massive ordnance penetrator, a mop to penetrate deep into the nuclear facility at Fordow and potentially even at other locations as well. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=430.88s)]
*  But the real question here is when could the United States get involved? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=443.48s)]
*  The Israelis have proven that they have a pretty substantial capability. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=447.2s)]
*  They have shown now on several different occasions the ability to conduct airstrikes deep inside Iran. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=450.76s)]
*  Several days ago, they already proclaimed that they had they had captured the airspace or they had superiority of the airspace over Tehran. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=456.6s)]
*  So the question is, what is the capability that the United States military really needs to bring here? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=464.64s)]
*  And as General McCaffrey said, the one thing they don't have is this giant bomb. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  Fordow is buried about 300 feet below the surface. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=473.12s)]
*  The G.B.U. 57, what we've been calling the bunker buster, it has the capability of going at least 200 feet deep. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=476.2s)]
*  And critically, it's only about fifty five hundred six thousand pounds worth of actual explosives. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  But it is because the total weight of it, the thirty thousand pounds, is actually this very thick, very thick penetra strong alloy that's able to penetrate deep into the ground [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=486.32s)]
*  without allowing the explosives to detonate. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. is the only one who not only has the ability to or has the bomb itself, but has the ability to employ it with these B-2 bombers. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=500.8s)]
*  The question is, is there anything else the Israelis need in addition to that? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=508.36s)]
*  We don't have the answer yet, Yana. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2SIO3JZ1o&t=512.44s)]
