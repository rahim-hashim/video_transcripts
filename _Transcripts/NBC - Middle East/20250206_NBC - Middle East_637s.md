# White House clarifies Trump's plan to 'take over' Gaza
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y)
*  House is attempting this morning to clarify President Trump's proposal for the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  States to take over Gaza. On Tuesday, the president announced the U.S. should own the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=4.72s)]
*  enclave, redevelop it, and reallocate, relocate two million Palestinians who live there to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=10.08s)]
*  either Egypt or Jordan. Those two countries have said they are not willing to do that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=16.1s)]
*  He also suggested American troops could be deployed to Gaza to carry out that plan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=20.64s)]
*  Comments, of course, sparked international backlash, especially from Arab countries. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=25.6s)]
*  Now the White House appears to be walking back part of the president's proposal while [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=30.12s)]
*  defending his idea. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=34.56s)]
*  The president has not committed to putting boots on the ground in Gaza. He has also said [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  that the United States is not going to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. His administration [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=41.96s)]
*  is going to work with our partners in the region to reconstruct this region. And let [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=46.42s)]
*  me just take a step back here because this is an out of the box idea. That's who President [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=51.92s)]
*  Trump is. That's why the American people elected him. And his goal is lasting peace in the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  Middle East for all people in the region. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  What President Trump announced yesterday is the offer, the willingness of the United States [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=66.88s)]
*  to become responsible for the reconstruction of that area. It was not meant as a hostile [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=72.16s)]
*  move. It was meant as, I think, a very generous move, the offer to rebuild and to be in charge [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=77.16s)]
*  of the rebuilding of a place, many parts of which right now, even if people move back, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=82.24s)]
*  they would have nowhere to live safely because there are still unexploded munitions and debris [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  and rubble. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=90.84s)]
*  The definition of insanity is attempting to do the same thing over and over and over again. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=92.84s)]
*  And as the president and prime minister pointed out last night, the president is willing to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=97.32s)]
*  think outside the box, look for new and unique, dynamic ways to solve problems that have felt [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=102.78s)]
*  like they're intractable. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=108.94s)]
*  Joe, interesting to hear from Defense Secretary Hegseth and Secretary of State Rubio there [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=110.58s)]
*  because it's reported this morning in the New York Times that President Trump did not [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  consult either the Department of Defense or the Department of State before making this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=119.78s)]
*  announcement in an open press availability with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. So [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  again, what we're seeing is Donald Trump throwing out a radical idea, his staff scrambling [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=129.66s)]
*  in behind him, and really the whole of the American government scrambling behind him [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=134.06s)]
*  to make sense of it or to explain it away. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=137.7s)]
*  Well, you know, and that really is, and I've been saying this for months now, I've been [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=139.9s)]
*  talking about the need to separate the signal from the ground noise. And when he said this, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=144.74s)]
*  so many people sort of laughed, rolled their eyes, and now he's just saying it, maybe sometimes [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=150.98s)]
*  he does that to distract from something else that's going on. Maybe it's Elon Musk ripping [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=156.08s)]
*  through the federal government and trying to get access to things he doesn't have the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=161.28s)]
*  legal right to get access to. Or maybe it is, just as we've said about the tariffs from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=166.72s)]
*  the beginning, maybe it is the opening bit of something, presents something so shocking [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=172.2s)]
*  that other countries have to reset in the way they negotiate. And that is the way he [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=177.88s)]
*  works, David Ignatius. And even though many of our allies and fewer of our enemies understand [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=185.4s)]
*  that, I know I spoke with people in the region over the past couple of days, and even if [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=193.92s)]
*  it was an opening bid, even if a day after, everybody's saying, OK, well, they seem to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=199.0s)]
*  be backing off. Talk about your reporting and how our allies were deeply shaken by this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=205.28s)]
*  Our enemies were thrilled by this because what propaganda for Iran, what propaganda for [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  Hamas, what propaganda for our enemies that the imperialist America now wants to come [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=222.24s)]
*  over. But talk about it, because when we say Arab countries were upset, that used to be [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=227.84s)]
*  our enemies are upset. Now those Arab countries, those Sunni Arab countries, our close allies, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=234.44s)]
*  they were deeply shaken by this. And even the DHS had to send out, as you reported, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=241.24s)]
*  a chilling warning about the possibility of terror strikes as a result of this change [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=246.72s)]
*  in posture. So, Joe, like Trump's tariff policies, what was shocking about this was that it was [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  assault on our closest friends and allies, Jordan and Egypt, which are the two countries [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=263.44s)]
*  that matter most in terms of the security of Israel. When the proposal was made, the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=270.04s)]
*  reaction in the Arab world was immediate. People were on the phone. I'm told that Mohammed [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, was talking yesterday to King Abdullah in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=279.6s)]
*  Jordan, offering him assurance that Donald Trump is not going to roll us into supporting [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=284.8s)]
*  this proposal. By midday, the reaction was so strong that you could see Trump, through [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=290.4s)]
*  the White House spokesman, backing away from some details of the plan. This had been announced [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=297.44s)]
*  as a takeover. We're going to take Gaza. We're going to take it with troops. But by midday, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=303.0s)]
*  no, no boots on the ground. The reality is that this is a crazy proposal. The idea that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=308.12s)]
*  the United States would take over property in the most explosive, war-prone part of the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  world and that a president who said, I'm going to end Middle East wars, would be championing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  it, it just makes your head spin. It's likely that this isn't going anywhere. Is it the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=325.92s)]
*  opening bid? The opening bid to what? The truth is, a solution for Gaza, the president's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=333.4s)]
*  right. Gaza looks like a demolition zone. I've seen it with my own eyes. Every building [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=339.64s)]
*  you see in every direction has been destroyed. What's going to be done? If Trump's idea [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=343.92s)]
*  is a bad one, what's a good one? There are lots of ideas out there. The Israelis have [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=348.52s)]
*  been resisting, many of the ones the U.S. has proposed. If this is the opening of a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=354.0s)]
*  real discussion about how you rebuild Gaza, so much the better. But Trump's initial version [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=359.0s)]
*  of this was so disorienting for the region that it got a big pushback and I do think [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=365.4s)]
*  is going to be a fodder for terror groups that would like to inspire radical action [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=372.4s)]
*  in the United States. I did quote this morning a memo that was sent out in the early hours [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=378.8s)]
*  of yesterday morning by DHS noting the likelihood that there would be protest demonstrations [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=384.04s)]
*  around the country and that if they turn violent, people would have to deal with that. So I [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=391.12s)]
*  think already there's a sense that this may be triggering precisely the kind of threat [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  within the homeland that we shouldn't be wanting. So David, let me ask you, if this was an attempt [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  to throw everybody off balance and set up an opening bid for something different, because [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  as the Wall Street Journal editorial page said, going back to the status quo with Hamas [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=415.04s)]
*  in charge certainly is not an option. That was this morning's Wall Street Journal editorial, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  lead editorial. So what is this an opening bid for? Is this an opening perhaps the Saudis, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=425.8s)]
*  the Emiratis, the Jordanians, other people in the region coming in with an Arab peacekeeping [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=432.8s)]
*  force? What could this be an opening bid to? What could, do you have any reporting on what [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=438.56s)]
*  Donald Trump was trying to get to? So Donald Trump's vision, and this does go back many [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=445.44s)]
*  months and maybe even years, I had one senior official say this is the deal of the century [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=454.04s)]
*  coming back. We're going back to Trump's first term and let's just turn over everything and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=460.6s)]
*  start again with American leadership. So maybe there are echoes of that. Certainly Jared [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=466.96s)]
*  Kushner, his son-in-law, was talking a year ago, you can see him on tape at a Harvard [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=471.79999999999995s)]
*  seminar talking about the need to turn Gaza into a wonderful waterfront. He was talking [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  about moving people out into the Negev Desert, which is in Israel, not to Egypt and Jordan. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=482.56s)]
*  So this is an idea that's been cooking for Trump, but he does have a sort of real estate [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=488.2s)]
*  developer's sense of here's opportunity, here's a demolition zone, let's figure out [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=492.64s)]
*  a way to rebuild it. In terms of what would be a sane alternative, the Biden administration, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=497.12s)]
*  Secretary of State and National Security Advisor both, have been pushing the idea that you [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  need a day after in Gaza in which you gradually give the Palestinian authority more and more [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=512.12s)]
*  responsibility so that you have Palestinians who are vetted by Israel, who have shown that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=519.12s)]
*  they can handle security duties, being responsible there. I don't see a better way than that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=525.92s)]
*  That's not something Trump is sympathetic to, but he better start looking at it because [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=533.68s)]
*  I don't see another way. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=536.96s)]
*  Yeah, David, clearly bringing a developer's mindset to the most fragile and fragmented [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=538.24s)]
*  foreign policy threat and debacle in the world. Carlos, this was seemingly the one thing that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  Republicans knee-jerk reaction was to say, this is crazy, insane, deranged. Those were [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=550.32s)]
*  actual quotes that we heard from Republicans and Democrats alike. Why is this the issue [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=555.5600000000001s)]
*  that they're willing to go to bat on against the administration? Is it because it just [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=560.6800000000001s)]
*  seems so out there that they feel like there's not a political tax? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=565.0s)]
*  Well, number one, it's pretty obvious, right? And I think easy to dismiss. It is a radical [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=568.4399999999999s)]
*  idea. To be fair, not more radical than having terrorists run Gaza, but still a radical idea. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=573.76s)]
*  And at the same time, it's inconsistent with what Trump has been telling congressional [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=579.6s)]
*  Republicans and the country for so long, right? That we should be investing in our own country, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=584.68s)]
*  that we should withdraw from conflict zones, that we shouldn't put our men and women in [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=590.28s)]
*  harm's way. Well, putting people in Gaza seems pretty dangerous to me. So I think a lot of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=595.72s)]
*  people on the Hill, and I was up there yesterday, were just kind of surprised that he would [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=600.9200000000001s)]
*  propose something that is so distant from the persona that he's created, from this idea [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=606.28s)]
*  that he's promoted, that the United States should actually withdraw from the world stage. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=612.84s)]
