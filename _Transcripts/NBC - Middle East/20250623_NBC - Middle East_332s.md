# 'A real divide': Yasmin Vossoughian on tensions inside Iran after U.S. strikes
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg)
*  The world is awaiting a response from Iran after US strikes on three of their nuclear [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=0.0s)]
*  sites last night. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=4.86s)]
*  Iran's president has already said the US must be held accountable and that it will be met [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=6.7s)]
*  with an appropriate response. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=10.94s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News correspondent Yasmin Vesugian. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=13.06s)]
*  Yasmin, it is so great to have you here with us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  We've seen reports of protests in Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  We know you have sources inside. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=23.84s)]
*  You know the country well. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  There's also an internet blackout. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=27.82s)]
*  To what extent have you been able to communicate with people and what are they telling you? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=29.68s)]
*  You can't call in. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=32.86s)]
*  They can't call out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=34.14s)]
*  There have been spots of intermittent communication in which you can communicate via text message. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=35.68s)]
*  But we've kind of had to go through various individuals and contacting people like third [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  party individuals that would then contact folks on the inside because you can actually [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  call each other domestically but you can't call from the outside. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=50.94s)]
*  And part of the reason is the government has shut down the internet because they're afraid [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Israel is essentially doing, you know, thinking that they're spying on them and could feasibly [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=59.12s)]
*  kind of geolocate, for instance, the Supreme Leader Khamenei and possibly, you know, assassinate [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  him if that in fact is part of their plan. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=68.24s)]
*  And so that's one of the reasons why they have kind of taken down the internet so far. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=70.52s)]
*  So it's been incredibly difficult to know what's going on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=73.56s)]
*  And by the way, it's incredibly difficult for Iranians domestically to understand really [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  what's going on, especially because of the internet blackout, despite the fact that they're [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=79.32s)]
*  able to communicate with each other. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=81.96s)]
*  If you remember a couple of days ago, President Trump said evacuate Tehran, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=82.96s)]
*  People stop, period, end of sentence. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=87.08s)]
*  The internet was already gone at that point. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=88.96s)]
*  So if you were inside Tehran... [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  Did that message filter through to people? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=92.88s)]
*  No. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=94.84s)]
*  People didn't know, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=95.84s)]
*  So you were then trying to get in touch with individuals if you knew of people inside Tehran [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=96.84s)]
*  saying you have to get out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=100.36s)]
*  But it was through third parties that could communicate with them or otherwise people [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=102.1s)]
*  that of course had access to Starlink, for instance, you know, Elon Musk got Starlink [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=106.44s)]
*  into motion in Iran, but not many people have access to Starlink in Iran. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=111.12s)]
*  So it's been incredibly difficult. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=113.96s)]
*  Both of those messages of evacuations in various areas throughout Tehran, but also just communicating [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=116.02s)]
*  with one another and understanding kind of the landscape of who's safe and who's not. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=121.34s)]
*  I will also say, though, part of this kind of communication blackout has allowed Iranians [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=124.38s)]
*  to go about their lives in kind of an ironic way because many of the people that were able [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=128.3s)]
*  to escape kind of the city center of Tehran that had the ability to, and I keep reminding [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=133.18s)]
*  people of this because I think it's important to talk about the socioeconomics of Iran. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=137.34s)]
*  And despite the fact that you do see kind of a wealthier class within the Iranian economy, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=140.7s)]
*  which already Iranians make a couple hundred dollars a month. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=145.18s)]
*  So there's not many people that can kind of escape Tehran and go to the countryside or [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=147.1s)]
*  their second homes as kind of the wealthier individuals can actually do. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=150.18s)]
*  But for those people that were able to escape, they don't necessarily know that Tehran is [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=155.62s)]
*  being bombed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=159.18s)]
*  They woke up, for instance, this morning unaware, for instance, that Natanz and Fordow and Isfahan [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=160.18s)]
*  had in fact been bombed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=165.34s)]
*  And it took kind of the news either coming in from local television, if in fact they [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=166.54s)]
*  were able to get that and or people reaching out from the outside via Internet. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=169.94s)]
*  If you can get through to let them know, hey, this is what's actually happening in your [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=178.02s)]
*  Can I ask you about the debate that's kind of raging among the Iranian diaspora? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=179.02s)]
*  And obviously the Iranian diaspora is obviously very vocal about what is happening in their [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=183.1s)]
*  native country right now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=187.38s)]
*  And there's a bit of a division as to whether or not they support this and whether or not [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  they want to get behind this and whether or not they would even support regime change [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=193.86s)]
*  at the behest of an American military and Israeli military operation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  You know, Iranians, you obviously know the Iranian mindset. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  It's not a monolithic group, but just give me a sense of the debate that is raging right [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  So I know that your producers said that we had some sound that you guys had gathered on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  the streets. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  One of the producers gathered on the streets. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  Can we play some of that sound? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  We don't have that sound yet. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  That's why I was just asking you to kind of talk to us about it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=216.46s)]
*  Sorry, that's me in the anchor chair. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=218.62s)]
*  Not your show. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=221.26000000000002s)]
*  So I think it's interesting because so the breakup, as we all well know of Iranians in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=224.9s)]
*  this country, is either, you know, you have Iranian Muslims in this country for the most [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=229.3s)]
*  part and or Iranian Jewish people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=233.1s)]
*  And with kind of the religious difference amongst the Iranian diaspora comes the difference [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  in opinion of what needs to be done with the country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=241.5s)]
*  And I always give these history lessons. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=244.46s)]
*  I know even often after we anchor together for so long, rolls his eyes when I give these [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=245.86s)]
*  history lessons. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=248.94s)]
*  But, you know, if you go back to 1979 with the Iranian revolution, Iranian Jewish people [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=249.94s)]
*  run out of the country for fear of persecution, for fear of even worse being killed by the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=253.98s)]
*  changeover to then Khomeini at the time, who was a supreme leader who came in during 1979. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=258.86s)]
*  And so you have a lot of the Iranian diaspora, understandably so, wanting to go back to their [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=264.78s)]
*  home country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=268.26s)]
*  They haven't been there since 1979. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=269.26s)]
*  These are people that had a robust life, a beautiful life in Iran that had to leave. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=270.26s)]
*  And because of that, they have now been displaced in places like Europe or the United States. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=275.14s)]
*  And they see what's happening in their home country. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=280.64s)]
*  And they're celebrating it because they want to be able to return. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=283.38000000000005s)]
*  And you can understand that from their perspective. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  But then you have the other side who sees the suffering that is happening inside this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=288.3s)]
*  country amongst Iranians overall and see people literally and figuratively running for their [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=293.70000000000005s)]
*  lives and wanting to stand behind their brethren inside Iran. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=298.58000000000004s)]
*  So it's a real divide. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=302.62s)]
*  A real divide and obviously one that doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon with what is [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=303.62s)]
*  happening. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=307.98s)]
*  Yasmin, it's great to see you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=308.98s)]
*  We're lucky to have your insight and analysis. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=309.98s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=311.82000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUzmCIngpXg&t=312.66s)]
