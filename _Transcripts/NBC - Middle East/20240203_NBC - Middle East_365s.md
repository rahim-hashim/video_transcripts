# Kier Simmons discusses regional implications of U.S. military strikes in Iraq and Syria
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4)
*  The Defense Department says that the U.S. military conducted strikes on seven facilities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=0.0s)]
*  used by Iran-linked militias, including more than 85 targets in Iraq and Syria that Iran's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated militias used to attack U.S. forces. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=12.44s)]
*  Joining us now from Northern Iraq, NBC News chief international correspondent Kier Simmons. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=18.04s)]
*  So Kier, the Iraqi reaction, the reaction in Baghdad has shown great sensitivity to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=22.68s)]
*  Iranian militias that are very powerful inside Iraq. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=29.68s)]
*  So they have called in the top diplomat there, the Sharjah Duffer, there's no ambassador [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=33.32s)]
*  in Baghdad, to protest. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=37.88s)]
*  That's right, Andrea. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=40.28s)]
*  And you know, I think for many Americans, it may feel a little like the light being [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  switched on in terms of the reach and the influence and the installations of Iran across [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=49.68s)]
*  the region viewed from one perspective. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=57.67999999999999s)]
*  The war in Gaza is acting as a kind of catalyst for a number of conflagrations in many places. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=61.4s)]
*  You spoke before the, with Clint before the break, about what was happening in Yemen with [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=67.8s)]
*  the Iranian-backed Houthis there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=72.88s)]
*  Now you have this campaign here by the U.S. targeting these Iranian-backed militia here [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=75.24s)]
*  in Iraq and over in Syria. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=80.72s)]
*  And I think for many watching, it will be underscoring the strength and the power of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  Iranian reach. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=89.64s)]
*  That may not be something that the Iranians are entirely comfortable with, honestly, but [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=91.08s)]
*  here in Iraq, to answer your question, we really are seeing just how tense it is because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=95.36s)]
*  the Iraqi government is both a partner to the U.S. and gets a substantial amount of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=102.52s)]
*  money from the U.S., but is also a partner to Iran. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=108.0s)]
*  And there are many here in this country who would like to see the U.S. leave here and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  would like to move further towards Iran. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  Now, we had that statement this morning, a blistering statement from the Iraqi government [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=120.44s)]
*  accusing the U.S. of deception, saying that Iraq wasn't warned and that Iraq is now on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=124.8s)]
*  the edge of the abyss. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=130.56s)]
*  Of course, one of the interesting factors to note is that the more warning that the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=132.6s)]
*  U.S. gave Iraq, effectively, they would be giving it to Iran because there's such a porous [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=137.76s)]
*  relationship with Iran that those messages would then be transferred over to Tehran very [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=142.84s)]
*  likely. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=149.4s)]
*  So an incredibly difficult balance for the Biden administration to get right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=150.4s)]
*  There are multiple risks here, of course. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=156.68s)]
*  The risk here in Iraq is that by doing this and by fueling anger, you actually push the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  Iraqis more towards Iran, which is exactly what the Iranians want. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=164.6s)]
*  Aside from that, of course, the other risks, that this spirals into a wider war and, conversely, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  that Tehran doesn't get the message that you simply, with these strikes, which are limited, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=174.56s)]
*  that you simply do not move the needle in terms of Iran's strategic objectives, just [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  to push America out of this region and to put pressure on Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=183.32s)]
*  Well, in addition to, of course, the U.S. forces that are deployed around the region, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=186.56s)]
*  some still fighting ISIS in Syria, you have the vulnerability of Israel to the north from [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=192.12s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=197.56s)]
*  Hezbollah and Israel have had their tit-for-tat strikes since October 7th, but it has not [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=198.56s)]
*  become a full-out engagement, a second front, if you will. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=204.92s)]
*  The U.S. calculation, I'm told, is that Hezbollah is more constrained, does not want, that Hezbollah [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=211.4s)]
*  leadership in Lebanon does not want another devastating war in Lebanon. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=217.52s)]
*  They've just rebuilt from the last one. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=221.24s)]
*  Is that what you're hearing in the region as well? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=226.0s)]
*  I mean, as ever, Andrea, you get right to the point. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  And just to pick up on the two points you're making there, I mean, one is about the complexity, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  this U.S. operation, the U.S. role here is not just about Iran. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=236.64s)]
*  It is very much about fighting ISIS, continuing that fight that effectively the U.S. won all [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=242.44s)]
*  those years ago. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=249.04s)]
*  There's that aspect. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=250.04s)]
*  But then when you talk about Hezbollah, I mean, that is such an important factor too. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=251.04s)]
*  And this is what the Israelis have been saying for a long time, is that effectively Syria, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  remember that borders Lebanon where Hezbollah are, is effectively a client state of Iran. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  When you look, when you talk to analysts about Syria, what you'll hear, for example, is that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=265.20000000000005s)]
*  the Iranians are building weapons, manufacturing facilities, enabling Iran to not even have [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=269.56s)]
*  to ship the weapons from Iran, but just to take them into Lebanon, to Hezbollah, straight [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  from Syria. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=282.12s)]
*  That's the kind of threat that the Israelis have been deeply, deeply worried about. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  They already have this potential front with Hezbollah, but they are very worried that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=286.56s)]
*  another front opens up with Syria. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=290.6s)]
*  That is why you've seen over many, many years operations by the Israelis inside Syria targeting [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=293.04s)]
*  Iranian-backed militia and even the Iranian Revolutionary Guard themselves. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=299.28s)]
*  Just this morning we heard about another strike south of Damascus, according to reports targeting [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=303.24s)]
*  an Iranian Revolutionary Guard operative there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=308.48s)]
*  That is what the Israelis are very, very concerned with. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  You've got to point out that ultimately this operation that we're seeing by the U.S. overnight, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=317.56s)]
*  and we're likely to see more stages, so far really has been limited for sending a message [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=321.68s)]
*  don't kill Americans. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  It is not trying to really address, over the many recent years, the growing strength of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=328.24s)]
*  Iran in the region. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=333.52s)]
*  Understandably so, perhaps, because that's how you get into an escalation, but it still [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=336.96s)]
*  leaves the open question about what you do about the strategic goals of Tehran. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGx4tP0TSj4&t=340.08s)]
