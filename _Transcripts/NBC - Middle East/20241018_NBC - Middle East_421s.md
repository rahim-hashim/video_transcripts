# ‘Now is the time:' Hostage families push for deal after Sinwar's death
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks)
*  Back with new reaction this morning from the families of American hostages held in Gaza, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=0.0s)]
*  calling the killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the October 7th attack, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=4.64s)]
*  a step toward justice, but urging authorities to seize this moment as an opportunity to bring [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=10.32s)]
*  their loved ones home, either through negotiation or by any other means. And joining us now is [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=16.64s)]
*  Ruby Hen, his son, Itai Hen, is one of seven American hostages held by Hamas. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=22.72s)]
*  Ruby, thank you for being here. I know it's difficult times for your family. What was [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  your first thought when you found out about Sinwar's death? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=35.36s)]
*  Yes, it's been 378 days since October 7th when I last talked to my son. And yes, we do feel justice [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=40.32s)]
*  to some extent. I'd like to remind the viewers that out of the 1,500 killed on October 7th, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=50.16s)]
*  there were 46 U.S. citizens that were killed on that date. That is the largest single terrorist [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=58.0s)]
*  attack in U.S. citizens. If you want to take out 9-11, you need to go back to the 1980s. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=65.12s)]
*  But on the same token, we the families are very much concerned that terrorists that are [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=71.44s)]
*  holding our loved ones might do irrational things in light of Sinwar assassination. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=79.2s)]
*  And we have, as much as possible, urged the government officials, both in the United States [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=89.12s)]
*  and Israel, to seize the moment in order to bring a deal and seal a deal that will end this madness [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=94.72s)]
*  and end the suffering of us, the hostage families, as well as the people in Gaza. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=103.92s)]
*  It's got to be gut-wrenching right now, Ruby. Prime Minister Netanyahu says the war is not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  yet over. What's your message to him in this moment? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  He got his moment, the moment that he was looking for of Sinwar being killed on the atrocities. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=123.2s)]
*  War crimes that he committed on October 7th. Now is the time to understand that it is time to move [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=132.88000000000002s)]
*  to the next chapter. The time is now to offer the Hamas people left behind, the Palestinian [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=141.52s)]
*  people in Gaza, that it is time to end this. The Israeli prime minister has said on multiple [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=150.8s)]
*  occasions that this war could end with the release of 101 hostages. Now is the time to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=157.28s)]
*  call to those people holding our loved ones. The Israeli administration, as well as the U.S. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=164.4s)]
*  administration, have promised amnesty, have promised safe passage to those people that are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=171.36s)]
*  holding our loved ones and will be able to provide them to us safely and will get a new beginning for [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=176.96s)]
*  their life as well. I know your family has also been in contact with the Biden administration [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=184.0s)]
*  about Itai. What does the U.S. need to do for him and his fellow American hostages right now? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=188.48s)]
*  Do you feel her, do you feel like your plight is being recognized and that action is being taken? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=194.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's an excellent question. I would like to take him back a month ago. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=205.44s)]
*  Now, we for 10 months, did calls with the White House and did meetings with the president [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  and his administration. We were representing eight U.S. hostages. A month ago, we suddenly became seven. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=217.44s)]
*  And I honestly felt that that would be an inflection point, a point in time where the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=227.12s)]
*  administration understands after killing from point blank of a U.S. citizen, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=232.96s)]
*  that the administration will understand it has no time and it needs to act differently. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  And I am sad to say I did not see a significant change in policy. And I hope now the administration [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  sees that this is a window of opportunity. It needs to seize it. It does not need to overthink it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  There needs to be a very concise, direct approach from the president. He is now in Germany, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=260.48s)]
*  calling all the players to come up, huddle together, if it is in Europe, if it is in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=269.68s)]
*  Camp David in the United States, and just hash out a deal that is based on the proposal that President [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=274.8s)]
*  Biden talked about a few months ago that was already approved by the Israeli prime minister. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=282.8s)]
*  So now it is just getting it done. We have been told multiple times it is like 90% done. We just [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=290.48s)]
*  need to get it to the finish line. So now is the time to have it. We are looking at all these [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  beautiful pictures of your son. What do you want people to know about Itai? Yeah, it has been a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  full year cycle, unfortunately, birthdays and anniversary and holidays such as Christmas, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=308.0s)]
*  Easter, Thanksgiving with an empty chair. Itai is a fun-loving kid. He has a loving girlfriend. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=316.48s)]
*  He is an avid basketball player. And I am a very proud New Yorker and New York Knicks fan. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=325.68s)]
*  NBA season is starting up. And for the love of God, I do not know how he became a Celtics fan. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=334.16s)]
*  And like any other father and son talking about basketball, and now suddenly I have something good [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=340.56s)]
*  to say about the Knicks and Itai is not here. It is just basic family stuff that you want him back. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=346.16s)]
*  And we have not gotten any type of information on Itai from October 7. We are hoping for some [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  sort of miracle in our case. And we just want to be a family again. And whatever outcome happens to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  us, the minimum that this administration as well as the Israeli government need to make us whole [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=373.2s)]
*  again. And I am sure anyone listening to us now, any family from Montana to Massachusetts to New [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=380.08s)]
*  Mexico can understand as a U.S. citizen, what are we asking? We are asking for this administration [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=385.92s)]
*  to do everything possible to make us whole again. Ruby Hen, thank you so much for joining us, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  holding you and your family in my heart. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=398.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_fWn5A0Ks&t=403.2s)]
