# Biden Says Afghanistan Evacuation Depends On Taliban Cooperation
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg)
*  I've met this morning with my counterparts in the G7, as well as heads of the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=0.0s)]
*  Nations, NATO, and the European Union. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=6.54s)]
*  I express my thanks for the solidarity we have seen as we've stood up an unprecedented [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=10.74s)]
*  global effort. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=16.32s)]
*  I updated our partners on the significant progress we've made in the past 10 days. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=18.28s)]
*  As of this afternoon, we've helped evacuate 70,700 people just since August 14th, 75,900 [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=24.5s)]
*  people since the end of July. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=33.42s)]
*  Just in the past 12 hours, another 19 U.S. military flights, 18 C-17s and one C-130, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=35.94s)]
*  carrying approximately 6,400 evacuees, and 31 coalition flights carrying 5,600 people [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=44.34s)]
*  have left Kabul just in the last 12 hours. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=52.74s)]
*  The total of 50 more flights, 12,000 more people since I updated you this morning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=57.02s)]
*  These numbers are a testament to the efforts of our brave service women and men, to our [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=63.34s)]
*  diplomats on the ground in Kabul, and to our allies still standing with us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=67.62s)]
*  And we had a productive discussion. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=73.42s)]
*  There was strong agreement among the leaders about both about the evacuation mission underway, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=74.9s)]
*  as well as the need to coordinate our approach to Afghanistan as we move forward. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=81.5s)]
*  First, on evacuation, we agreed that we will continue our close cooperation to get people [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  out as efficiently and safely as possible. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=94.46s)]
*  We are currently on a pace to finish by August 31st. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=97.5s)]
*  The sooner we can finish, the better. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=102.22s)]
*  Each day of operations brings added risk to our troops. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=104.78s)]
*  But the completion by August 31st depends upon the Taliban continuing to cooperate [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=109.34s)]
*  and allow access to the airport for those who were transporting out and no disruptions [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  to our operations. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  In addition, I've asked the Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  to adjust the timetable, should that become necessary. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=127.42s)]
*  I'm determined to ensure that we complete our mission, this mission. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  I'm also mindful of the increasing risk that I've been briefed on and the need to factor [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  those risks in. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=144.66s)]
*  They're real and significant challenges that we also have to take into consideration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=146.78s)]
*  The longer we stay, starting with the acute and growing risk of an attack by a terrorist [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=152.02s)]
*  group known as ISIS-K, an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, which is the sworn enemy of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=157.18s)]
*  the Taliban as well. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=163.22s)]
*  Every day we're on the ground, there's another day we know that ISIS-K is seeking to target [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=165.26s)]
*  the airport and attack both U.S. and allied forces and innocent civilians. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=169.98s)]
*  Additionally, thus far, the Taliban have been taking steps to work with us so we can get [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=176.14s)]
*  our people out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=183.34s)]
*  But it's a tenuous situation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=185.18s)]
*  We already had some gunfighting break out. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=187.62s)]
*  We run a serious risk of it breaking down as time goes on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=191.06s)]
*  Second, the G7 leaders and the leaders of the EU, NATO, and the UN all agreed that we [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=195.54s)]
*  will stand united in our approach to the Taliban. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=201.98s)]
*  We agreed the legitimacy of any future government depends on the approach it now takes to uphold [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  international obligations, including to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a base for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=213.9s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=218.82s)]
*  And we agreed that none of us are going to take the Taliban's word for it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=220.38s)]
*  We'll judge them by their actions and we'll stay in close coordination on any steps that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=225.14s)]
*  we take moving forward in response to the Taliban's behavior. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=230.94s)]
*  At the same time, we renewed our humanitarian commitment to the Afghan people and supported [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=235.34s)]
*  a proposal by the Secretary General Guterres of the United Nations-led International Response [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=241.14s)]
*  with unfettered humanitarian access in Afghanistan. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=246.8s)]
*  Third, we talked about our mutual obligation to support refugees and evacuees currently [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=250.8s)]
*  fleeing Afghanistan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=257.48s)]
*  The United States will be a leader in these efforts and will look to the international [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  community and to our partners to do the same. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC_DjE6CJcg&t=264.0s)]
