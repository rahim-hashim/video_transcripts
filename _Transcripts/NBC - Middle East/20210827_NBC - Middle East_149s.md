# Pentagon Confirms Only One Suicide Bomber In Kabul Airport Attack
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo)
*  And, Courtney, we've just been hearing from the Pentagon the latest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=0.0s)]
*  Why don't you bring us up to date on your big takeaways from the Pentagon briefing today? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  So there were a couple things. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=8.8s)]
*  I mean, I think the big headline was the fact that we now know there was only one suicide [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=9.8s)]
*  bombing yesterday after being briefed many times yesterday that there were two. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=12.92s)]
*  We also know that there was this extensive firefight afterwards as well. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=18.66s)]
*  That was sort of the big takeaway. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=24.12s)]
*  And I think people might be asking, well, why did it take almost 24 hours for that to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=25.6s)]
*  come out? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=30.0s)]
*  The early reports on these situations tend to be cloudy and end up being wrong in a lot [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=31.0s)]
*  of cases. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=37.36s)]
*  So that was one big thing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=38.36s)]
*  We also know the evacuation flights are continuing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=40.28s)]
*  The mission continues. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=43.56s)]
*  We don't have any reason to believe that the deadline of August 31st has changed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=44.92s)]
*  The U.S. military is still working towards that deadline. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=49.84s)]
*  And one thing that we should expect as these last couple of days and hours go towards this [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=52.88s)]
*  deadline is we will know less and less about the U.S. military presence and activities [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  on the ground there as we get closer. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=64.06s)]
*  And Andrea, I'm sure you remember as the U.S. was drawing down from the mission that began [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  – this drawdown that began back in April, the military information coming out became [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=71.36s)]
*  cloudier and cloudier and cloudier. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=76.76s)]
*  And that was for operational security reasons. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=78.28s)]
*  We should expect the same thing going forward here in Kabul with the U.S. military presence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=80.3s)]
*  That includes both the number and exactly what it is that they're doing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=84.82s)]
*  One thing that we can – we do know will be happening, though, is U.S. troops will [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=88.84s)]
*  begin leaving literally in the matter of the next day or two. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=93.5s)]
*  And that is because it will take several days to get all of the 5,000-plus troops out of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=97.9s)]
*  there and some of the equipment. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=102.1s)]
*  So the Pentagon has made it very clear that while they will prioritize lives on these [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=104.6s)]
*  final evacuation flights in the next couple of days, there is some equipment that they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  are planning to try to take out of there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=114.04s)]
*  We know that the military has aircraft. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=117.12s)]
*  They have counter drone and counter rocket equipment there called – generally called [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=119.94s)]
*  CRAMs. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  They also have some artillery there at the airport. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=126.22s)]
*  And then they have some large vehicles like MRAPs and some other equipment that have been [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  brought in specifically for this evacuation mission. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=132.44s)]
*  We can also expect that as they have to prioritize lives, we'll see some controlled detonations [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=135.44s)]
*  over the next few days. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=141.52s)]
*  That means they're going to go in, they're going to blow up some of this equipment on [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=142.72s)]
*  site because they don't want to leave it behind for the – to get into the Taliban [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=144.96s)]
*  hands, Andrea. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e8NHqbkASo&t=148.16s)]
