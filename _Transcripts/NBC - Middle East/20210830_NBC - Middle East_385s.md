# Hayes: U.S. Troops Are Finally Out Of Afghanistan—And It's Remarkable
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes on September 26th 2001 almost 20 years ago [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=0.0s)]
*  It was 15 days after the US was attacked on 9-eleven a dozen CIA operatives [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=5.84s)]
*  Landed in northern Afghanistan their mission was to lay the groundwork for the US invasion of the Taliban controlled country [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=12.0s)]
*  Since that day for nearly two straight decades there has been an American military presence in Afghanistan [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=20.04s)]
*  Until today this afternoon America's longest war was brought to a close [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=27.740000000000002s)]
*  I'm here to announce the completion of our withdrawal from Afghanistan in the end of the military mission to evacuate American citizens [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=34.18s)]
*  third country nationals and vulnerable Afghans [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=41.94s)]
*  The last c-17 lifted off from Hamid Karzai International Airport on August 30th this afternoon at [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  329 p.m. East Coast time and the last manned aircraft is now clearing the airspace above Afghanistan [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=51.9s)]
*  In so many ways the US military's exit from Afghanistan has been as wrenching and morally fraught as the occupation and the war itself [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=59.1s)]
*  There's been a continuity in fact between the two [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=67.7s)]
*  Last week after the fall of the country of the Taliban again and as the US withdrawal continued an attack near the airport in Kabul [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=70.54s)]
*  Killed 13 US service members and more than 100 Afghan civilians [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=78.94s)]
*  ISIS K an affiliate of the Islamic State claimed responsibility [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=84.18s)]
*  President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden paid their respects to the fallen yesterday [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=88.18s)]
*  joining their families for the dignified transfer of their remains at Dover Air Force Base and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=93.14s)]
*  On top of that brutal loss came the news of our retaliation [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=98.14s)]
*  In response to that act of mass murder [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  US military launched a drone strike targeting an Islamic State car bomb that Central Command said posed an imminent threat to the airport [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=105.94s)]
*  That strike killed 10 Afghan civilians according to family members [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=113.86s)]
*  All 10 were extended family and several were small children [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=118.42s)]
*  An Afghan journalist told the BBC the family were planning to come to the United States on special immigrant visas [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=122.7s)]
*  The family [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=129.32s)]
*  Were expecting an SIV they had received a call that you know [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=131.32s)]
*  A car will come and get you to the airport any day now [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=134.72s)]
*  And that's why there were so many people in the house [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=137.68s)]
*  They had all relocated to that one house and were waiting to leave [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=140.16s)]
*  And this is something that the neighbors and the family kept saying if you were willing to give them a visa to come to your country [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=144.8s)]
*  How could you end up killing them and accusing them of being Daesh? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=150.32s)]
*  Pentagon says they are quote not in a position to dispute those reports and they are investigating [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=154.64s)]
*  This is precisely the horrifying moral truth of the entire war [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=160.64s)]
*  A war that was initially justified not at all crazily by the fact that the Taliban did indeed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  Harbor a man who had pulled off the most lethal terrorist attack on US soil [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  A war that metastasized for 20 years punctuated by unspeakable violence [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=176.56s)]
*  A war with the supposed aim of propping up an independent Afghan government that fell in a matter of days [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=180.72s)]
*  A war that has now ended with the return of the Taliban [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  For all the arguments happening now, but the moral shortcomings of the US military's exit and the Afghans left behind [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm reminded of a saying [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=198.4s)]
*  The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=200.4s)]
*  And the Taliban's return was a long time ago [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=203.52s)]
*  I'm reminded of a saying the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=206.08s)]
*  The best time to leave Afghanistan was years ago, but the second best time is now [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=213.04s)]
*  Now it is done [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=218.24s)]
*  That does not mean of course, this is the end of the story by any means afghanistan remains a country nearly [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=220.48s)]
*  40 million people facing dire circumstances [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=225.2s)]
*  With the us and gone the taliban in charge and the economic future very much in doubt [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=228.64s)]
*  The taliban who gave al-qaeda safe haven are indeed a vicious faction of ideologues infamous around the world for the violent mayhem [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  of their misogyny particularly [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=241.12s)]
*  It was of course a member of the taliban who shot a young girl named malala [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  Yusasi in the head because she advocated for education of girls and now the taliban are back in power after 20 years with [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=247.42s)]
*  a state to run [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=255.12s)]
*  They claim they will respect women's rights this time [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=257.36s)]
*  They claim women will be allowed even to attend universities and female only classes as long as their studies are in line with the taliban's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=259.44s)]
*  interpretation of islamic law [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=266.22s)]
*  But they are also a faction that malamud's govern must run a state after 20 years as militants [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=268.72s)]
*  And the last time around it didn't go very well. In fact the lack of international support there were a handful of nations that recognize the taliban [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=274.64s)]
*  Helped pave the way for their ejection from power. And so perhaps it is not actually all that surprising [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  The taliban did in fact cooperate with the united states military for security purposes after the last over the last couple weeks [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=287.12s)]
*  The biden administration got a lot of flak about quote unquote trust in the taliban [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=294.72s)]
*  But it is a fact they were in a position where they could have killed a lot of u.s troops and a lot of civilians [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=298.88000000000005s)]
*  They did not [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=305.12s)]
*  That fraught and tenuous partnership with the taliban the u.s military was able to pull off one of the largest airlifts in history evacuating [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=306.8s)]
*  More than 120 000 people since last month [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=314.8s)]
*  an incredible logistical achievement [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=318.48s)]
*  Tens of thousands of afghan refugees have now touched down in countries around the world from katar to albania to here in the united states [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=321.36s)]
*  All hoping to find somewhere to rebuild rebuild their lives in safety [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=328.88s)]
*  And so here we stand a new chapter for afghanistan a new chapter for us [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=334.0s)]
*  It is a fact that ending this war required a level of resolve that no one had prior to president joe biden [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=339.2s)]
*  It required standing up to the vast establishment consensus and confronting the fickleness of american opinion [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=345.04s)]
*  Joe biden has done that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=351.36s)]
*  The actual evacuation of all u.s troops has finally happened [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=353.2s)]
*  While there is very little joy to find in any of this long painful story the actual end of this war is a remarkable thing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=356.96s)]
*  You [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJFVYn1D4A&t=374.56s)]
