# 'Major milestone for the Israelis': Hamas leader Sinwar killed by IDF
**NBC - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg)
*  Director Brennan, there is no doubt that this is significant. There was a expert who called this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=0.0s)]
*  the most dramatic achievement for Israel since October 6, militarily, and for the Israeli people. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=8.72s)]
*  We see the folks who are out there in Tel Aviv, many of them holding signs now, calling for a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=15.52s)]
*  ceasefire deal. Put this in the big picture for us in the Middle East. What does this mean? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=21.2s)]
*  Well, it is a major milestone for the Israelis. Over the past year, they have destroyed a lot of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=27.84s)]
*  Hamas's war-making capability, terrorist-making capability, and has taken off the battlefield [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  senior Hamas operatives. But they needed to get the architect of the October 7 attacks, but also [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=38.48s)]
*  the person who is in control of Hamas's war-making capabilities inside of Gaza. He also is the head [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=45.28s)]
*  of their political bureau. So this is a very important step that they've taken, but they need [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=51.2s)]
*  to be able to demonstrate to the Israeli people, I think, and to the world that now they're going [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=56.48s)]
*  to be able to move forward with the path that seeks to bring the bloodshed to a halt. See whether [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=61.36s)]
*  or not this is an opening that Prime Minister Netanyahu can say. We've achieved almost all of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=67.44s)]
*  our objectives in terms of destroying Hamas's capabilities. Now we need to find out a way [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=73.44s)]
*  forward. I'm hoping that's going to happen. We'll have to see because also it's so dependent on a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  ceasefire to get the hostages out, and we have been stuck on that. And Yahya Sinwar was a major [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=84.56s)]
*  obstacle to it. He was refusing to negotiate in some of these engagements, and so therefore I [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=89.84s)]
*  think we do have a possibility of some, you know, openings here in the future. A major obviously [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=94.88s)]
*  contributor to any or detriment to any possible ceasefire deal. But what about Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=101.12s)]
*  What do you think his next move is? What would you expect to hear from him perhaps in the next hour [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  or two? Well I think he's certainly going to applaud the work of the Israeli Defense Forces, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=113.92s)]
*  the IDF, in terms of the work that they have done there and the importance of taking Yahya Sinwar [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=119.12s)]
*  off of that battlefield. I like to think that he's also going to appeal to the Palestinian people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=124.4s)]
*  because Yahya Sinwar also was a very brutal and ruthless executioner of Palestinians in Gaza who [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=128.48s)]
*  were working with the Israelis. He had this reputation of doing these very, you know, strong [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=135.52s)]
*  torture sessions and executing individuals if they were found to be helping the Israelis in any [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=141.28s)]
*  way. So he was an obstacle not just over the past year in terms of hostage negotiations and ceasefire, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=145.28s)]
*  but he's been an obstacle over the course of many years to see whether or not Israel and the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=150.56s)]
*  Palestinian people in Gaza could in fact find some way to move forward together in peace. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=154.72s)]
*  David, to pick up on what the director was saying, your paper reminds us today that back in 1989 [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=160.72s)]
*  when Yahya Sinwar was the internal enforcer for Hamas, he was being interrogated about his [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=166.48s)]
*  murders and they included forcing a Hamas fighter to bury his own brother alive. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=171.76s)]
*  Fast forward to just this week, we heard from the parents of Hirsch Goldberg-Polin [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=177.6s)]
*  that he was on his knees when he was shot trying to shield himself with his one hand. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=182.08s)]
*  Talk about that level of ruthlessness and where it comes from. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=188.32s)]
*  So Yahya Sinwar's level of violence reminds me of the Islamic State, almost a theater of cruelty [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=192.32s)]
*  in the way that he punished Palestinian enemies. He buried one alive reportedly, as you just said. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=202.48s)]
*  He said to drop boiling oil on others. He was interrogating. He was a harsh, cruel man. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=209.04s)]
*  And I think that's one reason that his death is such an important symbolic moment of victory for [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=216.96s)]
*  Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu will soon be on television saying, we have done what we promised. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=224.0s)]
*  The architect of October 7 has been killed. Whether beyond the symbolism this really means [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=231.2s)]
*  an end or the beginning of the end of the war in Gaza, we just can't say. We don't know how [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=239.04s)]
*  Hamas or the people of Gaza will respond. We don't know how Iran will respond. Yahya Sinwar was [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=246.72s)]
*  their key proxy. He was communicating with Iran. We now know about his hopes for overturning Israel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=253.36s)]
*  So I think there are many, many questions ahead. But he was an extraordinary leader. This is a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=261.6s)]
*  symbolic victory, but also really important tactically. He ran this war. He conducted a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=267.68s)]
*  masterful campaign of deceit to hide the intentions of Hamas for several years before October 7, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=274.16s)]
*  pretending that Hamas had peaceful intentions and tricking the Israeli intelligence services, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=280.8s)]
*  arguably among the best in the world, into believing that Hamas didn't want war [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=286.4s)]
*  right up to the hours before Hamas broke through the fence from Gaza. So today is a huge day, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  but there's so many questions that I'm going to be watching. I think the whole world will be. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, the intelligence services and Benjamin Netanyahu himself, director, took an enormous hit [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=307.6s)]
*  after October 7. And we were speaking before we went on the air here about what you have seen [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=314.16s)]
*  as somebody who's a former CIA director from Israeli intelligence from then until now, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  more than a year later. What is the status as you see it now that might be different [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  of Israeli intelligence? Well, clearly there was an abysmal intelligence failure that led to the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  October 7 attacks. And over the past year, I think the Israeli intelligence really has enhanced [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=339.36s)]
*  their collection capabilities and their efforts to try to get better sense of where a lot of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=345.12s)]
*  these senior leaders are. We saw what happened in Lebanon against Hezbollah in terms of being able [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=350.24s)]
*  to identify where Nasrallah was, as well as this very sophisticated operation in terms of the pagers [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  that exploded. But also in Gaza, I think the Israelis have found that all that tunnel network [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=361.2s)]
*  in Gaza has really been quite challenging and difficult. But I must say the Israeli [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=368.0s)]
*  intelligence services that includes Shin Bet, which is domestic, Mossad, which is the foreign, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=372.08s)]
*  and the Israeli Defense Forces Intelligence as well, I think they have shown tremendous [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=376.72s)]
*  capability to bring their capabilities together and to be able to target those individuals, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=381.2s)]
*  as well as those capabilities that pose the most significant threat to the state of Israel. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=386.56s)]
*  It doesn't surprise you that, first of all, this was part of a routine operation, and second of all, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=390.48s)]
*  that Sinwar was above ground anyway in the first place, as I think Richard Engel described it, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=395.44s)]
*  reduced to behaving more like a foot soldier. Yeah, well, I think as David alluded to, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=402.24s)]
*  Sinwar was a masterful leader in many respects in terms of orchestrating the Hamas members. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=408.4s)]
*  But also he was very, very sophisticated, and he understood the Israelis. And I think [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=415.2s)]
*  he was trying to hide almost in plain sight as far as working with the other Hamas [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=420.08s)]
*  militants that were on the ground while the Israelis were pursuing all these different [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=425.12s)]
*  tunnels in this very vast network underground. So the fact that he was able to stay alive for [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=429.44s)]
*  the past year, I think, demonstrates just how crafty and clever he has been. But obviously, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=434.72s)]
*  time ran out on him. And again, it seems to be just an operation that happened. But also, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=440.8s)]
*  again, it's not like the Osama bin Laden operation that took years and years of planning and tedious [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=448.48s)]
*  intelligence collection to get. But I think the symbolism and the impact of Yahya Sinwar's [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=454.0s)]
*  departure is similar to what happened when Osama bin Laden was killed. You've taken away the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=459.04s)]
*  architect of such a heinous attack against the United States and Israel. And therefore, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=464.88s)]
*  the organization itself is going to be in a bit of disarray in terms of who is now going to assume [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=470.08s)]
*  the mantle leadership. There are a lot of extremists within the Hamas organization, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=475.2s)]
*  and we'll have to see how this sorts itself out. And this is where I think the Israeli [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=479.36s)]
*  intelligence is going to have to continue to do its work in Gaza to find out those individuals [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=482.72s)]
*  and how Hamas, the organization, is going to be reacting to this death. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=487.12s)]
*  CONSUELO MACK-MILLER Let me ask you about post-death intelligence [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  information gathering. And I should say that we have confirmed, my colleague Andrea Mitchell [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=495.44000000000005s)]
*  has confirmed, from a senior Israeli official in Tel Aviv that IDF did confirm his death [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  from fingerprints on the body. Obviously, we've talked about the fact over the last several hours [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=507.20000000000005s)]
*  that Sinwar was in an Israeli prison, and they had a lot of information on him. But there had been [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  previous reports that he had died, and they obviously turned out not to be true. Would you [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=519.52s)]
*  imagine by now they may have multiple points of information to tell them this is Sinwar? They [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=525.04s)]
*  wouldn't say that it was Sinwar if they weren't sure of it. And what are they doing now after [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=530.16s)]
*  collecting his body? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=536.0s)]
*  MICHAEL SHERMAN Well, the physical resemblance, I think, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=537.04s)]
*  was the initial tip-off that in fact they might have killed Sinwar. And that's why they said they [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=539.2s)]
*  needed to have the confirmation with DNA. And since Sinwar was in Israeli prison for many years, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  they have a lot of DNA. And with the body then, it's not just a fingerprint, it's actual DNA that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=547.84s)]
*  they can test and have conclusive and be very confident that this was, in fact, Sinwar. But now, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=552.88s)]
*  again, what they're going to do with the body, I think the Israelis are going to try to respect [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=559.6s)]
*  the Islamic customs, whether or not they're going to reach back to Sinwar's family or somehow. But [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure they're going to take care of the body in the appropriate way. Now that they have the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=568.56s)]
*  confirmation, again, through DNA, I don't think there's any more proof that they need that Sinwar [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=573.52s)]
*  is actually dead. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsHdk_xsxg&t=577.5999999999999s)]
