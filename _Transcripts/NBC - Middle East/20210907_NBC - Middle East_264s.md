# Afghan Pop Star Aryana Sayeed Speaks Out After Fleeing Country
**NBC - Middle East:** [September 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk)
*  Joining me now is Ariana Sayeed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=0.0s)]
*  She is an Afghan singer, songwriter, and TV personality [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=2.84s)]
*  who recently fled the country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=6.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=7.88s)]
*  First of all, just tell us about how you're doing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=9.74s)]
*  in your personal experience, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=11.52s)]
*  what it was like for you to flee your home country. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=12.58s)]
*  When did you make the decision to leave? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=15.82s)]
*  Well, I actually left Afghanistan on the second day [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=20.36s)]
*  of when Taliban took over Kabul. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=24.36s)]
*  And obviously I fled in a really, really bad situation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=28.04s)]
*  It was extremely difficult. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=31.54s)]
*  We had to go through thousands of people, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=33.34s)]
*  walk through them, walk through bullets. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=36.1s)]
*  And finally we made it to the American army base [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=38.5s)]
*  where they took us on a C-17 plane to America. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  But obviously, you know, it was a disastrous situation [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=48.58s)]
*  for thousands of people who were just waiting there, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=52.42s)]
*  you know, with their documents in their hands [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=55.6s)]
*  and they couldn't be taken away, unfortunately. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=57.52s)]
*  And they were all left behind. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=60.0s)]
*  I'm curious to get your thoughts [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=62.2s)]
*  about how the international community is reacting [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  to this Taliban now announced government. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=67.2s)]
*  What's your reaction to the formation of this government [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=70.68s)]
*  and the ministers? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=74.08s)]
*  Do you believe that this time will be any different [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=75.38s)]
*  in any way? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=79.04s)]
*  They say they want international cooperation [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  and peace with countries. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  Do you have any reason to believe that will be the case? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=84.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, to be quite honest with you, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=89.2s)]
*  I'm quite disappointed with the international community, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=91.78s)]
*  how they left Afghanistan in the hands of a bunch [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  of terrorists who, you know, actually showed who they are [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=97.98s)]
*  20 years ago and we're back in the same place again. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  And right now, whatever that's happening in Afghanistan, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=106.2s)]
*  how they're a bunch of terrorists at the heads [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=109.66000000000001s)]
*  of so many ministries, it's just quite shocking to me. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=114.42s)]
*  And I hope, I really hope that the international community [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  do not recognize Taliban officially, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=120.54s)]
*  because as you can see, so many of them, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=123.06s)]
*  for example, Siraj Haqqani, he was a terrorist [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=125.64000000000001s)]
*  on whose head had put like, I think $5 million [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=128.74s)]
*  to catch him a few years ago [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  because of his link with Al-Qaeda. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=134.94s)]
*  And so, and you know, part of the new government, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=137.26000000000002s)]
*  and this is not acceptable to anybody, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=143.4s)]
*  to any Afghan around the world, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=145.94s)]
*  and it shouldn't be acceptable to the international community. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=147.84s)]
*  And I hope that they understand that these Taliban [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  are not new, that they are the same terrorists [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  that they were, there is no women affair ministry [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=155.98000000000002s)]
*  in Afghanistan right now, women are not involved [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=161.82000000000002s)]
*  in this government, and it's just unfair and unacceptable, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=163.72s)]
*  and it shouldn't be acceptable for anybody [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=167.98s)]
*  in the entire planet. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=170.02s)]
*  What would your message be to Afghan women [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=171.32s)]
*  who have stayed behind in Afghanistan? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=173.76s)]
*  Obviously you're a very influential figure in that country, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=175.72s)]
*  certainly a lot of women look up to you as well. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=179.86s)]
*  You left that country, but what would you say [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=182.86s)]
*  to the women who have stayed behind, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=184.62s)]
*  perhaps some of them who are taking to the streets [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=186.5s)]
*  and risking their lives now to demonstrate? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  I actually was quite thrilled today [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=192.58s)]
*  when I saw videos of women doing protests [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  on the streets, demonstrations, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  and it was so brave of them to do that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=201.0s)]
*  This is a complete change for Afghan women. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=203.5s)]
*  I mean, the women today is obviously different [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  than the women 20 years ago, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  and I'm very, very proud of the fact [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=211.4s)]
*  that they're standing for themselves [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=213.72s)]
*  and they're asking for their rights, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=215.68s)]
*  and I really hope that they continue with that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=217.58s)]
*  And I hope that the world, that the international community [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  would hear their voice and they would actually help them, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  and they would push Taliban and put pressure on them [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=229.52s)]
*  to act humanly with Afghan women [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=235.16s)]
*  and to give them their rights. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  All right, Ariana, Sayeed, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=240.56s)]
*  thank you so much for your time and your insights. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  I greatly appreciate it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-NKW_fjdk&t=243.3s)]
