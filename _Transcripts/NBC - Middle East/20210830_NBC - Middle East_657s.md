# With Final Exit, U.S. Joins List Of Countries Unable To Break Afghanistan's Will
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78)
*  The British invaded Afghanistan in 1839. They were in charge in India, right next door. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=0.0s)]
*  Their reach as the British Empire extended around the world. They were worried that the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=10.32s)]
*  regime in charge in Afghanistan in the 1830s. They were worried that they were siding with [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=16.0s)]
*  Russia instead of them, giving Russia too much influence in a place where Britain thought [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=22.84s)]
*  that really they should be in charge. So in 1839, the Brits invaded Afghanistan. They tried to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=26.9s)]
*  install their own guy who they had handpicked to run Afghanistan, who they thought would make [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=33.379999999999995s)]
*  Afghanistan more closely allied with them. The British Army stayed for several years fighting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=37.3s)]
*  that war, but in the end it did not work out. The Brits left in 1842. But then 35, 40 years later, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=42.66s)]
*  the British Army tried again. The Brits were freaked out all over again that a place they [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=51.9s)]
*  thought ought to be allied with them was actually more inclined toward Russia. Same thing that had [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=58.94s)]
*  driven them 35, 40 years before. And so in 1878, the British invaded Afghanistan again. And again, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=64.02s)]
*  they installed their own handpicked guy. This time for a hot minute, they actually thought they [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=71.3s)]
*  had won and that Afghanistan would have a long-term alliance with Britain, which is what they were [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=76.26s)]
*  seeking in that first and second war. But their guy that they installed on top of the Afghan [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  government, he abdicated and Afghanistan went back to its previous ways again and the British [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=85.5s)]
*  left again. How long does it take to forget? It was 35 or 40 years between the first British [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=91.38s)]
*  war in Afghanistan and the second one. It was another 35 or 40 years until they invaded a third [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=97.94s)]
*  time. At the close of World War I, the British again invaded Afghanistan and fought another war [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=103.86s)]
*  there. That one ended with Afghanistan signing a treaty that recognized its independence. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=110.42s)]
*  Great Britain invaded Afghanistan three different times to try to keep Afghanistan in their orbit. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=116.9s)]
*  Three invasions, three wars. The answer was no every time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  And [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=126.18s)]
*  fast forward 102 years. It was just earlier this month, August 19th, that Afghan celebrated what [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=129.06s)]
*  they to this day call Independence Day. Afghan Independence Day every year celebrates that peace [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=137.22s)]
*  treaty that gave them their independence as a nation in 1919. Independence from Great Britain [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=143.3s)]
*  at the end of the third British invasion of Afghanistan. And it is gravely, gravely oversimplifying [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=149.7s)]
*  to say it this way. But if you did have to boil it down, the reason Great Britain kept invading [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  Afghanistan over and over again is because they really did think that Afghanistan was too cozy [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=164.66s)]
*  with Russia. They wanted to stop that alliance. They wanted Afghanistan in their British orbit [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  instead. After the peace treaty in 1919, in which Afghanistan formally got its independence [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=174.82s)]
*  after fighting off three different British invasions, well, the Afghan government at the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=181.7s)]
*  time actually did kind of sign themselves up with the Russians. They were one of the first countries [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=187.06s)]
*  to recognize the new Soviet states after Russia had its revolution in 1917. I mean, in in playground [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=190.82s)]
*  terms, again, in grossly oversimplified terms, that means in the battle for having influence [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=198.5s)]
*  over Afghanistan, the Russians sort of won and Britain lost despite years and years of fighting [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=204.26s)]
*  in three different wars there, despite the Brits losing thousands of soldiers there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=211.94s)]
*  But the Russians, as you know, soon the Soviets, they would end up having their own drama and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  trauma with the Afghan people and the Afghan government, because the Afghan government, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  while it had recognized the post-Zarist, so soon to be Soviet states, while they had allied [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  themselves with Russia, this thing that Britain had been so worried about for so many generations, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  ultimately, even when they had a government that had allied itself with the Soviet Union, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=241.22s)]
*  the population of Afghanistan didn't necessarily like that. They didn't necessarily like or want [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=246.02s)]
*  Afghanistan being run by a communist Soviet allied government. And so they started an insurgency [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=251.62s)]
*  against it. After all those wars, the British fought in the previous century to try to keep [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=259.86s)]
*  Afghanistan on their side, all of which ultimately failed. It was Russia, the Soviet Union that felt [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=265.46s)]
*  it necessary to invade Afghanistan themselves in 1979 to try to keep the Afghan government on their [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=273.38s)]
*  side, despite an insurgency in the country that rejected Russian influence. In that war, after [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=280.34s)]
*  the Soviet Union invaded, the United States got involved tentatively at first and then ultimately, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=289.14s)]
*  with some considerable enthusiasm, on the side of the insurgents who were making things so hard for [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=293.53999999999996s)]
*  the USSR. But with us or without us, the history of Afghanistan, even the modern history of Afghanistan, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=300.41999999999996s)]
*  is enough to have made the outcome of the Soviet Union's war there sort of a foregone conclusion. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=310.18s)]
*  Why do outside invaders, even big, powerful, influential, rich, well-resourced invaders, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=316.9s)]
*  keep losing wars there? Is it because of something about the invaders or is it because of something [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=323.46s)]
*  about Afghanistan? I mean, think about it. The British tried three times and failed. It takes [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=328.74s)]
*  brass to call that a British problem, especially since they did iterate. They did learn from their [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=333.94s)]
*  previous mistakes a little bit. They did get a little better at fighting those wars with each [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=339.06s)]
*  successive invasion. I mean, they had war one, then a do-over, then war two, then another do-over. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=343.14s)]
*  Each time, they got a little better at achieving some interstitial strategic objective that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=348.5s)]
*  ostensibly made the war worth it, that ostensibly pointed them toward some sort of victory. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=353.14s)]
*  But regardless, in the end, big picture, three tries, three losses. And Russia knew that history [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=358.82s)]
*  when they themselves invaded in 1979. And maybe Russia thought it was just something wrong with [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=364.26s)]
*  the British that made them fail in all their wars. Maybe they thought, we, the Soviet Union, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=371.14s)]
*  will do it better. Who doesn't think they could do a better job than the last guy who failed? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=375.46s)]
*  But the problem wasn't necessarily the character of the invasion, the way the invaders waged the war. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=381.94s)]
*  They tried a lot of different versions of it. The problem, more likely, was Afghanistan, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=390.9s)]
*  which for all its poverty and internecine conflict and everything else, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=396.65999999999997s)]
*  Afghanistan doesn't particularly want to be under any other country's remote control. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=404.18s)]
*  And so when the Soviet Union invaded in 1979, the modern history of Afghanistan would have told them [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=411.46s)]
*  how that would end. But they invaded, and then just shy of a decade after they invaded in 1989, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=416.82s)]
*  the Soviets went home, too. They went home February 15, 1989. Remember, I talked about the length of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=423.62s)]
*  time between all the various British invasions of Afghanistan, those three different wars, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=430.18s)]
*  it's like 35, 40 years between them. How long does it take to forget? How long does it take to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=435.46s)]
*  decide to do it again? Today marks roughly 32 and a half years, 12,000 days since the Soviet [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=440.9s)]
*  withdrawal from Afghanistan, between the end of that war and the end of today of ours. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  Good afternoon, everyone. I'm here to announce the completion of our withdrawal from Afghanistan [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=458.65999999999997s)]
*  and the end of the military mission to evacuate American citizens. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=463.53999999999996s)]
*  In the end of the military mission to evacuate American citizens, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=466.82s)]
*  third country nationals and vulnerable Afghans, the last C-17 lifted off from Hamid Karzai [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=470.74s)]
*  International Airport on August 30th this afternoon at 3.29 p.m. East Coast time. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=477.14s)]
*  And the last manned aircraft is now clearing the airspace above Afghanistan. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=483.14s)]
*  While the military evacuation is complete, the diplomatic mission to ensure [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  additional U.S. citizens and eligible Afghans who want to leave continues. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=492.09999999999997s)]
*  And I know that you have heard and I know that you're going to hear more about that from the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=496.41999999999996s)]
*  State Department shortly. Tonight's withdrawal signifies both the end of the military component [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=499.7s)]
*  of the evacuation, but also the end of the nearly 20-year mission that began in Afghanistan shortly [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=505.78s)]
*  after September 11th, 2001. It's a mission that brought Osama bin Laden to a just end, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=511.85999999999996s)]
*  along with many of his al-Qaeda co-conspirators. And it was not a cheap mission. The cost was [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=518.02s)]
*  2,461 U.S. service members and civilians killed and more than 20,000 who were injured. Sadly, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=523.9399999999999s)]
*  that includes 13 U.S. service members who were killed last week by an ISIS-K suicide bomber. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=530.34s)]
*  We honor their sacrifice today as we remember their heroic accomplishments. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=536.42s)]
*  No words from me could possibly capture the full measure of sacrifices [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=541.78s)]
*  and accomplishments of those who served, nor the emotions they're feeling at this moment. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=546.9799999999999s)]
*  But I will say that I'm proud that both my son and I have been a part of it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=551.86s)]
*  Proud that both my son and I have been a part of it. That's a reminder of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=557.4599999999999s)]
*  how concentrated U.S. military service is in our country. Families often sending multiple generations [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=562.18s)]
*  into the service, even simultaneously, while the vast majority of Americans don't serve [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=569.78s)]
*  in the military. Also a reminder that of the young soldiers and airmen and marines who died [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=575.38s)]
*  just last week in Afghanistan, some were literally babies on 9-11. They weren't even walking or [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=581.62s)]
*  talking at the time of the precipitating event for the war in which they died. They were toddlers [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=588.18s)]
*  at the time the starting gun was fired to start this war that ultimately ended their lives. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=594.9s)]
*  The last U.S. planes left the airport in Kabul today, August 30th, East Coast time, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=599.3s)]
*  which was basically midnight in Kabul when they left. It's the deadline set by President Biden. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=606.9799999999999s)]
*  The last two Americans on the ground before the plane closed its doors and took off [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=613.78s)]
*  were General Christopher Donahue, who was directly in charge of overseeing the Kabul airport [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=617.62s)]
*  airlift. That's him here in this image released tonight by the Defense Department, the last U.S. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=621.78s)]
*  soldier leaving Afghanistan. Also on that plane, the other man left as the last man [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=626.26s)]
*  beside him was Ross Wilson, who's the top U.S. diplomat in Kabul. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=633.14s)]
*  you [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WacRtdD78&t=656.26s)]
