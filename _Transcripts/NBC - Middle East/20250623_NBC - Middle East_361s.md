# Stock futures fall, oil prices rise after U.S. strikes on Iran
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE)
*  We are already seeing some economic knock-on effects from last night's strikes in Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=0.0s)]
*  Oil prices today jumped to a five-month high, with Brent crude, which is a global benchmark [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  for oil prices, soaring as much as 5.7 percent after the market opened this evening. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=12.0s)]
*  Oil had already surged over 10 percent since Israel launched strikes against Iran a week [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=18.04s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=22.56s)]
*  This all comes amid growing questions about whether Iran is going to move forward with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=23.56s)]
*  closing the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=27.96s)]
*  Located along part of Iran's southern border, the strait connects the Persian Gulf to the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=30.96s)]
*  open ocean. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=35.84s)]
*  A large portion of the world's oil and liquefied natural gas passes through at about 20 percent, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=36.84s)]
*  meaning that a blockade would send oil prices soaring. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=43.88s)]
*  Joining us now, Halima Croft, RBC Capital Markets global head of commodity strategy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Halima, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=52.36s)]
*  How devastating could Iran's closure of the Strait of Hormuz be to both the broader global [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=54.84s)]
*  economy but also to Iran itself? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=61.2s)]
*  I mean, the closure of the Strait of Hormuz would be a scenario. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=63.24s)]
*  We would obviously see oil prices return to triple-digit levels. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=66.64s)]
*  Now the real question, though, is does Iran have the capacity to actually physically close [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=70.08s)]
*  the straits? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=75.0s)]
*  Now, most security experts do not think they could close the straits for an extended period [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=76.0s)]
*  of time. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=80.14s)]
*  The U.S. Fifth Fleet is in Bahrain. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=81.14s)]
*  That would be called upon to reopen the straits. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=83.7s)]
*  But Iran does have the capacity to target tankers in the straits. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=86.22s)]
*  They did target two tankers in 2019 off the coast of UAE after we reimposed maximum pressure [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=90.86s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=96.38s)]
*  They also retained short-range missiles that could target key energy facilities in the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=97.38s)]
*  Gulf. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=101.58s)]
*  And they also have proxy groups in places like Iraq that could target energy infrastructure [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=102.58s)]
*  in that important producing country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=106.56s)]
*  So again, there's a lot of focus on closing the straits. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=108.46s)]
*  I don't think Iran can do that, but they do have the capacity to curtail energy supplies [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=111.44s)]
*  from the region if they would like to do so. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=116.12s)]
*  And why might they want to do so? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=118.52s)]
*  So we've seen a strategy from the Iranians before. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  Again, I bring up 2019. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=123.24s)]
*  We reimposed maximum pressure sanctions, basically said to Iran, you're not going to be able [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=124.96s)]
*  to sell your most important asset. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=129.36s)]
*  And Iranian officials said if we can't sell our oil, nobody can sell their oil. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=131.48s)]
*  And they specifically targeted critical Gulf energy infrastructure. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=135.36s)]
*  Again, they hit those tankers. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=139.2s)]
*  They hit pipelines. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=141.04s)]
*  And then in September, they hit the all-important Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia, the world's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  largest oil processing facility, temporarily taking off half of Saudi Arabia's production. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=146.84s)]
*  The goal was to impose economic costs on the United States on Western consumers for imposing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=151.89999999999998s)]
*  those sanctions. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  So if we look at the current situation, you ask, what cards does Iran have left to play? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=159.73999999999998s)]
*  Do they want to play the economic card? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  internationalize the cost of the U.S. and Israeli action. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=167.72s)]
*  And you can basically see what would happen to U.S. consumers if we had triple-digit oil [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=172.08s)]
*  prices. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=177.28s)]
*  You're going to be paying a lot more at the pump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=178.28s)]
*  What's the short-term outlook when it comes to gas prices for the American consumer as [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=180.52s)]
*  people are getting ready to go on summer vacations and are on the road more than they might normally [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=185.6s)]
*  be? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=191.2s)]
*  We are going into the peak summer driving season, heading into the Fourth of July. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=192.2s)]
*  Before this conflict broke out, people were pretty sanguine about the oil situation because [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  we don't have a such a shortage of supply on the market right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=202.04s)]
*  U.S. production has been strong. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=205.72s)]
*  We're getting more oil on the market from OPEC countries. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  There had been concerns about demand because of the trade war. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  So it wasn't set up for a summer of high energy prices. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=214.2s)]
*  All of that has changed with this Middle Eastern war, and we really have to see, does Iran [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=218.4s)]
*  make good on threats to impede traffic in the Straits of Hormuz? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=223.16s)]
*  Is other energy infrastructure at risk in the world's most prolific production zone? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=227.28s)]
*  Are there particular countries that would be hurt more than others if Iran decided to, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  if not necessarily, shut down all ships that are transiting through those Straits, but [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=239.8s)]
*  if they decided to go after a bunch of tankers? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=246.0s)]
*  I mean, oil is a global market, but I'm wondering if it really matters where those tankers are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=248.52s)]
*  destined for and if that means they can somehow hurt the United States or hurt China or hurt [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=254.36s)]
*  you know, Russia or some other country that they really want to put pressure on. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  Certainly we would all feel the effects of a blockage, again a blockage would be hard, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=268.6s)]
*  action in the Straits of Hormuz at targeted tankers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  We would all feel the effects because the global market, so gasoline prices in the United States [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  would rise. Now you brought up the issue of where does this oil go. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=281.88000000000005s)]
*  It does primarily go to Asia and Iran itself has been selling almost exclusively to China [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=285.88000000000005s)]
*  because of sanctions and there is a view out there in the market that Iran would not take [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  action to impede the flow of traffic in the Straits because they would not want to antagonize [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=296.68s)]
*  China. But if the Iranian leadership believes that they are facing a regime change effort, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=301.0s)]
*  are they going to care so much about keeping China well supplied or again are they going to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=307.72s)]
*  try to change the decision making calculus in places like Washington? And President Trump has [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=312.28s)]
*  been very concerned about inflation. He has been very happy that we have had lower gasoline prices [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=316.84s)]
*  recently. So again if you are the Iranians they may look to play the card they played in 2019 [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=324.84s)]
*  and try to drive up energy prices to make President Trump think again about the cost of this war. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=331.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. Hilly McRoth. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=338.28s)]
*  you [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlBtjtsNKE&t=354.84s)]
