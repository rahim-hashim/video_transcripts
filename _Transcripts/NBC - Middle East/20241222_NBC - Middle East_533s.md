Video Description: With Syria’s long civil war over and many countries hoping that Syrian refugees return home, the path forward is not so simple. Syria still lacks many basic resources and poverty is high. David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee says Syria is a “prototype example” of how conflict within a country can exacerbate poverty and worsen other issues like child malnutrition. Miliband says policy around Syrian refugees must “focus on the people” and “respect the choices Syrians themselves are making.”

# ‘Prototype example': How Syria’s civil war drove a refugee crisis still unsolved today
**NBC - Middle East:** [December 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM)
*  When the civil war erupted in Syria in 2011 after Bashar al-Assad's government used violence to repress nationwide [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=0.0s)]
*  Pro-democracy protests everyday Syrians were caught in the crossfire [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=7.4s)]
*  The city of Aleppo home to millions of people in millennia of cultural heritage was destroyed by fighting its civilians left without crucial [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=10.8s)]
*  resources and forced to flee in total nearly 14 million Syrians were displaced because of the civil war [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=19.04s)]
*  According to the UN's refugee agency most displaced within the country in about six million leaving the country altogether a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  vast majority of those six million refugees live in Syria's neighboring countries Egypt Iraq Jordan Lebanon and Turkey [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=34.6s)]
*  Turkey itself has taken in over three million Syrian refugees more than any other country [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  I've met with many of them in Jordan and Turkey. These are Syrian refugee children whom I met in Turkey in 2015 [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=48.6s)]
*  When those countries began limiting their asylum processes and when Assad began using chemical weapons of his own [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=54.919999999999995s)]
*  Syrians turned to Europe then Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel made her rally cry [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=61.04s)]
*  VIRSHAFEN DAS or we can do this as over 1 million Syrian refugees arrived in Europe between [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  2014 and 2016 Germany would take in the largest number of any European country in what would be known as the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=74.08s)]
*  2015 European migrant crisis the influx of Syrian refugees sparked a host of political consequences for the content for the continent [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=81.08s)]
*  It didn't help that around the same time the Islamic State began ramping up terror attacks across Europe fueling anti-muslim and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=89.04s)]
*  anti-immigrant sentiment much of the EU's political problems to this day stem from disagreements over migration [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  So when Bashar al-assad's government fell earlier this month the question on the minds of many was will the Syrian refugees get to go home? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=102.64s)]
*  Just a day after Assad was toppled Germany Sweden Norway Italy Denmark and Australia and Austria all [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=110.92s)]
*  Announced that they had paused their asylum process for Syrians other Europe European countries have followed suit Austria's government offered a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  1,000 euro bonus to Syrians who wish to return home although this was only after they considered outright deporting them [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=127.68s)]
*  Turkish politicians mostly those in the opposition party are offering to cover transport tickets and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=135.36s)]
*  Relocation costs for Syrian refugees to Turkey the tone of those offers was described as discriminatory by some in the Turkish press [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=140.6s)]
*  Many Syrians have shown an intention to return home [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  Whatever may be left of it in a June 2024 survey by the UN's refugee agency of Syrians living in Lebanon [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=152.32s)]
*  Jordan Egypt and Iraq [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=159.04s)]
*  57% say they'd like to return to Syria one day although many were unsure how soon that day would come [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=161.28s)]
*  But a premature push of Syrians back to the country could make it harder for that nation to get back on track [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=167.4s)]
*  Will Toddman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues quote flooding Syrians back makes the odds of a successful [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=173.68s)]
*  Transition in Syria even longer if too many refugees return at once it would increase pressure on strained public services [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=180.72s)]
*  Exacerbate social tensions and undermine the already slim prospects of a successful transition the consequences would not be limited [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=188.88s)]
*  To Syria end quote there are other obstacles too like the fact that the militia group now in charge of Syria is designated a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=197.04s)]
*  Terrorist group by the US and other countries which makes getting humanitarian aid to Syria complicated [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=203.88s)]
*  There's also still a fragile situation across the Middle East Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on Syria since the fall of Assad [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=209.76s)]
*  Israel said that these strikes are aimed at destroying military infrastructure [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Many Syrians who have been away for so long are excited by the prospect of rebuilding their country [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=221.32s)]
*  Faisal al-turki Najjar a Syrian refugee in Lebanon told the publication Middle East Eye as he packed his bags to return quote [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=226.52s)]
*  Syria needs people to rebuild it it needs people in the army the police force security health care all sectors if the good people do [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=233.92s)]
*  Not come back. It will be taken over by thieves and those who want to exploit the situation end quote [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=241.68s)]
*  That's a lot to unpack here and joining me to do this is David Miliband [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=248.27999999999997s)]
*  He's the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee. He's the former UK Foreign Secretary [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  He's the author of rescue refugees and the political crises of our time David. Thanks for being with us [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=257.0s)]
*  I really needed to talk to you to understand this because [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not binary right on one hand you want people to go back to their own country [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=267.32s)]
*  I think most refugees pray one day to be able to go back to their own country [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=272.32s)]
*  But this is really complicated to start with we're not sure what the country is right now in Syria [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=276.8s)]
*  We're not sure how stable it is and whether this militant group that has taken over has the capacity to even run the country [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=282.44s)]
*  Well, good morning Ali you've summarized the situation very well [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=290.52s)]
*  My organization International Rescue Committee has been working in the rebel held at parts of Syria for the 13 years of the Civil War [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=294.04s)]
*  So we've got experience of working under the rule of a range of armed opposition groups in the northwest of the country [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=301.32s)]
*  Including the Hayat Harir al-Sham group that is currently [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=309.28s)]
*  Leading the formation of a new government [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=312.96s)]
*  I think it's important to say that we never took Syria off our emergency watch list [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=315.8s)]
*  Some people said the war's over one we never fell for that because there were 16 million people inside the country in humanity [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=321.44s)]
*  Seven million refugees as you've explained outside the country [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=329.56s)]
*  I think the priorities now are one to respect the choices that Syrians themselves are making certainly [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=333.08s)]
*  Deporting Syrians back to Syria wouldn't be quite wrong [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=340.28s)]
*  But those who want to go back should be encouraged to do so for the reasons that you've explained secondly [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=343.76s)]
*  It's vital that the humanitarian aid is able not just to cross borders [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=349.48s)]
*  But to flow into the country without risk of getting caught up in the terrorist designation that you [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=354.26000000000005s)]
*  Referred to you may remember that when we spoke about the Afghan crisis and the fall of Kabul to the Taliban [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  We talked then about the importance of allowing humanitarian aid and humanitarian aid workers to do their work. That's critical [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=366.18s)]
*  Thirdly the health system of Syria needs to be sustained because without health people certainly won't go back. Then finally just for openers the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  Economy is absolutely key if there's hyperinflation it's going to be really [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=381.16s)]
*  Exacerbating what remains a very fragile political situation both inside the country the formation of a government after [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=386.16s)]
*  50 years of the Assad family's rule, but also you referred to the continuing military activity [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=393.2s)]
*  There's still the continuing activity from Turkey into northeastern Syria. So the political situation the geopolitical situation is also [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  extremely fragile [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=406.96s)]
*  One of the things that you have to think about and when you look at the countries that are on your emergency watch list [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=409.2s)]
*  They what they share in common is [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=414.68s)]
*  Difficulties in terms of governing capacity and and this is tricky particularly in this case in Syria where there is a terrorist [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=417.32s)]
*  designation on one hand [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=424.84s)]
*  That perhaps shouldn't dictate whether they're whether or not people are designated terrorists [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  But we have to figure out a way and you and your organization and other [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=431.4s)]
*  Organizations like yours have the ability to work [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  in places where [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=439.08s)]
*  The government has less capacity or may not be the ideal government [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=440.2s)]
*  That's sort of not your point your point is how do we help people who are internally displaced and externally displaced? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=444.12s)]
*  Well, we're focused on the people because if you don't support the needs of the people you're brewing up a political disaster [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=451.52s)]
*  And I think it's very important to say that our emergency watch list of 20 countries the real common denominator is conflict [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  That is the big driver of extreme poverty to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=464.32s)]
*  Poverty is going down in stable countries [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=467.52s)]
*  But it's even if when they're poor it's going up by about 80% in the last 20 years [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=470.32s)]
*  In countries that are caught up in conflict and there are 59 civil so-called civil conflicts going on around the world at the moment [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=475.48s)]
*  Syria is a prototype example of the modern [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=482.28s)]
*  Direction of extreme poverty. It's been caught up in conflict. There's many outside powers [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=486.08s)]
*  On state armed groups our point is as a humanitarian organization always focus on the people [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=490.62s)]
*  What are their needs if they're not being met, you know people will flee and they'll be trouble [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=497.26s)]
*  And I don't want to leave without reminding people to check your emergency watch list out [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  It will you'll learn a lot from it Sudan does remain the greatest humanitarian crisis at the moment that you're dealing with [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=507.26s)]
*  David thank you for your time [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  As always David Miliband is the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee author of the book rescue [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=516.2199999999999s)]
*  refugees and the political crisis of our time and it is important to go to rescue org and take a look at the emergency watch [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=521.5s)]
*  List to get a sense of how tough things are for folks around the world in this holiday season [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcoCarcDNM&t=527.7199999999999s)]
