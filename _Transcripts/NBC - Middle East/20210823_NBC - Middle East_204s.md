# At Least Three Babies Born In Course Of Afghanistan Evacuation
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo)
*  You may have also seen the reporting this weekend about a woman, an evacuee from Afghanistan, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=0.0s)]
*  who literally gave birth to a baby on board one of the U.S. military C-17 evacuation [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=7.0s)]
*  planes just after it landed at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=13.44s)]
*  It's just a crazy story. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=17.68s)]
*  It puts your heart in your throat to know that this woman was this pregnant, this close [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=20.28s)]
*  to delivering when she got herself and her family on board that C-17, and then to have [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=23.72s)]
*  given birth on the tarmac on board the plane. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  U.S. servicemen and women racing on board that cargo plane, delivering the baby right [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=31.4s)]
*  then and there on board the plane before they were even able to disembark her. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=35.8s)]
*  Mother and baby are both reportedly doing fine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=41.12s)]
*  But I have to tell you, that dramatic situation this weekend led to this question and surprise [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  answer at the Pentagon press briefing this afternoon. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen this footage today. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=52.96s)]
*  It started one way and then went dramatically off the rails to the surprise of everybody [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=55.28s)]
*  except one person in the room. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=59.36s)]
*  It went off the rails not in a bad way, but in a way that definitely makes me want to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=61.24s)]
*  know more. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=65.76s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=66.76s)]
*  I'm Therese Garnier with Newsy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=67.76s)]
*  General Lyons, are medics being provided for each flight? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=71.64s)]
*  I know there's a concern about capacity because you're trying to get as many people on, but [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=75.04s)]
*  are medics being provided? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=79.36s)]
*  And the reason why I ask that is because there are reports that a woman had a baby during [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=80.36s)]
*  one of the flights. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=84.28s)]
*  And so do you have medics that will be on board that will be able to handle any sort [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=85.64s)]
*  of emergency situations that may come up if someone has a baby or falls and gets sick [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  or something in that instance? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=93.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  We do not have medics on every flight. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  There is a medical screen as part of the screening and boarding process. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=101.64s)]
*  But I'll confess to you that many people would have to self identify any kind of medical [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  issue. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  It's really exciting. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=113.6s)]
*  I mean, I really appreciate the news reporting on the baby being born as that flight came [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=114.6s)]
*  into Ramstein. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=119.08s)]
*  Matter of fact, there's actually been more than that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=120.08s)]
*  So it's just a just an incredible, incredible operation ongoing, you know, just just impressive [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=123.32s)]
*  work by our great airmen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=131.88s)]
*  Yeah, what did you mean by that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  More than one baby? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  How many babies? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  So they're asking if there were more than one baby. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  No other babies? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, my my my well, my last data point was three. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't have a formal tracker, but those are the you know, so we'll keep you posted. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=154.08s)]
*  All right, sir. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  All right, well, we'll follow up and try to get you information on the other two. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  You hear all the reporters go, wait a second. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=163.68s)]
*  Did he say there's been more than that? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=166.84s)]
*  Does he mean when he says more than that, he means more babies? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  There's more little babies. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=172.2s)]
*  Somebody actually says there's more little babies. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=173.2s)]
*  There's more than one baby. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=175.08s)]
*  Admiral John Kirby, obviously flummoxed by this as well. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=176.56s)]
*  Did you just say three babies, sir? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=179.88s)]
*  We'll get more on the baby situation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oReSCgHROHo&t=182.64s)]
