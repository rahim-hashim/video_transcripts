# 'Make Iran Great Again?' Trump contradicts his top officials on potential regime change
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4)
*  The Trump administration is sending major mixed messages about whether it wants regime change in Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump posting on his social media site about two hours ago, quote, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=6.7s)]
*  It's not politically correct to use the term regime change, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  but if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't there be a regime change? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  However, top Republicans, including members of the Trump administration, were saying something else as recently as this morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  But our view has been very clear that we don't want a regime change. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=30.5s)]
*  I don't like the regime, but we're not into the regime change business here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=33.5s)]
*  We're into the safety and security of the United States business. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=36.6s)]
*  We are not pursuing regime change. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=39.4s)]
*  We're not trying to put any troops on the ground into Iran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=41.4s)]
*  And joining us now is Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=46.5s)]
*  an expert on Iranian-American relations and the author of Losing an Enemy, Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=51.2s)]
*  Also with us is Human Majd, an Iranian-American writer and an MSNBC contributor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=59.7s)]
*  Trita, I will start with you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=65.9s)]
*  What does the future of Iranian-American relations look like right now, and is diplomacy even realistically on the table? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=67.9s)]
*  I fear that real diplomacy, the ones that is actually used to constructively try to de-escalate, is a bit far away from us at this point. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=75.8s)]
*  There has been a massive destruction of trust just in the last 10 or so days. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=86.0s)]
*  At first, Trump said that he wanted to have talks last Sunday, but then apparently gave some sort of a greenish light to the Israelis to attack two days before the talks were supposed to take place. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=91.5s)]
*  Then he said that he's going to take two weeks to figure out what his next move is, and then two days later he actually attacked. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=103.1s)]
*  So at this point, I don't think the Iranians take what he says seriously in the sense of assuming that if he sends a positive message, they will take it at face value. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=109.5s)]
*  I think they're going to be assuming the absolute worst. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=117.8s)]
*  And under those circumstances, it's going to be very difficult to get real diplomacy going again. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=120.3s)]
*  Do you think they see that two-week period now, looking back on it, as a ruse of some sort? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  I think they viewed it as a ruse from the outset. I don't think they fell for it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=132.6s)]
*  I think this was something that was done to signal some confusion. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=136.4s)]
*  I think some of the things that have been tweeted today also does that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=140.4s)]
*  But I think it also shows something else. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=144.0s)]
*  It's not just that he sends mixed messages. He is moving the goalpost. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  Moving the goalpost to me suggests more that he's actually not in control of the escalation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu is, and Trump is actually following. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=155.4s)]
*  I find that to be very, very worrisome because if we take a look at what has happened over the course of the last couple of months, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=158.6s)]
*  Trump actually started off from a very constructive position. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=164.6s)]
*  He just said no weaponization. That was a workable approach. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  It would have likely led to a deal by now, I think, if he had stuck to it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=172.0s)]
*  But the Israelis pushed him to adopt zero enrichment instead, which we knew from the outset was not going to work. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=175.8s)]
*  Then they convinced him that the Israelis should go in and bomb. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=181.5s)]
*  Then they convinced him that the United States should go in and bomb. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=184.3s)]
*  And now it appears that they have convinced him that he needs to pursue regime change. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=186.8s)]
*  It doesn't seem to me that Trump is in control. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=190.10000000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu seems to be in control. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=191.9s)]
*  Hooman, NBC News reported that the Iranians wrote Trump that they would retaliate through terror cells if this strike did occur. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=194.3s)]
*  And so now they're put in the position of the strikes happen. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  And if they don't retaliate, they would not be standing with what they said. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=208.0s)]
*  And would it possibly? Is there any odds of that, basically? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=214.4s)]
*  It is a short way of saying is there any way that the Iranians will not retaliate? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  I find it unfortunate to me. Oh, sorry. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=225.6s)]
*  I doubt it very much. I mean, I don't think that it depends on what you what kind of retaliation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=229.5s)]
*  Retaliation may be not massive. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  It may not be them firing missiles into American bases and maybe more continuation of trying to. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  Fight the war with Israel, you know, really targeting that more than anything else. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=244.3s)]
*  It might be some proxies taking it upon themselves almost without necessarily a direct command from Iran. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  The Houthis, for example, who do have missiles and are able to cause damage. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=256.2s)]
*  But it depends. I think the odds of Iran absolutely doing nothing are practically zero unless unless Israel were to stop and say we're done. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  We're out. Trump were to say we're done. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=271.9s)]
*  We're out. And we want to sit with you and talk and have a negotiations instead of going to war. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=274.7s)]
*  I don't know if that would work, but I doubt that the Israelis are going to do that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=282.4s)]
*  And I doubt that Donald Trump is going to do that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=285.6s)]
*  So I think the answer to your question is no, I think there's going to be some form of retaliation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=287.5s)]
*  Treater, you wrote a book about the triumph of diplomacy, referring to the diplomacy between the United States under the Obama administration and Iran. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=292.3s)]
*  Trump, of course, pulled us out of the JCPOA in his first term. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=301.2s)]
*  Where do you think we would be today if that decision had not been made? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=306.3s)]
*  That's a great question. And I think if there had not been a pullout from the deal back in 2018, I think we would be in a fundamentally different situation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=313.8s)]
*  The deal would have been in place for 10 years, which would have given it enough time to start actually making significant changes to Iran, including internally. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=323.6s)]
*  Iran's economy would have opened up to the rest of the world, particularly to the West, which would mean that the West would also have leverage and influence over Iran's decisions. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  Now the West has zero influence, zero leverage, because it's simply not present. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=340.5s)]
*  It's not there. I think you would have seen the Iranian middle class grow dramatically, which is the main force for democratization inside the country. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=344.1s)]
*  Far more powerful than any regime change plans that would be cooked up from the outside. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=351.6s)]
*  So I think there's a tremendous amount that we have lost, not just in terms of nonproliferation, but also where Iran would be and where the U.S.'s relationship with Iran would be. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=356.0s)]
*  How that deal has been kept in place. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=365.2s)]
*  Homan, is regime change possible in Iran? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=367.8s)]
*  I mean, we've seen some reporting to suggest that Iran, the supreme leader, has made plans if in fact he is killed or targeted by either the Americans or the Israelis. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=371.3s)]
*  But is regime change possible? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=381.1s)]
*  And what might that look like? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's always possible, Homan. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=386.70000000000005s)]
*  It's always possible to bring about regime change, either from the outside or internally. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  Things could happen. I mean, you look at the Arab Spring. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  Nobody expected that to happen. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=394.8s)]
*  So it is possible and there is a lot of discontent in Iran. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  But there is no leader and there is no real opposition inside Iran. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=400.3s)]
*  And there's the opposition outside of Iran who potentially could replace the regime, are not really competent at this point, in the minds of the Iranian people. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=404.5s)]
*  There isn't this whole big groundswell of support, for example, for Reza Palaivi, the Shah's son, who fancies himself as being the next leader of Iran. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=416.4s)]
*  So, no, I think, of course, it's possible. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=428.1s)]
*  I'm not sure that Israel is pursuing regime change so much as either a disintegration of Iran. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=430.2s)]
*  We've even seen reports where they encourage some Israeli politicians to encourage the Kurds, the Arabs, the Baluchis to rise up to, you know, separatist groups. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=437.5s)]
*  So we could see that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=446.8s)]
*  We could see if there is an imposed regime change by decapitating the leadership, not just the leadership and the Ayatollah and the Islamic theocracy. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=448.0s)]
*  But also the Revolutionary Guards and the Iranian army and Navy and Air Force, that we could have complete chaos in Iran. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=460.1s)]
*  So I don't think I think that the Israeli it seems like the Israelis are more interested in weakening Iran to the point where it can never pose a threat to Israel or to Israeli interests. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  Let's put it that way in America. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=479.6s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump, it's impossible to say it's impossible to say what Donald Trump is thinking at any given time. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=482.0s)]
*  But I mean, just throwing out that regime change would be good is, you know, dangerous, I think, for for for everyone, because I think the Iranians will look at that and go, well, could that be America's main interest in Iran? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=487.70000000000005s)]
*  Houman Majd and Trita Parsi, thank you both. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=503.20000000000005s)]
*  We're grateful to have your voices tonight. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=506.1s)]
*  You [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksz31G1F6n4&t=517.6s)]
