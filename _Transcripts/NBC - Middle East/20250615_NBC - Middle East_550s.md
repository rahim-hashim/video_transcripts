# Trump rejected Israeli plan to kill Iran’s leader. Where does he really stand on the Middle East?
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg)
*  Let's bring in Ned Price, former special assistant, NSC spokesperson, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=0.0s)]
*  and senior director for the Obama administration. What is your reaction, Ned? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=4.24s)]
*  I think you said it, Alex. It's pretty extraordinary news. And I think, to my mind, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=10.24s)]
*  it raises two important questions. Number one pertains to Israel. What exactly are Bibi Netanyahu's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=14.56s)]
*  plans, intentions, and goals with this operation? But number two, and just as importantly, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=21.2s)]
*  where does the Trump administration stand on all of this? We've heard contradictory signals, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=26.88s)]
*  starting with the Israeli question. Look, Prime Minister Netanyahu and his ministers over the past [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=32.16s)]
*  72 or 96 hours or so have maintained that this is an operation about defanging the Iranian nuclear [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=37.84s)]
*  program, going after nuclear infrastructure, going after nuclear scientists, going after military [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  leaders as part of Israel's effort to defend itself from what they, I think, rightly deem to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=50.64s)]
*  be an existential threat to Israel if Iran were in a position to acquire a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=56.0s)]
*  But this kind of reporting, coupled with other reporting that we've seen that they've gone after [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=62.0s)]
*  or have sought to go after political leaders, I think raises a pretty disturbing question, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=66.64s)]
*  that this may not be purely about Iran's nuclear program, but this may be an effort to achieve [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=71.12s)]
*  regime change in Iran. That's something that the Israeli government has denied. But the more we [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=76.32s)]
*  learn, I think it's becoming clearer and clearer that may at least have been an initial objective [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=81.36s)]
*  of this, whether they're able to achieve it, especially with the reported American intransigence, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=87.44s)]
*  I think is another question. But that does take us to the United States. And where exactly is the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=91.92s)]
*  Trump administration in all of this? And I think as we've looked at President Trump's statements [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=95.92s)]
*  in the immediate hours before the Israeli operation started to just over the past couple hours, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=100.8s)]
*  we've seen contradictory signals. President Trump initially said no, he didn't want Israel to go [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=108.16s)]
*  against Iran while diplomacy was ongoing. He later called the effects of the initial effects of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=114.08s)]
*  Israel's operation excellent. After speaking with President Putin, he said he wants this war to end. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  And more recently, he has voiced encouraging noises about Israel needing to go after Iran's nuclear [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=126.16s)]
*  program. It's not just about contradictory messages and signals. This actually matters [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=132.4s)]
*  when it comes to foreign policy and America's influence in the world. Because when we're [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=137.12s)]
*  contradictory, when countries and entities don't know where we stand, they won't respect the word [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=140.8s)]
*  of the United States. They won't respect what comes out of the Oval Office. And unfortunately, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=147.6s)]
*  I think we've seen that from—yeah, go ahead, Ox. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=151.36s)]
*  No, but which plays right into my question in terms of Bibi Netanyahu saying he was not going [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=153.52s)]
*  to wait for the—wait anymore for the talks that the U.S. was conducting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Is this exactly what you're saying? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=167.76s)]
*  It's exactly what I'm saying. And it's pretty remarkable to have heard that from the Israeli [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=170.72s)]
*  prime minister. Look, I think when you take a step back and you assess Israel's operation and their [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=176.0s)]
*  initial impetus, it's very clear that in the first instance they were going after the Iranian [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=183.52s)]
*  nuclear program, of course. But when you start to peel back and to ask the question why, I think [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  it's impossible but to conclude that even though Iran's nuclear program was target number one, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=195.36s)]
*  Israel very clearly took aim at the Trump administration's own diplomatic effort. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  They did not want to see this go forward. And as I mentioned just a moment ago, even [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=206.24s)]
*  hours, minutes before the operation began, President Trump was saying he did not want to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=210.96s)]
*  see Israel strike Iran while diplomacy was ongoing. And you have to remember on Thursday, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=215.52s)]
*  in the hours before this took place, Steve Witkoffs, the president's special envoy, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  was supposed to meet with the Iranian foreign minister in Muscat today, just days later. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=224.48s)]
*  Clearly this diplomatic effort made the Israelis very nervous. Whether they were nervous that it [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  would fail and Iran would be in a position to acquire a nuclear weapon or I think more [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=234.88s)]
*  plausibly in some ways, they were concerned that it would succeed and that it would render what in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=241.44s)]
*  their mind what would have been a bad deal. I think either one of those could have been the final straw [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=247.04s)]
*  for Israel to go forward. The fact that Israel was saying they were targeting the supreme leader, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=252.88s)]
*  does that suggest to you they could get him if they wanted to? And the surprise around that, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=259.36s)]
*  and what if President Trump had not rejected the idea? What would we be looking at today? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=267.76s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think if you take a step back and survey the past three years, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=274.0s)]
*  one thing we should not do is underestimate the capabilities of the Israeli military and Israeli [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=278.16s)]
*  intelligence. And I think we've seen example after example from Hassan Nasrallah to the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=283.6s)]
*  Quds Force commander, to Ismail Haniyeh, the now deceased leader of Hamas, who was really ingeniously [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=290.8s)]
*  taken out inside Tehran in a guest house of the Iranian government just last year. My sense is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=298.0s)]
*  that if Israel wanted to go after the supreme leader, they could have gotten him. And Israel [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=306.32s)]
*  has time and again proven itself capable. But there is a difference between can and should. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=313.04s)]
*  And I think this gets to your question, just because Israel was in a position to go after [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=318.8s)]
*  the supreme leader, should they have done so? This is already a tender box. And unfortunately, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=322.56s)]
*  we are seeing missiles and munitions and drones rain over Israel just as they are doing so over [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=327.84s)]
*  the skies of Iran. It is in no one's interest. How were those missiles, drones, able to break [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=334.64s)]
*  through Israel's Iron Dome? It is typically iron clad, keeping missiles or rockets from breaking [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=343.28s)]
*  through. It is very effective, but no system, including the Iron Dome and David's sling, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=348.8s)]
*  is foolproof. And typically, when we saw this, unfortunately, twice during 2024, when there was [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=354.88s)]
*  an exchange of fire between Israel and Iran, there was a very high success rate, but it is not 100%. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=360.72s)]
*  What we saw over the course of last year, somewhere around 5% of drones and missiles were able to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=369.92s)]
*  get through. That is what I think we are seeing now. It is also a question in my mind just how [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=377.36s)]
*  coordinated the United States and Israel are. Look, I can tell you, Alex, in the Biden [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  administration, we spent a good amount of time and effort coordinating closely in an intelligence [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=388.0s)]
*  level, at a military level, and a political level with our Israeli counterparts. And we were able [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=394.64s)]
*  together to effectively shoot down almost all of those munitions, whether ballistic missiles or [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=399.76s)]
*  drones. I do not know yet whether the success rate here is equivalent to that, if it is less than that, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=405.6s)]
*  but it is very clear that no system is foolproof, and we are seeing the tragic consequences of that, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  which is all part of this potential for a broader conflagration. It is in no one's interest [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  to see this conflict spiral even more than it has. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=424.0s)]
*  I have one more question for you, Ned, and that is, is there a purpose in this leak of information [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=426.48s)]
*  from the White House saying that the president rejected Israel's baby Netanyahu's request, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  or saying, you know, we are going to take out the Ayatollah? What is that about, the leak? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=440.0s)]
*  There is always an ulterior motivation, and we do not need to be a criminologist here to [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=446.64s)]
*  understand that the White House is in a very difficult political dynamic. On the one hand, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=452.08s)]
*  they feel that it is necessary to stand with Israel, to support Israel. That is in part, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=457.92s)]
*  at least, why President Trump has himself said that we are going to continue to work with the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=462.4s)]
*  Israelis to shoot down these drones and ballistic missiles, but there is a very powerful political [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=466.8s)]
*  strain that President Trump listens to, his MAGA base. This is the so-called America First base, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=471.68s)]
*  the base that at this very moment is questioning why the United States is engaged, even in a limited [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=476.56s)]
*  way we are, to help Israel defend itself. I think what we are hearing from this White House, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  these whispers that the Israelis wanted to go further and faster and do something even more [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=488.8s)]
*  dramatic, but President Trump vetoed it, is a very purposeful leak to signal to that MAGA base that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=493.04s)]
*  President Trump is going to defend Israel, but we have our limits, and we are not going to be [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=499.44s)]
*  drawn into a broader war. Look, I hope that remains the case, that we will not be drawn in, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  but President Trump time and again has shown that he is mercurial, and the last person he talks to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  typically wins the argument. So I hope those principles remain. I hope the United States [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=515.36s)]
*  continues to stand with Israel to help it defend itself, but will resist being dragged [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=519.92s)]
*  into something that I think could be very violent, very ugly, and unfortunately very deadly. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxPIwCvkmmg&t=525.28s)]
