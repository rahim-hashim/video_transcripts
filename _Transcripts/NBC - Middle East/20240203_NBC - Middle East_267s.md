# 'This is a conflict about Iran trying to export its influence' - Former NSC Director
**NBC - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik)
*  Let's talk about what's going on, because I think our viewers need to have a really [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=0.0s)]
*  good understanding of why this is all kind of coming to a head, and most importantly, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=4.9s)]
*  why Iran itself is using proxies to be able to wage the types of attacks and terrorist [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=10.44s)]
*  attacks that it's doing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=16.44s)]
*  You know you're right, very few people look at it from the 60,000-foot level, and it's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=18.7s)]
*  important to do so, because this is reflective of Iran's general foreign policy objectives [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=21.84s)]
*  across the region. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=27.5s)]
*  Their goals are to destabilize the region so that they can increase their influence [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=28.92s)]
*  across the Middle East. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=33.28s)]
*  At the heart of this is not a conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  This is a conflict about Iran trying to export its influence, the Shia crescent, as I'm sure [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=38.96s)]
*  you've also heard. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=45.96s)]
*  At the heart you have a fight between Sunni and Shia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=47.32000000000001s)]
*  I know that that simplifies it a lot, but that is what's at the heart of this, and as [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  a result of that, they do not like U.S. presence in the region, which is specifically there [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  to counter terrorist groups, because if we are not there, they will proliferate even [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=58.68s)]
*  further and export their nefarious and destabilizing behavior, and that is what is at the crux of this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=62.72s)]
*  So let's talk practical matters then. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=70.0s)]
*  How does the United States keep this from escalating into something bigger? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=72.04s)]
*  Considering the fact that we've already had a United States-Britain response in the Red [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=76.4s)]
*  Sea, in the Southern Red Sea, to the attacks by the Houthi rebels from Yemen, who are a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=80.76s)]
*  terrorist organization and are Iran-backed, we have obviously, like I mentioned to General [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=85.68s)]
*  Steph Twitty, this issue in Israel with the Lebanon border, when it comes to Hezbollah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=90.16s)]
*  I mean, these are all backed terrorist organizations, courtesy of Iran. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=95.76s)]
*  Isn't it just a whole lot of fallacy to sit there and say that Iran cannot be involved [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=100.72s)]
*  in this, especially with the United States now having three service members killed? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=105.68s)]
*  Well, you're right to say that Iran is 100 percent involved. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=109.92s)]
*  Even if they're not ordering or executing every single attack that is taken by these [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=114.76s)]
*  Iran-backed groups against military bases and outposts that are American in the region, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=120.8s)]
*  at the end of the day, these Iran-backed groups would not exist and would not have these capabilities [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=126.4s)]
*  if it weren't for Iran, because Iran is the one that funds them, arms them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=130.36s)]
*  They send, they train them, they give them intelligence capabilities to know where to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=134.52s)]
*  target. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=138.64s)]
*  These are, at the end of the day, juvenile toddler kind of terrorist groups, if you will, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=139.64s)]
*  for militias. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=144.4s)]
*  They would have this capability if it weren't for Iran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=145.4s)]
*  So it is, you can't say that Iran is not involved. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=147.68s)]
*  And that is why you saw the U.S. go after these logistical targets and locations where [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  they are, yes, they are Iran-backed groups, but some of them are straight up from the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=158.16s)]
*  IRGC. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  So some of them are Iranian. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  They're just outside of Iran's borders. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  But that said, I want to be clear here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=167.4s)]
*  These are, this is activity that would have, that was taking place before Israel-Gaza [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=169.12s)]
*  conflict. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=173.68s)]
*  It worsened when that happened, because for them it was an opportunity to seek legitimacy [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=174.68s)]
*  by goading the United States into a war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=178.72s)]
*  Hikar, I got about 30 seconds, but I wanted to ask you about this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=180.88s)]
*  Before the airstrikes happened on Friday, a lot of people don't know, but there were [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=185.08s)]
*  charges that were lodged against people that were facilitating the sale of oil to be able [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  to help Iran and Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=191.96s)]
*  How effective are those measures, the sanctions and the criminal charges that are sought by [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  the United States government? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=201.8s)]
*  Yes, sanctions can be very effective. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=203.8s)]
*  But unfortunately, one of the things I can tell you, having worked in sanctions for a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=205.84s)]
*  long time at Treasury, is that when you close one loophole, these nefarious actors are usually [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=209.08s)]
*  able to try and find others. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=213.96s)]
*  It's kind of like a game of whack-a-mole. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=215.44s)]
*  So they do work, because not only do they isolate them from the U.S. financial system, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=217.08s)]
*  but by exposing who it is, what front organizations they use, what vessels they use, which business [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=221.56s)]
*  people they use, it unleashes these market forces around the world where everyone says, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  OK, we won't do business with them either. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=232.2s)]
*  But it is a constant effort. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=234.56s)]
*  You can never sanction and then just rest on your laurels. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  It is a constant effort to enforce them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbjxG5MnEik&t=238.44s)]
