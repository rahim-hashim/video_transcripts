# Would be 'stunned' if Iran 'didn't try to move' uranium from Fordo: Ret. Lt. General
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A)
*  Joining us now, NBC News White House correspondent Monica Alba, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=0.0s)]
*  Melanie Zanona, MSNBC political analyst and chief White House correspondent at The New [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=5.38s)]
*  York Times Peter Baker, and retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=10.22s)]
*  He previously served as the commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Monica, the president was really hyping up this press conference last night. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Bring us the top takeaways and what it might mean for today's Senate briefing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=23.32s)]
*  And I think the fact that this press briefing took place is significant in and of itself [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=27.28s)]
*  because they don't often hold those briefings with any kind of regularity over at the Pentagon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  So the fact that the president was pushing his top officials here to come forth and try [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  to continue to argue this narrative that they clearly want front and center to combat the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=40.72s)]
*  early intelligence assessment that came from the Pentagon's own intelligence agency is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  clearly a communication strategy as much as it is one where they are trying to project [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=51.24s)]
*  this era of transparency, even if they didn't answer a lot of the crucial and key questions. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  But this is about the Trump administration trying to come together and put all of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=62.48s)]
*  information that they feel backs up the president's own really definitive claims in one place. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=66.32s)]
*  And they're doing that by citing Iranian officials. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=72.0s)]
*  They're citing Israeli Atomic Energy Commission assessments. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  They're citing other information as we wait to get the complete picture from the U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=78.72s)]
*  intelligence community, which we should note will take a lot of time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=83.72s)]
*  That's not something likely that would be available when we're here less than a week [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=87.16s)]
*  out from those bombings of the Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  But specifically, the defense secretary, Pete Hegson, seemed to be performing here for an [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  audience of one, as you had mentioned earlier in your show, this idea that for Donald Trump, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  it's very important to come out before cameras and present a clear defense of his decision [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=104.63999999999999s)]
*  making. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=110.88s)]
*  He's been doing that since leaving NATO, all on social media repeatedly over and over again. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=111.96s)]
*  He wanted to be sure that his officials could come and provide more information, too. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  But General Dan Cain, who's the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he provided a lot more actual [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  tactical specific information that we learned a little bit more on the strikes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  And I think that was part of the administration's effort, too. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=131.16s)]
*  But as you mentioned, that classified briefing behind closed doors, there could be a different [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  tone to about some of this information that came out early. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=138.64s)]
*  And so that leads me to Melanie. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  How are lawmakers approaching today's briefing as they've been trying to get answers for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=143.28s)]
*  days now? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=147.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's been a lot of frustration on Capitol Hill, particularly among Democrats [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=148.0s)]
*  about the level of communication between the Trump administration and members of Congress. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=152.28s)]
*  Remember, at this point, most members of Congress still have not received a classified briefing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=157.2s)]
*  on the situation on Iran since those strikes on Saturday. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  And that includes top members of Congress in the Democratic Party. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, some Republican leaders like Speaker Mike Johnson said they have been receiving [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=169.56s)]
*  classified briefing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=172.68s)]
*  But as a whole, Congress is largely being left out of the loop. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=174.12s)]
*  So there are a ton of questions that members have, in top of mind being just how successful [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=176.96s)]
*  was that strike? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=182.6s)]
*  Here's Democratic Senator Warner. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=183.6s)]
*  I mean, there was lots of debate in the public domain before this action was taken about [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=187.36s)]
*  whether the bunker busters could actually destroy all of these facilities. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  And again, I'm hopeful there's as obliterator as close to obliterated as possible. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  But if they're not, then what next? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=205.96s)]
*  I mean, does that mean future military action? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  And so we'll see just how satisfied lawmakers are walking out of this briefing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=213.12s)]
*  It is going to be classified. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=217.38000000000002s)]
*  It is going to be Senate wide and the House will receive their classified briefing tomorrow. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=218.72000000000003s)]
*  But like I said, just a lot of questions top of mind and a lot of frustration going both [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=223.92s)]
*  ways between the administration and Congress over all of this right now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=227.08s)]
*  General, what questions would you have for the defense secretary? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=230.56s)]
*  Well, number one, I would ask what's the strategic objective that this operation is supposed [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=235.8s)]
*  to move towards? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=241.4s)]
*  This was never clear from the beginning of what happens next. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=243.48s)]
*  Even if the strikes were 100% successful, then what? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=247.64s)]
*  So the problem when you focus so much on an operation without putting it in a proper strategic [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=252.64s)]
*  context, it really these are the kind of questions I think that members of the House and Senate [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=259.52s)]
*  want to answer. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=266.68s)]
*  The second thing I would ask is why didn't the secretary and the president listen to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=268.36s)]
*  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs when he counseled patients? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=273.24s)]
*  It takes a long time to get accurate BDA, battle damage assessment, but the pressure [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=276.8s)]
*  from the civilian leadership to hurry up and get something out there is why we are in this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=283.24s)]
*  mess right now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=288.04s)]
*  I have to say, I don't know General Cain, but I'm more impressed with him each time [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=289.8s)]
*  he has to step out there because he seems to be a voice of calm professional reason. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=293.08s)]
*  And then the third thing, look, I know that there's a lot of pressure involved in this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=300.2s)]
*  It's hard to answer questions from the press all the time, but for the secretary of defense, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=306.76s)]
*  a government official to lash out at members of the media by name in some cases because [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=311.12s)]
*  they don't like the coverage, I think not only is it very, it's a terrible example [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=318.36s)]
*  for the secretary to set for all the hundreds of thousands of his subordinates, but also [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=326.0s)]
*  in the oath to support and defend the constitution, there is this thing about freedom of the press. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=331.84s)]
*  And so in my mind, he's stepping over his oath to support and defend the constitution [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=336.96s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=343.56s)]
*  Peter, the White House has from day one before any intel assessment happened, has been saying [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=344.56s)]
*  that Iran's nuclear facilities were obliterated. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=354.11999999999995s)]
*  Is this an administration that will accept any intel that suggests otherwise? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=356.96s)]
*  Can the American people have confidence on the info this White House is sharing? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=361.88s)]
*  Well, the signal the president has sent is he wants the intelligence to fit his preconceived [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=366.28s)]
*  outcomes, what he wants the outcome to be. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=372.23999999999995s)]
*  Now, it may be that he did achieve the outcome that he is describing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  We don't know that these intelligence reports are preliminary. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=377.96s)]
*  They are still gathering information. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=381.6s)]
*  More information will be assessed by professionals who know what they're talking about. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=383.6s)]
*  But no question that the pressure and the signal from the White House is that the intelligence [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=388.52s)]
*  ought to suit what the president wants it to say. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=392.96s)]
*  That's not the first time that's happened in our history, but it's obviously problematic [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=397.16s)]
*  in a lot of ways. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=400.92s)]
*  Policymakers need accurate, dispassionate, detached intelligence to make reasoned choices, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=402.8s)]
*  not intelligence that suits what they already want to believe. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  Now, instead of, of course, quarreling with the intelligence in some ways, the president [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=413.52s)]
*  prefers to quarrel with reporters. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=418.84s)]
*  It's an easy thing to do. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  Shoot the messenger is a long-standing tradition in our capital, in a lot of capitals. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  These are reporters, though, who have accurately reported what the Defense Intelligence Agency [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=427.4s)]
*  preliminary intelligence showed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=431.4s)]
*  That intelligence may not be complete. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=434.12s)]
*  That intelligence may be supplanted by other intelligence, but it's obviously not the reporter's [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=435.64s)]
*  fault for reporting accurately on what they have learned. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=440.2s)]
*  That's something of great public interest. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=443.2s)]
*  Now, the president wants this to be true. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=445.12s)]
*  It wants it to be true that these facilities were obliterated because he wants to basically [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  declare an end to the operation, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  If there's intelligence suggesting that it didn't quite get everything, then he might [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=454.24s)]
*  come under pressure to have another operation, which I think he doesn't really want to do. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  General, this morning, Defense Secretary Hegseth was asked about Iran's enriched uranium stockpile. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=469.08s)]
*  Do you have certainty that all the highly enriched uranium was inside the Fordow Mountain [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=471.56s)]
*  or some of it because there were satellite photos that showed more than a dozen trucks [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=477.8s)]
*  there two days in advance? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=482.24s)]
*  Are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=483.98s)]
*  Of course we're watching every single aspect. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  We're looking at all aspects of intelligence. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=488.76s)]
*  I'm not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=490.36s)]
*  were supposed to be, moved or otherwise. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=494.72s)]
*  Then you have the president asserting on social media that this uranium stockpile wasn't moved [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=497.92s)]
*  ahead of the strikes and saying that with some sense of certainty, although general, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=502.92s)]
*  we do know that the International Atomic Energy Agency had been notified by Iran as far back [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=507.92s)]
*  as June 13th that they were going to take specific measures to protect those stockpiles [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  and to protect their nuclear capabilities. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=519.78s)]
*  So how concerning is this, the discussion and the way that the administration currently [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=522.46s)]
*  is framing it? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=527.16s)]
*  Well, the worst thing here is that people are going to lose confidence in our great [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=529.16s)]
*  intelligence professionals because they'll begin to perceive that the intelligence that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=533.64s)]
*  does get out exactly as Peter was describing is something that was contorted to meet the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=539.14s)]
*  narrative needs of the White House or it was leaked because somebody disagreed with what [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=544.68s)]
*  was out there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=551.68s)]
*  This is not only bad for our decision makers and our leadership, but also our allies. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=553.5999999999999s)]
*  We depend so much on other nations, their intelligence agencies working closely with [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=557.7199999999999s)]
*  ours. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=563.0s)]
*  This intelligence sharing is a two-way street, and this damages our intelligence capabilities [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=565.4799999999999s)]
*  when people begin to lose confidence in our intelligence process. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=571.28s)]
*  For me, this is the biggest danger here. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  I would be stunned if the Iranians had not moved or had not tried to move some of the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=579.48s)]
*  materials out of there because there's been so much talk in the last weeks about a possible [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  strike and certainly the Israelis had telegraphed this. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=590.2800000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, nobody should be surprised if the Iranians actually were able to move some [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  materials out of there. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=599.2s)]
*  That's why the patients let the processes, and we've got the best in the world, let the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=601.5200000000001s)]
*  processes work so that we know. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=606.64s)]
*  Yeah, and I also wanted to mention that the International Atomic Energy Agency said just [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=609.64s)]
*  this morning that there are other nuclear facilities in Iran that were not hit. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=614.08s)]
*  So they would maintain the capabilities at those places as well, you would think. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=619.24s)]
*  So Peter, I also wanted to ask you about what we're hearing from Speaker Johnson, who's [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=624.16s)]
*  arguing that the War Powers Act, which limits presidential power to wage war, is unconstitutional. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=627.04s)]
*  So I'm going to ask you, Peter, in the last few minutes, I'm going to ask you a question [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=632.68s)]
*  that I've heard from the speaker. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=635.68s)]
*  Do checks and balances still exist in Washington? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=636.68s)]
*  Well, this is a bipartisan issue, actually going back over multiple presidents. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=639.68s)]
*  Multiple presidents of both parties have basically quarreled with the War Powers Act or failed [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=644.68s)]
*  to abide by it because they said it didn't apply in this circumstance or that circumstance. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=649.68s)]
*  Basically, since the end of World War II, Congress has abrogated its responsibility [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=654.68s)]
*  to the Constitution to declare war, and the executive, in this case, President Trump, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=659.68s)]
*  but other presidents as well, have taken it upon themselves to say, look, in my job as [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=663.68s)]
*  commander-in-chief, I have the responsibility and the right under the Constitution to use [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=667.68s)]
*  military force in limited ways short of a full-on war. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=671.68s)]
*  The question is whether this operation would qualify as that. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=676.68s)]
*  Is this, is the Iranian nuclear program posing a direct national security threat to the United [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=679.68s)]
*  States? Does this qualify as a war if it's a one-off military operation that destroys [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=685.68s)]
*  these facilities given that there are no ground troops and no continuing operations? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=690.68s)]
*  These are questions that have been raised on Capitol Hill. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=694.68s)]
*  They're being raised by Democrats, but in the past, they've been raised by Republicans. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=697.68s)]
*  And I think that this is a sign of how our war policy, our war power policy, in effect, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=702.68s)]
*  has evolved over the years, giving great latitude to presidents to use force without [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=708.68s)]
*  Congress participating. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhk7jnic8A&t=713.68s)]
