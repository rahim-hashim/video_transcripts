# Iran launches retaliatory strikes against Israel
**NBC - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw)
*  Now on to the escalating conflict in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, Iran is launching a new wave of retaliatory strikes after Israel's attack on the country's [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=8.42s)]
*  And Iran is now saying the United States was complicit in the attacks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=9.42s)]
*  It comes as NBC News learned. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=13.92s)]
*  The U.S. helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were targeting Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=15.6s)]
*  The nightcap is still here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=19.78s)]
*  Colonel Jack, you know I'm going to first. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=20.78s)]
*  Israel is calling this a preemptive attack rather than preventative. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Explain to us the difference and what's your take on all of this? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=29.76s)]
*  How imminent is the real threat here? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=32.36s)]
*  Well I think preemptive is probably the wrong term to use. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=34.44s)]
*  I think it is preventative. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  Preemptive suggests that you expect an attack on you to be imminent. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  And that's not the case here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  Everybody's been working really hard for decades to try to get the Iranians to quit producing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=55.84s)]
*  I had a conversation 40 years ago with Menachem Begin right after they attacked the Osirak [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  reactor in Iraq. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=68.0s)]
*  You attack the Osirak reactor, why don't you go get the Iranians? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=70.0s)]
*  They're going to produce a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=75.44s)]
*  And he said accusatorily, because you guys won't let us do it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=78.92s)]
*  It has brought us exactly to where we are today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=85.36s)]
*  It would have been lots better off had we encouraged the Israelis to attack Iran back [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=89.12s)]
*  then. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=94.6s)]
*  Now it looks like they've got about a significant percentage of what's required in order to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=95.6s)]
*  produce maybe about nine or ten nuclear weapons. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=104.08s)]
*  And they're buried deep underground. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=108.28s)]
*  Israel not surprisingly wants to do something about it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=113.2s)]
*  And we have been helping them with logistical assistance, with intelligence assistance. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  And the attack on Iran is just beginning. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  Ultimately they're going to have to go after the nuclear stockpiles that are near Qom, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=132.88s)]
*  which are deep underground. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=139.32s)]
*  How they're going to do it is difficult to envision, since it's going to require weapons [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=140.64s)]
*  Israel does not have. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  How long do you think it will last? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  It's likely to last at least a couple of weeks. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=150.88s)]
*  I mean Israel's saying that it's going to last weeks and not days. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=152.88s)]
*  And there are going to be casualties on both sides obviously, as we saw today when Iran [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=158.42s)]
*  fired missiles. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=166.0s)]
*  I tell you one thing that's really kind of interesting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=167.36s)]
*  You remember the last time there was an exchange of fire between the two. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=170.8s)]
*  The sky was full of incoming missiles from Iran. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=175.2s)]
*  Not this time. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=179.96s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=181.88s)]
*  One argument is that a lot of the capability was eliminated in the initial attack by Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=183.64s)]
*  And there was not much left over from the last time that they exchanged missiles. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=190.2s)]
*  Another argument is that Iran is keeping its powder dry and doesn't want to use all [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=195.74s)]
*  of its weapons, or the majority of its weapons, until later on when it can. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=200.22s)]
*  Or it feels like its back is up against the wall and they'll really start in earnest to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=205.38s)]
*  bombard Israeli cities. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  But whatever the reason is, we haven't seen, we didn't see last time and we haven't seen [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=212.9s)]
*  the volume of fire coming from Iran that we saw last time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=219.96s)]
*  So let's go to Israel. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=223.9s)]
*  How much of this is about Netanyahu's legacy? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=225.04s)]
*  Their biggest strike on Iran, took out military leaders, took out top scientists. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=228.98s)]
*  Is this about his legacy? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=233.94s)]
*  I'm sure he thinks it's about his legacy, but I think it's a little early to say whether [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=234.94s)]
*  or not this is going to be a net positive for his legacy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  Is it his intention? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=241.26s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=243.14s)]
*  I think a lot of his supporters and people in his inner circles have even been using [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=244.14s)]
*  the word legacy for the last couple days. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=248.68s)]
*  There's a few other things on Netanyahu's plate, like his corruption trial, like a war [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=251.86s)]
*  in Gaza that is not yet over, that doesn't really have a day after plan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  So there's a lot of things that could define his legacy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=259.88s)]
*  I think he is hoping that a big massive attack that totally shifts the paradigm of the power [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=263.3s)]
*  of balance in the Middle East and makes it so that Israel's enemies or perceived enemies [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=269.54s)]
*  feel like they could never encroach on them again or make threats about wiping them off [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=276.24s)]
*  the map. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  I think that's the motivation, but whether or not it's going to be successful, whether [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  or not Netanyahu's legacy will be defined positively by the things that are happening [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=285.66s)]
*  right now, way too soon to say. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEQuLyZA4bw&t=289.56s)]
