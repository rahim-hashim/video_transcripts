# Americans Eager To Be Part Of Afghan Rescue Mission
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE)
*  Is there going to be a sort of call to the American people and to civil society organizations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=0.0s)]
*  in the United States to help resettle people, to do community resettlement efforts, to donate [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=7.96s)]
*  things that these new families may leave, to find them housing, to get them in English [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=15.0s)]
*  as a second language courses, if they're going to be resettling here? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I know that not everybody's going to be coming to the United States, but thousands [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=21.72s)]
*  are. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=25.16s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=26.16s)]
*  I mean, it's a big nail from the U.S. government, indeed from the Defense Department, for the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=27.16s)]
*  American people to step up and help. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=30.64s)]
*  Well, we're actually starting to see that, Rachel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=32.36s)]
*  I mean, certainly lots of non-governmental organizations are already helping the State [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=34.64s)]
*  Department and DHS as these Afghans are ready to move into American society. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=39.36s)]
*  They're already going to relocation centers and getting help starting their new lives. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=44.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=50.36s)]
*  But you know, the commanding general of Fort Bliss, Texas, where some have already gone [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=51.36s)]
*  for this, the follow-on final paperwork that they have to complete before they can become [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=56.16s)]
*  citizens, has said that he's been deluged with phone calls and emails from the people [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=61.16s)]
*  living outside Fort Bliss, Texas, just wanting to know what they can do, blankets, food, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  whatever they can do to help. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=72.24s)]
*  So we're already starting to see the American people in many of these communities really [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  reach out and want to do what they can to help what will be their future fellow citizens. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=77.4s)]
*  I will tell you just anecdotally from our experience, we're just a cable news show [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=83.4s)]
*  that covers this process and that's covered some individual stories of people who have [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=87.88s)]
*  been evacuated with their families. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=92.36s)]
*  And we have been inundated with requests just from our viewers in terms of how they can [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=93.88s)]
*  help. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=97.96s)]
*  And so I know that you're in a different role as the press spokesman at the Pentagon, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=98.96s)]
*  but I think there is a real hunger among the general public watching this to want to step [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=102.08s)]
*  up and do something, especially as we learn more about how hard these flight crews are [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=106.64s)]
*  working and how hard these thousands of U.S. troops are working to try to make the best [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=111.8s)]
*  of this very difficult situation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  I do think there is public appetite to do something, sort of put our money where our [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=117.56s)]
*  mouth is, to be part of this process in some way. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that's, I mean, I doubt we'll hear that from you at the podium, but [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  I do feel like we have to hear that from the administration, from the government in some [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=130.8s)]
*  way because that needs to be channeled in some way. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=135.56s)]
*  It's too valuable to leave on the table, it seems to me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=137.68s)]
*  No, I agree, Rachel. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=140.88s)]
*  And I think, you know, this is what's quintessentially so great about our country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=141.88s)]
*  Americans are a generous lot and we are an immigrant nation and we are used to these [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  stories, sad and desperate though they may be, and we are used to reaching out to people [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  that are in need and really want to start a new life here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=157.76s)]
*  So I think, you know, just that one little base in Texas is just one small example. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=160.92s)]
*  I think you're going to see that all over the country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  And again, that's one of the great things about living in this country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=167.6s)]
*  And I think these Afghans, that'll be something that they take away, too. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-0UyyevbQE&t=170.36s)]
