# Afghanistan Withdrawal: 'The Reality Is We'll Be Leaving Americans Behind'
**NBC - Middle East:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8)
*  Joining me now is Evelyn Farkas, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=0.0s)]
*  Evelyn, I'll ask you first just your thoughts, your biggest takeaways from the briefing that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=5.36s)]
*  we just listened to here a few minutes ago. Well, Aaron, thanks for having me on. And I'm [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=9.76s)]
*  going to try not to cry because I've been on the phone texting with Afghans and with Americans and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=14.24s)]
*  Germans trying to help them get out. Listening to the briefing, it's obvious that our military, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=20.16s)]
*  our government is trying really hard now to get people out. But the reality is that we're not [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=27.36s)]
*  doing enough. The parameter is it needs to be expanded. People cannot get to the airport [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=32.32s)]
*  safely. The people that I'm communicating with are on list. They actually should be on planes by now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=38.56s)]
*  But they can't get to the airport in safety. And once they get to a gate, they're often not admitted. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=44.8s)]
*  Part of the problem has to do with charter flights. The Marines apparently are not [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=50.96s)]
*  checking charter flights. They need a gate for charter flights. And the bottom line, Aaron, is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=54.56s)]
*  that I don't think there's enough time. There's also paperwork problems, American citizens whose [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=58.72s)]
*  children don't have the paperwork to prove that they're Americans, but of course they are. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=64.64s)]
*  They're waiting for paperwork for crying out loud. They should be allowed in and brought into the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  parenter, onto the airport and onto flights. And I hear charter flights are going out without all [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=74.72s)]
*  the seats full, in fact, barely full. So the bottom line is there's a lot more that can be done [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=80.88s)]
*  if people make decisions about extending the parameter, about going out to get more people [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=86.16s)]
*  from collection points. And this is something I'm hearing not just from Americans and Afghans, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  but also again, as I mentioned, from Germans. And I think we can do better. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  I want to go a little deeper into several of the points you just made here. We have exclusive [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=101.2s)]
*  reporting here at NBC News on an internal State Department cable that detailed the betrayal and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  distrust felt by Afghan U.S. embassy personnel in particular. We'll put on the screen here, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=112.56s)]
*  quote, it would be better to die under the Taliban's bullet than face the crowds at the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  airport again. A staff member was quoted as saying in that cable. In your opinion, what can, what [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=123.36s)]
*  should the U.S. government do to help Afghans who worked with them and folks who didn't, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=129.36s)]
*  but are still at risk in Afghanistan right now? Yeah, Aaron, I mean, that quote's really [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=134.88000000000002s)]
*  interesting because I got a quote from someone else who said that the feeling was that now the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=140.0s)]
*  U.S. government is complicit in all of the atrocities and the behavior of the Taliban and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=145.28s)]
*  others in that parameter. So, I mean, the Afghans who are working for our embassy are right. I mean, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=151.28000000000003s)]
*  it's almost more dangerous for them to leave whatever safe area they're in. But of course, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=157.28s)]
*  that safe area is temporary. So what we need to do is provide humanitarian parole. I mean, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=162.08s)]
*  if people have one scrap of paper or someone who can vouch for them in the U.S. or another [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=167.76s)]
*  government or an NGO or media organization, we ought to be able to get them on a plane and get [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=174.4s)]
*  them out. They are clearly not terrorists. And the U.S. government can do that. We can provide [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=179.04s)]
*  humanitarian parole. The Department of Homeland Security does that all the time. And that's what [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=184.56s)]
*  you do just to get someone out of harm's way. They can sort out the paperwork problems later. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=189.04s)]
*  And frankly, you know, a lot of these people, they don't even care. They'll go to another country [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=193.52s)]
*  as long as they can get out of Afghanistan and they can sort out reunions with their families [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=198.24s)]
*  later. But the reality now is that we will be leaving Americans behind. Just the example I [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=202.8s)]
*  gave you before about Americans whose children don't have their paperwork. No mother and father [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=207.52s)]
*  are going to leave their children behind in Afghanistan. That means those American citizens [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=213.52s)]
*  will by definition be needlessly left behind. So I think, again, as I said, expand the security [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=218.0s)]
*  perimeter, get more security to go out and collect people from at least Kabul, if not beyond Kabul. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=223.44s)]
*  And I know some of the reporters have been asking about beyond Kabul. We need to do better by the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  people, especially American citizens. And then, of course, the Afghans who helped us. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=234.4s)]
*  And very quickly, before I let you go, I do want to ask you a little bit more about the potential [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  threat here. We learned about ISIS being a potential threat for Americans and at the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  airport in particular in the days right after President Biden tried to sort of quell some of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  the concern about terrorist groups in the region. What's the real depth of the threat there from [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=252.08s)]
*  your understanding? And could it be a real danger for the ongoing operation there? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=257.44s)]
*  Well, Aaron, obviously there's always an ongoing terrorist threat, but it doesn't have to be from [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=264.0s)]
*  ISIS. It could be, of course, from al-Qaeda elements who are still in Afghanistan. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=268.56s)]
*  The Taliban themselves are a menace every day to some extent because, of course, the Taliban don't [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=272.72s)]
*  control all their rank and file. But I would say that as long as you don't have intelligence on an [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=277.92s)]
*  imminent threat, on an attack that's likely to occur any minute, you can mitigate the risk. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=284.32s)]
*  You just have to conduct yourself the way the military knows how to conduct itself. The Marine [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=291.44s)]
*  Corps and other elements of the U.S. military know how to secure a perimeter and know how to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=296.4s)]
*  mitigate the threat posed by terrorism. Yes, if there's information, intelligence on an imminent [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=302.0s)]
*  attack, that's a different story. Then we have to halt our efforts and make sure that we are [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=307.67999999999995s)]
*  sufficiently protected, that our forces are also protected, meaning our military. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  All right. We will leave it there for now. Evelyn Farkas, we appreciate your time today. Thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkYLRPZtm8&t=326.4s)]
